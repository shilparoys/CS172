          <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="maincontent">Barracuda Spam Tool Update</span>
          <span class="maincontent"><br> </span> 
          <p class="maincontent">In November, we transitioned from Postini, a hosted spam service, to the Barracuda Spam Firewall, which is a device that is installed locally on campus. The primary reason for this transition was the ability to provide all mailboxes, including adjunct email accounts, with spam filtering capabilities.&nbsp; On a monthly basis, this device is delivering approximately 8-10% of all the mail sent to the College to your mailboxes and blocking the remaining 90% of the mail sent to the College.&nbsp; This translates to blocking over 1,000,000 mail messages monthly. These numbers are reflective of the overall increase, estimated at as much of an 80%, in spam messages sent via the Internet beginning in October.<br> <br> </p> 
          <p class="maincontent">As we continue the transition to the Barracuda, its effectiveness is enhanced by each user "black listing" the spam messages in their quarantine. To learn more about this feature and other Barracuda features, we welcome your participation in the OIT Technology Education Series class "Using the Barracuda to Filter Your Spam" offered on April 17 from 2 – 4 p.m. To register for this class, please contact the OIT Help Desk at ext. 4900.</p> 
          <span class="maincontent"><br> Additional questions regarding spam and the Barracuda should be directed to the OIT Help Desk, ext. 4900. We are especially interested in users that are continuing to receive large amounts of "inappropriate" spam. In these cases, please contact us so that we can investigate your account.</span> 
          <p class="maincontent"><span><a id="password" name="password"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br> Password Policy</span></span><span><br> </span> <span><span>As you know, Camden County College is committed to maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of social security numbers for all of our constituents. A number of policies and initiatives have been recently implemented assuring that the privacy of such institutional data will be better secured.&nbsp;One such policy that has been developed by the College's Information Technology Planning Group (ITPG) and approved by the President's Cabinet is a network and administrative systems password policy. (See Attached Policy).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p> 
          <p class="maincontent">Highlights of the password policy include the following:</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-All network and e-mail passwords must be changed every 180 days.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">- All passwords must conform to the guidelines described below:</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters in length and contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, and one numeric character.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Passwords should not include any words from a spelling dictionary.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Passwords cannot be the same as the user's ID or contain a proper name.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-A password cannot be the same as the past 3 passwords.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Accounts will be locked after three failed attempts for the duration of 15 minutes.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Passwords should not be shared with anyone, written down, or posted on a computer or monitor.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Users calling the Help Desk for password resets will be asked to verify their identity.&nbsp; The following information will be required for verification:</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-College Personnel – Birthdate (month, date, year), last four digits of SSN, and employee ID&nbsp; Number</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">-Non-College Personnel – Required to present valid photo ID, in person only.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">&nbsp;</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">Please note that adjunct faculty e-mail account passwords (OWA) will not expire, however, when changing their password, they will need to follow the complex password standards.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">We appreciate your cooperation with this new policy and assisting in safeguarding the College's institutional data.&nbsp;</p> 
          <p class="maincontent">Thank you.</p>

          <p class="maincontent"><br> We anticipate Windows Live Mail to be made fully available by Microsoft this fall. While Microsoft is readying its Windows Live Mail environment, students will be provided a Microsoft Hot Mail account with 250MB of storage space.</p>

This new process will be initiated by the Human Resource department once an employee is hired. A newly revised Network/Telephone Access form (see attached) will be completed by the Human Resources department with input from the new employee's supervisor.

          <p class="maincontent">Maintenance is scheduled every Wednesday night from 10 p.m. – 6:00 a.m. that will temporarily impact network services. Examples of the tasks that require this 'down time' include installing new life cycle network switch gear, routers, server hardware and/or upgrades; installing Microsoft security patches on Windows servers; and modifications to application, service, email, printing and security configurations.</p>

          <p class="maincontent">First, we remind everyone that your Outlook mailbox needs regular maintenance. You should delete emails that you don't want, or need, delete items from your Sent Items folder and delete out of date contacts from your contacts folder. Remember to "empty" your deleted items folder as a last step in this process. Also, perform the same cleaning in your personal folders. If you find mail items that you wish to keep please move them from your Outlook today mailbox to a personal folder. If you have questions regarding maintaining your mailbox please contact Help Desk @ ext. 4900.<br> <br> </p> 
          <p class="maincontent">Please take a few minutes to review the content of your department's G: drive and your own H: drive. Remove any data files that are no longer in use. Simply delete them (remember to empty your recycle bin when you are finished).</p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> OIT also reminds you that data content stored on the network is backed up for a period of two weeks, any changes to your data older then this are not necessarily available should you accidentally delete it. Therefore, it is important to remember to save your most important data regularly and even make your own copy to removable media.</p>

          <p class="maincontent"><br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Network What?!?…..Network Drives</span><font color="#003366"><a style="font-weight: bold;" id="Drives" name="Drives"></a><br> </font> <span>The Camden County College network offers many different tools for you to use. Network drives provide you with options to store your information or data. These drives can be found under My Computer. There are currently four different network drives at your disposal. They are G: for Group (departmental), H: for Home, S: for Campus_ Share, and T: for shared applications. The following definitions reflect what can be found on these drives.</span></p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> The G: or Group drive, is a department specific drive that enables your department to share and access information. This drive is helpful when you or a member of your department wants to share or post something particular to the department.The H: or Home drive is a personal network drive accessible only under your user login. This drive can be used to store your personal documents and to backup data that is stored on your local "C" drive. The benefit to using the H drive is that you can access your files from any computer within the college, since they are stored on the network.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> S: or Campus_Share drive allows a user to create a folder to store and share documents and forms that other users need to access campus wide. This drive should not be used to store personal or confidential documents, since others will be able to access it. Presently, a sub-committee from ITGP is discussing the restructuring of this space to allow users to more easily find and access college-wide information.T: or Apps drive houses shared applications such as MS Office, Datatel, U.I., Message Manager, Visio, etc. The program applications within this drive are running when users login, given their profile and number of site licenses for the software allowed. This drive does not allow users to add or install software to this network drive or store their documents.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> Questions regarding your network storage space can be directed to the Help Desk, ext. 4900.<br> <br> </p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><span><strong>Managing Internet latency <a id="latency" name="latency"></a>-</strong> Internet bandwidth consumption<br> </span> <span>Over the past few years, the college allocated significant resources strengthening the college network to provide everyone access to various applications, only to have the lowly MP3 file nearly bring the network to its knees.</span></p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> In order to ensure optimal use of our network and Internet bandwidth (network and internet traffic) and to limit security risks related to the installation and use of unauthorized software, please remember that the college network is for teaching and learning and appropriate office use only. (Refer to the "Guide for Acceptable Use of Technology" updated fall 2010.) Bandwidth is a commodity, and we want it to be available when it is needed. When the college's Internet access is used for personal reasons, such as downloading music for non-teaching purposes, the entire college is affected by a slower running system and less space allocated to do required tasks.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> OIT is looking at ways to overcome application performance issues, while providing an expedient solution to network congestion. Network bandwidth consumption is growing due to increasing traffic and user volume as well as transaction sizes.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> Where do we go from here, how do we make sure resources are available for everyone when they need them? If money were no object, we could throw enough at this problem and have the biggest pipes on the market. Or we may look at various technologies to assist us in managing network traffic.</p> 
          <p class="maincontent"><br> There are application-intelligent traffic management systems that assign priority and bandwidth amounts. We do not want to affect teaching and learning or decide who needs to access what resources. We do however; want to make sure that computer classrooms have priority, and that college applications used by employees to conduct college business have priority. We will not infringe on academic freedom or negatively impact legitimate use of any services, but we do want to ensure quality of service (QoS). With everyone managing how they use college network resources we can get in front of some of our network latency issues. If that is not enough, then with appropriate software we can allow required protocols through and allocate bandwidth/priority to the appropriate applications.</p>

Camden County College has adopted Outlook Web Access as the official means of doing this for full time faculty and staff. Outlook Web Access can be reached by typing <a href="/Adjunct Email.htm"><font color="#3300ff">owa.camdencc.ed</font>u</a> in the address field of Internet Explorer or by selecting the Outlook Email link in the Faculty and Staff section of the College web site. By adopting Outlook Web Access as the default mail client, faculty and staff have a multitude of new features and accessibility to their email then ever before with standard mail clients like Netscape. Some new features include the ability to view and modify your personal calendar, an online task list, a global College directory of email address, a single personal address book accessible from home or office (no need to synchronize), and access to Exchange public folders. Since the new system is web-based, it is easier for you to get your mail then ever before. There are no settings required on your machine. Simply type owa.camdencc.edu from your home PC, office PC, any PC on campus or around the world (provided they have internet access) to retrieve you mail. If anyone needs assistance in using Outlook Web Access please call our Help Desk at extension 4900.</span></p>

So far this month we have received over 4000, which in not uncharacteristic. This type of activity occurs when new variants of viruses are written. This month the college received emails from 2 new viruses. Since the most common way for a virus to procreate is though email, the college has a special version of Norton Anti-Virus specifically written for Exchange Servers (our mail server) to protect our mail. This software automatically scans all inbound and outbound mail for potential viruses. If Norton finds a virus, it will automatically remove it from your mail. Norton also alerts you that the original mail contained a virus and it was removed. Norton also notifies the sender of the virus to make them aware that they are infected and OIT network staff. This process keeps OIT staff abreast of the potential virus threat constantly. Norton is automatically updated every 3 days to prevent a new virus from slipping into the campus.</span></p> 
          <p class="maincontent" align="left">If you have received a notification that Norton has found a virus in your email that is a good thing. That means that the software has protected your computer and your files from the virus. Sometimes you may receive several notifications regarding the same virus. Viruses typically use the victim's address book to send itself to more victims. Depending on how the viruses are written it could continue to send itself out every so often to stay healthy. This will occur exponentially until everyone on the Internet updates their anti-virus programs to fully eradicate the virus. Unfortunately, OIT cannot prevent you from receiving multiple emails of a virus threat. If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding viruses please do not hesitate to call our help desk at extension 4900.</p>
