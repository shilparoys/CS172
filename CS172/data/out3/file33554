     <title>Mark Johnson: The unsung Magic man of the Miracle on Ice </title> 
     <description>
      &lt;span class="clip_outlet"&gt;NY Daily News&lt;/span&gt; MADISON, Wis. — For Mark Johnson, the guy many believe to be the best of a group of 20 kids who shocked the hockey world 35 years ago today in Lake Placid, heaven comes on a sheet of ice measuring 32’ x 58’ just a few yards off his back patio. It’s his own man-made rink, the one he started building 12 years ago when he moved to this edge of Madison, the home of the University of Wisconsin.

     <title>Conroy: Cuts to UW System could seriously hurt state's economic growth</title> 
     <description>
      &lt;span class="clip_outlet"&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/span&gt; Wisconsin is in a fight to create good-paying jobs for the 21st century economy. Wisconsin’s trend of declining household incomes only will be offset if we can generate new, good-paying jobs and stop the exodus of college graduates to other states. The recent proposal to cut $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System’s budget, in the absence of a concrete plan to ensure that our standards of excellence remain intact, will strike a blow to a key source of potential economic growth and undercut a major opportunity to translate the system’s scientific research into new, high-growth companies and jobs.

     <title>Bo Ryan Is Weaned to Win in Wisconsin</title> 
     <description>
      &lt;span class="clip_outlet"&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt; PLATTEVILLE, Wis. — As one approaches this town of 11,000 in the southwest corner of Wisconsin, the largest letter M in the world looms to the north. Made of 400 tons of whitewashed limestone, measuring more than 200 feet in each direction and symbolizing the University of Wisconsin-Platteville’s mining tradition, it is peaked on the kind of hill not ordinarily seen in the northern Midwest.

     <title>Don't shortchange state's future economy</title> 
     <description>
      &lt;span class="clip_outlet"&gt;Wisconsin State Journal&lt;/span&gt; The Republican governor’s plan to cut $300 million from the University of Wisconsin System is troubling. Allowing UW campuses more flexibility from state bureaucracy to save money is fine. But the governor wants the System to absorb what would amount to a 13 percent cut in state funding while maintaining a tuition freeze for two more years. No amount of efficiency, short of damaging layoffs, is going to offset that in the short run. Moreover, tuition hikes after a freeze expires could price some in-state students out of a Wisconsin school.

      &lt;span class="clip_outlet"&gt;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&lt;/span&gt; To attract interest in a class on conservation and hunting, it’s helpful to invoke the name of Aldo Leopold. To reach the largest audience, a free, online course has virtually unlimited potential. The University of Wisconsin in Madison will put those concepts to work later this month when it offers "The Land Ethic Reclaimed: Perceptive Hunting, Aldo Leopold and Conservation."
