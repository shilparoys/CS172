               <p>This course traces the history of Christianity from the death of Jesus to the break up of the Roman empire (seventh century) and the rise of Islam. Important theological questions (such as: who is Jesus [Christology]; what does he do [soteriology]; the nature of God; why is there evil in the world [theodicy]) are considered and placed in the context of ancient Roman history and philosophy. These considerations help us to understand the meaning of Christian martyrdom, the effect of Constantine's conversion, the origins of Christian worship and sacred space (Constantine's St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, in particular), ecclesiastical and clerical orders (bishops and priests, for example), monasticism, the doctrine of "original sin," and apocalyptic expectations. The appeal of alternate Christianities such as Gnosticism and Arianism and the decline of Classical religion are also considered. Offered fall semester in even-numbered years.</p>

               <p>The art of the Italian Renaissance from the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries is examined in this course. Painting, sculpture and architecture of major artistic centers such as Florence, Rome and Venice and the diverse social structure of these autonomous city-states will be the main focus. Major figures such as Brunelleschi, Masaccio, Michelangelo, Cellini, and Titian are examined in a variety of political, social, and religious contexts. Issues concerning the paragone, the changing status of the artist, artist's biographies and the construction of identity, wealth, patronage both private and public, women, and the process by which art is made and changing philosophies of conservation are some of the topics discussed.</p>

               <p>This course traces the history of Christianity from the break up of the Roman Empire to the reformations of the sixteenth century (Protestant and Catholic). Important topics include: the rise of the Papacy, the break with Byzantine Christianity, monasticism, sacred space, the medieval "discovery of the self," the mendicant orders (Franciscans and Dominicans), Eucharistic theology, the origins of the university, natural theology, late medieval mysticism, and the break up of Christendom in the sixteenth century. "Popular" religious practices, such as cults of the saints, miracles, and the unique artistic genius of the medieval cathedral are placed in a broader context. Fruitful Christian coexistence as well as violent conflict with Islam and Judaism are also considered, as are the multiplicity of "heretical" Christianities (including Catharism and Waldensians).</p>
