To that end, we make our clinical services available to any member of the community at a reasonable cost.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">The preventive services of cleanings, x-rays, athletic mouth guards, plaque control, fluoride treatments, sealants and nutritional counseling are offered. We are committed to providing the highest standard of care for our patients within the scope of Dental Hygiene Practice as established by the New Jersey State Board of Dentistry. The Clinic is open to the public, and is under the supervision of a licensed dentist. Services are performed by students who are monitored by licensed hygienists. </span> </p> 
              <center class="style3"> 
               <span class="style4">Clinic Information and Patient Responsibilities </span> 
              </center> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><b>Appointments<br> </b></span><span class="style5">The clinic is located on the Blackwood campus in the Kevin Halpern Hall for Science and Health Education, Room 107. </span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">Appointments can be made by calling the reception desk at (856) 374-4930.Appointments for oral prophylaxis (cleaning teeth) are scheduled for three hours - 9 am to 12 noon and 1 pm to 4 pm. As with any teaching institution, individual services require more time than a private setting. Your treatment may require several lengthy visits. Each step of the procedure is carefully evaluated by an instructor. Therefore, you must expect to wait during the procedure.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><strong>Screening (New Patients)</strong><br> An individual who has never been a patient in the dental hygiene clinic must be screened by the staff dentist before being accepted as a patient. At the screening appointment, the patient will fill out a medical/dental history form, have vital signs taken, and complete an oral exam. Those individuals who are accepted as patients may make an appointment for treatment at this time.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><b>Patients of Record<br> </b></span><span class="style5">Patients who have been previously seen in the hygiene clinic may be scheduled for a cleaning appointment without having to repeat the screening process. However, if it has been more than seven years since your last appointment, it may be necessary to be screened again.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><b>Late or Broken Appointments<br> </b></span><span class="style5">Since it is essential for the patient to respect the student's commitment to education and patient care, we require at least 48 hours notice for a cancellation. It will be considered a broken appointment if proper notice is not given. If two broken appointments occur, the patient will be dismissed from the clinic. If a patient is more than 20 minutes late for an appointment, the student will treat another patient.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><b>Rules Regarding Minors<br> </b></span><span class="style5">Adult patients scheduled for clinic should not bring their young children. We have no facilities for babysitting and cannot assume responsibility for unattended children.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">All patients who are minors must have the clinic form signed by a parent or guardian prior to any clinical procedure. The parent or guardian must remain in the waiting area while the patient is approved for treatment by the instructor. We expect parents/guardians of children under 12 years of age to remain until treatment is completed. Should the parent/guardian leave the clinic after treatment starts, we must have a phone number at which he/she can be reached in case of an emergency. </span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">The patient must be picked up by the end of the clinic session. A child patient cannot leave the clinic alone.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><b>School Closing<br> </b></span><span class="style5">The school closing number for Camden County College is 559. If the college is closed, the clinic will also be closed. (Listen to KYW Newsradio 1060 AM.) You may call to reschedule.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5"><b>Parking<br> </b></span><span class="style5">Patients may park in white lined spaces only. Kevin Halpern Hall is handicap accessible, including special parking area, a ramp, and an elevator to the second floor. Parking tickets are issued by Security for any infraction of the parking rules. </span> </p> 
              <center class="style3"> 
               <span class="style4"> Health Considerations </span> 
              </center> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">All patients seen at the Dental Hygiene Clinic are required to fill out a comprehensive Medical and Dental History Form, with updates at each subsequent visit, and must sign a consent form before treatment can be rendered.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">Patients with medical or dental histories indicating past or present conditions will be evaluated by the staff dentist and clinical faculty to assess a patient's medical needs. A medical clearance form sent to the patient's physician may be warranted.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">It is important that patients report any history of communicable disease. Examples include hepatitis, HIV infection and tuberculosis. It is our policy that individuals who have a potentially infectious disease will not be denied access to clinical services.</span></p> <p class="style3"><span class="style5">It is important that patients disclose any previous illnesses that require special precautions, such as, but not limited to, mitral valve prolapse, prosthetic joint replacement, heart valve replacement or congenital heart defect. All medical information is considered strictly confidential and will be utilized to help us to treat you in a safe and appropriate manner. </span><span class="style5">Patients requiring pre-medication will not be treated if they have not taken their medication as directed. </span><span class="style5">Patients taking medications are encouraged to bring their medicines with them to each appointment. </span></p> <p class="style4">Clinic Fees</p>
