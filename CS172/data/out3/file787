      &lt;h3&gt;Leading political strategist Stephanie Cutter at Drew on March 3.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-92041" src="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/Cutter_Stephanie_PROMOPIC.jpg" alt="Cutter_Stephanie_PROMOPIC" width="400" height="600" /&gt;The United States is gearing up for another presidential election, and Stephanie Cutter, who held leadership roles in the White House and in winning presidential election campaigns, will share her political wisdom at Drew University on Tuesday, March 3, at 8 p.m. in the Concert Hall of the Dorothy Young Center for the Arts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cutter’s political and communications experience spans two decades in public service and the private sector. From the West Wing, to the campaign trail, to the halls of Congress, Cutter has crafted communications strategies for the nation’s leading political figures, campaigns and Fortune 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She served as deputy campaign manager for President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and chaired the President’s Inaugural Committee. She also previously was deputy senior adviser to President Obama, counselor to the secretary of the department of treasury and Michelle Obama’s chief of staff on the 2008 Obama for America Campaign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cutter, founder of the Cutter Media Group, also served as an adviser and political strategist for President Bill Clinton, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Senator John Kerry and Minority Leader Harry Reid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cutter is the latest speaker in the Drew Forum series, which brings noteworthy speakers—including American statesmen, foreign heads of state, nationally known journalists and noted historians—to the Drew campus. Leon Panetta, former director of the CIA and secretary of defense, among other notable posts, will close out this year’s speakers on April 20.

      &lt;h3&gt;Drew is sole New Jersey site showcasing original Shakespeare publication.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_92032" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width: 400px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/Shakepeare_Inside2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-92032" src="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/Shakepeare_Inside2.jpg" alt="Shakespeare First Folio, 1623. Folger Shakespeare Library." width="400" height="599" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Shakespeare First Folio, 1623. Folger Shakespeare Library.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;An original Shakespeare First Folio, printed in 1623, will be exhibited in October 2016 at Drew University—the sole New Jersey location for the Folio exhibition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The national traveling exhibition, organized by the Folger Shakespeare Library and the American Library Association, will mark the 400&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary of Shakespeare’s death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The First Folio is one of the earliest published collections of Shakespeare’s works, compiled by two of his actors who published about 750 copies after Shakespeare’s death. First Folio copies known to remain total 233, and without the Folio, no record of 18 of Shakespeare’s plays, including &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Twelfth Night&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;The Tempest&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Comedy of Errors&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;As You Like It&lt;/em&gt;, would exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The First Folio exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Shakespeare and His First Folio,&lt;/em&gt; done in close partnership with The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, will be accompanied by performances, seminars and lectures, all open to the public. While on display, the Folio itself will be open to Hamlet’s “to be or not to be,” the opening verse to one of Shakespeare’s most quoted soliloquies, and &lt;em&gt;Hamlet&lt;/em&gt; will be performed by Drew’s nationally ranked Department of Theatre and Dance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew will also showcase the Folio with local students through its program with Newark Public Schools and host seminars and lectures for the public featuring Drew faculty experts. A companion exhibit of rare books contemporary to the First Folio, drawn from Drew’s own collection, will be displayed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a tremendous honor for Drew and a wonderful opportunity for our students and the community,” said President MaryAnn Baenninger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The 36 plays preserved in this ancient book have for centuries helped us to understand, even to define, what it means to be human,” said Chris Ceraso, chair of Drew’s Department of Theatre and Dance and author of Drew’s application to host the First Folio. “To have the book itself, and the accompanying exhibit, housed for a time on our campus, is not just a prestigious honor, but also the perfect embodiment of the liberal arts mission, especially when paired with the performance &lt;a href="http://www.shakespearenj.org/AboutUs/mission.html"&gt;mission of The Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;Partnership with The Seeing Eye focuses on nonprofit management and fundraising.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/SeeingEye_Inside.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-92028" src="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/SeeingEye_Inside.jpg" alt="SeeingEye_Inside" width="450" height="485" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Drew University students are learning about nonprofit organizations and fundraising directly from leaders in the field through its partnership with The Seeing Eye, the oldest existing guide dog school in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Seeing Eye pairs blind and visually impaired individuals with trained Seeing Eye Dogs ® to enhance the independence, dignity and self-confidence of people who are blind and visually impaired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew Student Philanthropy Ambassadors will join a roundtable discussion with leaders of The Seeing Eye and other organizations after attending the Festival of Sound, a gala concert featuring the Beacon Hill Musicians that benefits The Seeing Eye. The gala concert will be held on March 21st at 8 p.m. at the Bickford Theatre at the Morris Museum. For more information about the concert and to purchase tickets, please visit &lt;a href="http://festivalofsound.eventbrite.com"&gt;festivalofsound.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion will focus on running a nonprofit organization and planning successful fundraising events and campaigns. Nonprofit leaders at the discussion will include Michelle Barlak, senior associate of public relations with The Seeing Eye, Marty Eigen from the Beacon Hill Jazz Band and Dr. Neil Manowitz C’70, a dedicated volunteer who helped connect the student ambassadors with The Seeing Eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Seeing Eye is pleased to partner with Drew University and offer its students the opportunity to learn about the planning of the Festival of Sound fundraising event,” said Michelle Barlak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a great opportunity for our students to have an out-of-the-classroom experience and see the inner workings of a successful nonprofit group,” said Julia Frieri, assistant director of Drew Alumni and Parent Relations. “We look forward to doing more partnerships in the future that bring together Drew students and community partners.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew’s Student Philanthropy Ambassadors celebrate philanthropy on the Drew campus and organize philanthropic events and campaigns throughout the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;Six months after graduation, 94% of respondents from Drew’s Class of 2014 were working or in graduate/professional school.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;February 6, 2015—&lt;a href="http://www.drew.edu/career/wp-content/uploads/sites/67/outcomes-2014.pdf"&gt;A recent survey by the Drew Center for Career Development&lt;/a&gt; showed successful placement of Drew’s most recent graduating class in the workforce or in graduate or professional school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of the Class of 2014 reported employment in organizations such as Google, Coca-Cola, Chubb Insurance, Merrill Lynch, the Federal Trade Commission, ING Financial Partners, Morgan Stanley, Novartis and Prudential, and acceptance into graduate programs at Harvard, Duke, Princeton and Columbia, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Drew students graduate with the critical skills they need to succeed, as this report shows. Even more importantly, they have the flexibility to adapt to and flourish in the dynamic and rapidly changing demands of the global workforce,” says Chris Taylor, dean of the College of Liberal Arts. “This offers further confirmation of the value of a liberal arts education in general, and of a Drew degree in particular.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;Robert Massa to lead newly integrated team.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;February 12, 2015—President MaryAnn Baenninger named Dr. Robert Massa, former chief enrollment officer at Johns Hopkins University and Dickinson College, senior vice president for enrollment and institutional planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/Massa.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-91979" src="http://www.drew.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2015/02/Massa.jpg" alt="Massa" width="400" height="602" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“I am thrilled that Bob Massa will join Drew—his expertise and record of success in enrollment management make him an invaluable part of the team as we work to ensure that Drew continues to thrive in the increasingly competitive world of higher education,” said Baenninger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Massa, who most recently served as vice president for communications at Lafayette College, will lead a newly integrated enrollment, retention and admissions marketing team at Drew that includes admissions, financial aid, enrollment operations, retention coordination, athletics, the center for career development and the registrar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A veteran of over 40 years in higher education, Massa noted, “At its core, Drew is a very strong liberal arts institution, with dedicated faculty and staff, great programs, motivated students and loyal alumni. I believe in President Baenninger’s vision for Drew, and I look forward to joining the great team she is gathering.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No stranger to challenges in college admissions and financial aid, Massa joined Dickinson College as vice president in 1999 when applications, enrollment and revenue were down. He worked closely with Bill Durden, then the new president of Dickinson. “He was all fired up and had the concrete plans to translate passion into results,” said Durden. “Working with me, the CFO, the dean of the college and others, Bob developed and implemented strategies that helped to get Dickinson back on the global map as a first choice school for many. Applications, enrollment and revenue all increased in short order. MaryAnn Baenninger, who I know and respect, and Bob Massa will make an unbeatable team.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Massa joins Drew with a deep understanding of its strengths and challenges, and keen insight into its enrollment operations. He has worked closely with Baenninger as a consultant for several months. “Bob devoted five months to studying Drew’s admission and aid policies and practices, and issued a comprehensive report with recommendations for Drew to move forward. His leadership in this area will help shape Drew’s future success,” noted Baenninger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Massa lives in Branchburg, New Jersey, with his wife, Ellen, a fifth grade teacher in Berkeley Heights. They have four grown children and three grandsons.&lt;/p&gt;
