          <p>The Frank Lanza Memorial Scholarships recognize the outstanding academic and leadership accomplishments of students who are enrolled in regionally accredited community college programs in registered nursing, respiratory care or emergency medical services. Phi Theta Kappa annually awards up to 20 scholarships of $2,500 each, a total of $50,000 in scholarships each year.</p> 
          <p>Applicants must have completed 50 percent of their course work leading to the attainment of an associate degree by June in the year they apply for the scholarship. (Certificate students are not eligible to apply).</p> 
          <p>Eligible students may begin applying for this scholarship in February and applications are due in May. An independent team of judges reviews the applications to determine scholarship recipients. Phi Theta Kappa notifies students selected as Lanza Scholars each August/September.</p> 
          <p>In honor of L-3 Communications founder Frank Lanza's visionary business leadership and generous commitment to charitable causes, Lou Oberndorf, founder and retired Chairman of METI, initiated the endowment of the Frank Lanza Memorial Scholarship, which was funded by L-3 Communications, METI (now CAE Healthcare), the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), and Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society.</p>
