     <h2 class="academics">The Value of a Liberal Arts Education</h2> 
     <p>A liberal arts education not only benefits you but meets a need in society. Employers want to hire people who can think clearly, adapt in a rapidly changing environment, and easily transfer skills and information. As our American and world culture become more complex, we need liberal arts graduates because they can think critically, communicate effectively and solve problems creatively. At Westmont, we also encourage you to develop your character and faith and become a well-rounded person.</p> 
     <p>By taking classes in a wide range of disciplines, you learn to make connections among apparently unrelated information. The liberal arts teach you breadth, connection and integration. Your professors focus on teaching you and helping you acquire the knowledge and competencies you need to succeed in a wide variety of careers.</p>

     <h2>Art</h2> 
     <p>Art at Westmont, taught in the new Adams Center for the Visual Arts, provides courses in ceramics, sculpture, photography, design, printmaking, painting, drawing, and art history. Through our Westmont Ridley-Tree Museum of Art, which frequently hosts exhibits and lectures by visiting artists, students can experience gallery management and curatorial practice with an internship or employed position. Those interested in graphic design may choose the studio art major with a graphic design emphasis and will study in a facility devoted to computer graphics, photography and sculpture.</p> 
     <p>For study beyond campus, we offer programs in England, Italy, New York and San Francisco.</p>

     <h2>Biology</h2> 
     <p>Biology at Westmont includes cellular &amp; molecular and environmental studies &amp; natural history tracks. Our students gain extensive lab and fieldwork experience through five teaching laboratories and a variety of off-campus opportunities. With our campus ideally situated for marine or terrestrial biology, we offer frequent trips to local beaches, an Elephant Seal Rookery, and Anacapa/Santa Cruz Islands. Students will also visit the Los Padres National Forest and Yosemite National Park, with further opportunities through the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History and Santa Barbara Zoo.</p> 
     <p>Those who wish to study off-campus can take part in the Au Sable Institute of Environmental Studies programs, which offers summer experiences in a variety of locations, or the semester-long Creation Care Stewardship programs, with sites in Belize and New Zealand. Biology additionally now has an affiliation with all Duke University field study programs.</p>

     <h2>Chemistry</h2> 
     <p>The Chemistry Department at Westmont College focuses on giving our students a broad, deep, and hands-on education. Our students use all of our state of the art instrumentation including an atomic absorption spectrometer, FTIR and UV-VIS spectrometers, HPLC, a mass spectrometer, and a 400 MHz high performance digital nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system. Our faculty members are professionally active, and students have the opportunity to work individually with faculty members on independent research. The research often leads to student co-authored publications in chemistry journals. Many of our graduates have gone on to the top graduate schools and medical schools in the country.</p>

     <h2>Communication Studies</h2> 
     <p>The Communication Studies major helps students understand how messages work in relationships and in the larger culture. Students study how influence occurs, how leadership emerges in groups, the importance of understanding context, and the effects of the media. Though students have opportunities to improve their speaking, the focus of the major is more on learning to be a shrewd and appreciative critic of communication events. By developing a biblically informed communication lens, graduates are prepared to enter careers ranging from marketing and public relations to counseling and law.</p>

     <p>A major in computer science prepares you for the best jobs, based on studies that consider salary, work environment, and opportunity. There are many more jobs in computer science than graduates, both now and in the foreseeable future. Computer science involves solving problems to meet human needs. It requires teamwork, creativity and logical thinking.</p> 
     <p>The Computer Science program at Westmont features close faculty-student interactions and mentoring, small class sizes, opportunities for research, and state of the art facilities. Students and faculty enjoy a strong sense of community encouraged by regular department dinners and movie nights.</p>

     <h2>Education</h2> 
     <p>The Education Department offers state-approved credential programs for both elementary and secondary teachers. Prospective elementary teachers typically complete the Liberal Studies major administered by the department. Prospective secondary teachers major in the field they wish to teach. Careful personal advising, individually-selected mentors in the schools, and field supervision by experienced full-time faculty all contribute to a thoroughly professional, highly practical preparation for teaching. With careful planning, early deciders can complete the bachelors degree and the credential program in four years. Candidates may complete Student Teaching requirements in Santa Barbara or through our partner school in Costa Rica.</p>

     <h2>Engineering Physics</h2> 
     <p>The rapid growth of scientific knowledge and its applications has generated a large demand for men and women well trained in physics and engineering. Physicists seek a fundamental understanding of the physical universe. Engineers apply scientific knowledge to design and develop structures, machines, and products. Students may pursue the engineering physics major with an emphasis in either area. The physics emphasis stresses fundamental science and mathematics essential for graduate study or professional work in physics.

     <h2>English</h2> 
     <p>The English Department offers a literature-based major with concentrations in literature or writing, with extended graduate and teacher prep tracks. At 36 units, the general major doubles easily with many other majors. A third of the major may be fulfilled on the Department's beloved England Semester (off-campus semester long program). The literature concentration focuses primarily on British, American and world Anglophone literature; the writing concentration combines literary study with options in journalism, creative writing, film analysis, screenwriting, student publications and advanced composition. Students may fulfill major requirements with internships, tutorials, seminars, and major honors projects. A lively Literary Society is entirely student-led.</p>

     <h2>European Studies</h2> 
     <p>The European Studies major is designed to allow students to combine an interest in modern languages with an interdisciplinary exploration of culture and history. Using demonstrated competence in French, German or Spanish as a foundation, students will undertake coursework in the humanities and social sciences in order to develop an understanding of and appreciation for the complexities of a given European (culture/nation/region) and its place on the world stage. The major is supervised by faculty drawn from the departments of Art History, French, Economics and Business, German, Spanish, History, and Political Science. </p>

     <h2>French</h2> 
     <p>The French major combines the experience of living and studying in a foreign country with that of the residential liberal arts college. French majors may choose either fall or spring semester, usually in their junior year, to take a full course of study (14-16 units) at an approved university in a region where French is the native language. Course offerings vary from year to year and from university to university, but always include language, literature, and civilization and culture classes. Close student-faculty relationships, small class sizes, excellent language materials, and flexibility in the curriculum all contribute to meet students' needs in studying French.</p>

     <p>The social science major applies the methodology of science to our behavior as individuals and in groups. The social sciences share the search for general characteristics or patterns of human behavior rather than a concern for particular persons or institutions. Each of the four social sciences—history, political science, sociology, and economics—brings its own set of questions and offers a different arena of human activity for observation and experiment. Social science majors will learn how human beings function in community, how they organize to accomplish common goals, how they manage the production and exchange of goods and services, and how they can live together and promote the work of the Kingdom of God.</p>
