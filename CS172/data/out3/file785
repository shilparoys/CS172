Charter members who are not new initiates had their Phi Kappa Phi affiliation at another institution changed to the Alfred State chapter Thursday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers are Tomasi (president), Enke (vice president), Greil (secretary), McGee (treasurer), Pollard (scholarship and awards officer), and Schwartz (public relations officer).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomasi, who was installed as honor society president by Dr. Rick Shale, professor of English at Youngstown State University, said, “Today we celebrate excellence. We gather to initiate worthy individuals into the honor society of Phi Kappa Phi. These persons have been chosen on a basis of their superior scholarship and we are pleased and proud that each has chosen to become part of a century-old community of scholars and professionals that includes individuals who have distinguished themselves in positions of leadership and whose careers have been characterized by achievement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1897&amp;nbsp;at the University of Maine, according to &lt;a href="http://www.phikappaphi.org" target="_blank"&gt;www.phikappaphi.org&lt;/a&gt;, Phi Kappa Phi is the nation’s oldest and most selective collegiate honor society for all academic disciplines. It has chapters on more than 300 campuses in the United States and the Philippines. Each year, around 30,000 members are initiated, and only the top 10 percent of a graduating class and the top 7.5 percent of juniors are invited to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alfred State, according to Tezak, will initiate eligible students into the honor society for the first time in a ceremony that will take place in April at a date to be determined. Tezak said he has worked on forming a Phi Kappa Phi chapter at the college for the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the honor society is interdisciplinary, it is ideally suited to Alfred State,” he said.&amp;nbsp;“Membership is an academic recognition that will follow our students throughout their lifetime. It is an honor well-earned.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Phi Kappa Phi, other honor societies at Alfred State include Chi Alpha Epsilon, Phi Theta Kappa, Psi-Beta, Sigma Tau Epsilon, and Tau Alpha Pi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In photo above:&lt;/strong&gt; Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Technology Associate Professor Christopher Tomasi, left, is installed as president of the Alfred State chapter of the Phi Kappa Phi honor society Thursday by Dr. Rick Shale, professor of English at Youngstown State University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The article is titled “The Galactic Adventures of Doc Smith.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Elmer Smith (1890-1965), also known as Doc Smith, was a pioneer in the early days of science fiction writing. He penned the popular “Lensman” and “Skylark” series of books. The space operas created by Smith typically involve sophisticated technology and thrilling adventures that take place in outer space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author notes that Smith earned a doctorate in chemical engineering from George Washington University in 1919 and worked as a food chemist for several corporations. He also conducted research studies for the United States Army from 1941 to 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith was a writer of great creativity and his themes involve stranded spaceships, killer robots, time travel, and mental telepathy. His tales of science fiction inspired generations of youngsters to learn more about chemistry, physics, and astronomy. Smith's belief that scientific knowledge would lead to a better world is incorporated into all of his writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kellogg frequently writes about the literary genres of mystery fiction and science fiction. He is the author of a series of illustrated books for children featuring boy detective Barry Baskerville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

     <title>Alfred State New Horizons Forum to present ‘Meet the Candidates’ evening</title>

       &lt;span class="field-label"&gt;Posted Date:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-02-17T08:30:00-05:00"&gt;Tuesday, February 17, 2015 - 08:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Alfred State New Horizons Forum continues its 2014-2015 season with a special event on the upcoming Alfred village elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Meet the Candidates” forum will be offered to the entire Alfred community on Thursday, Feb. 26, from 5:30-7:30 p.m. in room 215 of the School of Engineering Technologies Building. Campus signage and volunteers will direct the public to the nearest parking areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forum Director SUNY Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus Joe Flynn has recently invited participation from Alfred village mayoral candidates Justin Grigg and Jason Rodd, and trustee candidates Peter McClain, Kory Schick, Thomas McDowell, and Nick Ferraro. The forum letter specifies that the program will consist of two information sessions followed by a reception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Session I is for the four trustee candidates. Doors will close at the start of each session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format rules provide equal speaking time for each candidate. The session starts with opening statements, followed by brief candidate responses to written questions from the audience. The questions are to be directed to the office being sought, not an individual candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Session I will close with two-minute closing statements, for a total running time of under 45 minutes. After a short intermission, Session II for the two mayoral candidates will be governed by similar format rules with opening statements of six minutes, responses to written questions, and closing statements of four minutes. Session II is timed to end in under 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With candidate concurrence, the entire event will be broadcast over WETD and recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A community reception with the candidates will follow in the gallery area outside SET 215. An information table for signed campaign and voter education materials will be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Horizons Forum, sponsored by the School of Arts and Sciences, showcases current scholarly, creative, and public service work by faculty, students, professional staff, and invited guests. It is guided by a campus-wide team of advisers who represent lead faculty, administrators, professional staff of the three academic schools, student affairs, and student government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key goals of the forum include practical efforts to encourage active learning outside the classroom, community service, and to sponsor activities that will enrich the intellectual life of the institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “Meet the Candidates” forum is a joint effort of New Horizons, the Office of Civic Engagement, Student Civic Engagement Advocates, the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and many individual volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

     <title>New Pioneer Woodsmen’s Club Barn celebrated with ribbon-cutting ceremony</title>

According to Alfred State Police Lt. Scott Bingham, club adviser, the 850-square-foot building was renovated this summer for $10,000, and was completed in September. It now serves as the location for the club’s saw mill, and is being utilized for practicing certain timber sports disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We purchased the new saw mill two years ago and have been bouncing it all over campus trying to keep it protected from the elements. Also, the club competes year-round and with New York’s weather, it’s not feasible to train outdoors in the winter months or even in the warmer weather with rain,” Bingham said as to the purpose of renovating the barn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sullivan, who gave the opening remarks, thanked the Facilities Services employees who worked on the renovations and he also thanked the club members for being active and engaged students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our clubs and organizations are very important to Alfred State and this one is as well,” Sullivan said. “It’s one of our fastest-growing clubs thanks to its leadership, and we expect it to continue to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chad Martin, club president and a construction management engineering technology major from Breesport, provided a student perspective on the new Pioneer Woodsmen’s Club Barn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the past few years, we’ve had to mill wood outside during rain, during snow, and to be inside away from all of that is huge,” Martin said. “The Woodsmen’s Club is a family to us. We’re a small-knit group. Everybody’s got everybody’s back. It’s a little different than a sports team, but we compete as a sports team. I’m just saying, for everybody else, that this is our home away from home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the club was formed five years ago, Bingham said, the group was practicing on the top of a nearby water tower hill with equipment he had left over from his days of professional competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I stored the equipment in the police department and in personnel vehicles. The club bounced around for a couple years, but with the college’s support, we are now one of the top-ranked collegiate timber sports teams in the Northeast and Canada, we have our own heated garage, and now an enclosed barn large enough to run a saw mill in,” Bingham said. “We have some very competitive equipment and are doing better every day. Our club still has some room for improvements and advancements, but we are making great strides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bingham said the barn is a great addition to the club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We utilized a partially erected structure that was going to just deteriorate if it wasn’t utilized,” Bingham said. “So, we saved some materials and got a barn to put our saw mill in at a very affordable price. This barn has rooted us behind the Veterinary Technology Center as the Woodsmen’s Club’s home, whereas previously we were nomadic, afraid to set our roots and develop an area for our specific needs. Now we can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In photo above:&lt;/strong&gt; Alfred State President Dr. Skip Sullivan uses a chainsaw Wednesday to cut the wooden “ribbon” at a ceremony to celebrate the new Pioneer Woodsmen’s Club Barn.

Van Otterloo, who holds a degree in studio art from Houghton College, works from her naturally lit studio, where she paints a variety of subjects, including still life, flowers, plants, and landscapes in both oils and watercolors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her artist statement on her website, &lt;a href="http://www.bridgetbossartvanotterloo.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.bridgetbossartvanotterloo.com&lt;/a&gt;, van Otterloo says her work has been influenced by Italian and Spanish still life painters and that her paintings are about the beauty in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe that the beauty found in nature enriches our existence,” she says on her website. “Natural forms, elegant lines, bold colors, and the intrinsic details found in nature are the themes in my work. My most recent paintings explore the interaction between humans and the natural world. Nature is incredibly resilient as it continues to persevere in the face of man-made threats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An active participant in the Corning art community, van Otterloo has taught art classes at area youth centers, museums, and Corning Community College, and currently teaches watercolor and oil painting classes at 171 Cedar Arts Center in Corning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit will be open for viewing during normal library hours. To inquire about exhibiting your work in the Hinkle Gallery, email &lt;a href="mailto:library@alfredstate.edu"&gt;library@alfredstate.edu&lt;/a&gt; or call 607-587-4313.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

       &lt;span class="field-label"&gt;Posted Date:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-01-30T15:00:00-05:00"&gt;Friday, January 30, 2015 - 15:00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several members of the Alfred State family were honored for their service to others Thursday at the Alfred Village Hall during the fifth annual Celebration of Service Ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, two honorees, one student and one faculty or staff member, receives a Spirit of Service Award, which recognizes and celebrates those in the Greater Alfred community who demonstrate a strong commitment to serving others. The award is intended to honor people who are actively living out the principles Martin Luther King Jr. stood for, including equality, social justice, community, and service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/downloads/Ashley%20Ebel%20and%20award.jpg" alt="Ashley Ebel, a business administration major from Freeville, proudly displays her Alfred State College Student Spirit of Service Award." title="Ashley Ebel, a business administration major from Freeville, proudly displays her Alfred State College Student Spirit of Service Award." width="288" height="322" style="float: right;"&gt;Ashley Ebel, a business administration major from Freeville, was named this year’s Alfred State College Student Spirit of Service Award winner. Ebel works as a student advocate for the Center for Civic Engagement, works at the rock climbing wall, is a leader in the Outdoor Recreation Club, and is president of Little Angels of Honduras, a new organization on campus devoted to fundraising and awareness regarding the lack of adequate medical supplies and care for Honduran infants and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Ebel was named “Mentee of the Year” for the Emerging Pioneers Leadership Program, in part due to her hard work with Hope for Honduras. She has also worked with a small group through this leadership program to raise awareness about youth suicide by hosting a poetry slam. This event highlighted many of the reasons for young adult suicide and discussed resources available to depressed and suicidal youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s winner of the Alfred State Faculty/Staff Spirit of Service Award is Michael Murray, assistant director of dining at Auxiliary Campus Enterprises and Services, Inc. (ACES). ACES is a not-for-profit corporation that supports the mission of Alfred State by providing dining services, campus bookstores, cable TV, vending, and transportation services to student customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray has been a member of the Alfred State Family for decades as a tireless employee of ACES, is an active member of the Alumni Board, is co-adviser to the Greek Advisory Board, and is an adviser to one of Alfred State’s Greek houses, Gamma Theta Gamma. Every year under Murray's direction, the brothers of Gamma Theta Gamma host a Halloween Haunted House for the community, with proceeds typically going to Relay for Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, half of the proceeds from this event went to benefit the Golisano Children's Hospital, and under Murray’s direction, the fraternity is working to raise money and awareness for the Wounded Warrior Project. Murray is also an active fundraiser for the ALS Foundation, participating in the annual Golf Tournament Fundraiser and continuing to raise money and awareness for the cause throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also recognized were the following nominees, who each received a certificate for their efforts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andrew Scott, an architectural technology major from Arverne, who has devoted significant time outside of his architectural studies to volunteer at the Southern Tier Architectural Resource (STAR) Center.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chad Martin, a construction management engineering technology major from Breesport, who,as president of the Pioneer Woodsmen’s Club, takes leadership in managing a large and active club involved in lumberjacking competitions throughout the region.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Robert Curry, dean ofthe School of Arts and Sciences, who is a language partner for international students, has served on many Alfred State committees, serves on various New York State curricular committees, and always makes time for staff and students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debra Mayes, computer specialist with technology services, whois highly engaged in numerous civic engagement projects and has traveled to Catskills, North Dakota, Long Island, and Detroit to assist with flood cleanup and other disaster relief efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barbara Pierce,student activities secretary,who is an incredible advocate for the Alfred Community Garden and has mentored a group of students who are participants of the Emerging Pioneers Leadership Program at Alfred State.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/downloads/Michael%20Murray.jpg" alt="Michael Murray, assistant director of dining at Auxiliary Campus Enterprises and Services, Inc.
