         <h2>Human Rights Policy</h2>
        </header>
        <p></p> 
        <p>Discrimination and harassment, including acts based on race, religion, disability, age, national origin, and other identified protected classes are prohibited under state and federal law, as well as under Drew University’s Human Rights Policy. This Policy embodies Drew’s commitment to creating and maintaining a diverse and open educational community. It is intended to educate the community about discrimination and harassment and to support and protect any member of the community who uses this Policy responsibly to pursue a complaint. Drew will investigate, adjudicate, and remedy reports of violations of the Policy.</p> 
        <p>The Human Rights Policy and its Procedures have been amended and restructured to address new requirements under federal, law designed to address domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault.&nbsp; As result of those changes, Drew has adopted a Sexual Harassment and Misconduct Policy to separately address sexual discrimination and harassment.The revised Policy will be implemented in the 2014 Fall term.&nbsp; Comments, questions, and feedback are welcomed.</p> 
        <p>Drew University is committed to maintaining and supporting diversity throughout the Drew community.&nbsp; Discrimination or harassment in education or employment on the basis of protected class status constitutes a violation of this policy.&nbsp; Protected class status is based on race, creed (religion), color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, sex, gender identity or expression, disability, familial status, military service obligation, or nationality.&nbsp; Offensive or unwelcome conduct or repeated differential treatment, as defined in this policy, based upon protected characteristics, is prohibited.&nbsp; Gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment will, however, be addressed under the Sexual Harassment and Misconduct Policy.</p> 
        <p>Each member of the University community is expressly prohibited from verbal, physical, written, or other technology-based conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or learning environment based on identified protected class characteristics that is sufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to unreasonably interfere education or employment.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2> 
        <p>The purpose of the Drew University Human Rights Policy is to provide all members of the University community equal educational and employment opportunity, access, and benefits in an environment free from harassment and discrimination.&nbsp; The policy seeks to protect anatmosphere of trust and collegialitywithin the University community and to educate the members of the community on their responsibilities.&nbsp; Under this policy, the University will initiate a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation of any report of protected class discrimination or harassment and will provide effective and reliable processes and procedures for seeking remedies, while affording those accused of violations a fair opportunity to be heard.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Scope of the Policy</strong></h2> 
        <p>The Drew University Human Rights Policy applies to members of the University community, including students, faculty, staff, and University officials.&nbsp; Discrimination or harassment, based on protected class status, even if it occurs off campus, can create a hostile environment and is prohibited under this policy.</p> 
        <p>Visitors, alumni/ae, guests, vendors, and contractors, who violate this Policy may be referred for criminal prosecution, be required to leave University property and/or banned from the campus and from participating in future activities.&nbsp; Hosts, including students or employees, or other individuals directly affiliated with the Drew community, are subject to this Policy and may be held responsible for the actions of their visitors or guests.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Definitions</strong></h2> 
        <h3><strong>1. Discrimination</strong></h3> 
        <p>Discrimination is any distinction, preference, advantage for or detriment to an individual, when compared to others, that is based on any protected class status as defined under this Policy.&nbsp; The discrimination must be&nbsp; sufficiently severe, pervasive and objectively offensive to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or educational environment, or otherwise unreasonably interfere with or limit a student’s or employee’s ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s educational programs, activities, or work.</p> 
        <h3><strong>2. Harassment</strong></h3> 
        <p>Discriminatory harassment is verbal or physical conduct that demeans or shows hostility, or aversion, toward an individual because of his/her protected class status.&nbsp;&nbsp;Harassing conduct consists of a range of behaviors that a reasonable person would consider sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, or objectively offensive working or educational environment.&nbsp; It can include epithets, slurs, jokes, negative stereotyping or threatening, intimidating or hostile acts that relate to a person’s protected class status.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harassment can be communicated through spoken words, physical actions, written or graphic material, or electronic or social media.</p> 
        <h3><strong>3. Hostile Environment Harassment/Misconduct</strong></h3> 
        <p>Hostile environment harassment/misconduct is sufficiently severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to unreasonably interfere with or limit another’s ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s education program or workplace. Most often such behaviors constitute harassment based on protected class status when they are frequent and repeated or when they continue after someone has asked that they stop.&nbsp; The more severe the conduct, the less need there is to show a repetitive series of incidents.</p> 
        <p>Verbal misconduct consists of verbal comments, including humor or derogatory comments, directed at an individual or group, as well as comments made via phone, text message, e-mail, electronic posting, or other electronic media.&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes that&nbsp;continue after a request to stop, and/or are unwelcome, and which unreasonably interfere with a student’s or employee’s ability to benefit from or participate equally in the University’s programs or work.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Retaliation</strong></h2> 
        <p>Drew University’s Human Rights Policy seeks to encourage students, staff, and faculty to express freely and responsibly their opinions and feelings about any complaint of discrimination or harassment. Any act of reprisal, interference, restraint, penalty, discrimination, coercion, or harassment — overtly or covertly – against a person who uses this policy and its procedures not only undermines the University’s atmosphere of trust and collegiality, but threatens its ability to conduct investigations and to address violations. Retaliation includes any threats or other form of intimidation directed at a complainant, a witness, or a supporter at any point before, during or after an investigation, mediation and/or hearing. Accordingly, such acts violate this Policy and will be subject to appropriate and prompt disciplinary action.</p> 
        <h2><strong>False Complaints</strong></h2> 
        <p>This Policy shall not be used to bring frivolous or malicious charges against students, faculty or staff members. Discipline under the appropriate University policy may be taken against any person knowingly bringing a false complaint of any form of discrimination</p> 
        <h2><strong>Multiple or Related Complaints</strong></h2> 
        <p>Where the same facts or circumstances involve violations of different aspects of the Human Rights policy, all related complaints against a person will be addressed, heard, and resolved in one forum and proceeding. Complaints alleging violations of this policy cannot be pursued in multiple forums or on a serial basis when the same facts and circumstances are involved. In the event that a proceeding under this Policy also involves claims under another University policy or forum, the appropriate administrator shall determine which policy or forum has a predominant interest. All related violations are to be considered in the proceeding selected, based on the constituency of the person complained against.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Free Academic Inquiry</strong></h2> 
        <p>Academic freedom is central to the University’s mission.&nbsp; This policy is not intended to restrict free academic inquiry, educational purpose, or artistic expression.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Cooperation</strong></h2> 
        <p>All members of the campus community should cooperate in an inquiry, investigation, and complaint resolution processes as required to ensure a prompt, adequate, reliable and impartial investigation of complaints.&nbsp; Fact finders are authorized to call upon any administrative subdivision of the University or employee or staff member for assistance as necessary to complete its investigation and/or may utilize external resources to conduct any aspect of the investigation as necessary.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Privacy</strong></h2> 
        <p>All proceedings, documents, activities and meetings related to a specific investigation and/or complaint are considered private, as permitted by this Policy or applicable law.&nbsp; While privacy will be maintained to the extent possible, the University cannot commit to privacy on an across the board basis.&nbsp; The University will use its best efforts not to disseminate information about an investigation or complaint beyond those who have a need to know.&nbsp; Consistent with its obligations under state and federal law, however, the University may be required to take reasonable investigative steps, even in the face of a request for privacy or a request not to pursue an investigation.</p> 
        <p>Parties and those interviewed in connection with a claim of discrimination or harassment should not disclose information about the report, investigation, mediation, or adjudication to those outside the process in order to avoid interference, claim of undue influence, or retaliation.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Confidentiality</strong></h2> 
        <p>Under federal law, a student’s sanction or discipline is part of the educational record of an accused student and is protected from release with certain exceptions.&nbsp; This information will be released to the complainant.</p> 
        <p>In matters involving faculty and or/staff only, both parties will be advised of the outcome and sanction of a disciplinary proceeding.&nbsp; As otherwise, as a general rule, an employee’s specific sanction will not be disclosed to persons other than supervisors.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Training &amp; Education</strong></h2> 
        <p>All members of the University community are required to familiarize themselves with the content of the Policy as well as with the procedures. Ongoing training and awareness programs, including on-line education and training will be scheduled and are currently available.&nbsp; Employees who are likely to receive reports of discrimination or harassment, including faculty, administrators, resident assistants, health and counseling personnel, and athletic staff, should ensure they receive training, be familiar with these policies and procedures, and be able to identify appropriate contacts within the University for handling reports or complaints of violations.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Notice of&nbsp;Nondiscrimination</strong></h2> 
        <p>Drew University does not discriminate in its education program and activities or employment practices on the basis of sex, race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital, civil union or domestic partnership status, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, familial status, military service obligation, disability, or nationality.&nbsp; The University complies with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other federal and State anti-discrimination laws.</p>

        <h2>Fact Finding</h2> 
        <p>Fact finding consists of an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of an allegation that the Drew University Human Rights Policy has been violated.&nbsp;Fact-finding includes efforts to identify pertinent formation, interview pertinent witnesses, and collect pertinent records. Both the complainant and the person complained against will be asked to identify potential witnesses or sources of information during fact-finding.</p> 
        <p>A report or complaint of discrimination or harassment will be initially evaluated by the AA/EEO Officer, or designee, including Campus Life and Student Affairs professional staff, and may result in a preliminary inquiry, administrative action, including interim measures, as detailed in Daniels Dictionary, or final disciplinary action, which are also detailed in Daniels Dictionary, mediation, referral for additional fact finding, referral to another more appropriate process or forum, or dismissal, when the Policy is found not to have been violated.&nbsp; Referral for additional fact finding does not constitute a determination that a complaint or report is substantiated.</p> 
        <p>Fact-finding may be placed on hold at the request of law enforcement. Initial notice of an inquiry may be provided to the person complained against during a preliminary inquiry or during any additional fact finding.&nbsp; Attorneys are not permitted to participate at any stage of the University’s fact finding, hearing, or appeal process, but may have a silent supporter drawn from the University community.&nbsp; Participants may consult with counsel on their own outside of the process.</p> 
        <h2>Summary</h2> 
        <p>At the conclusion of the fact finding process, a report or summary should be prepared and submitted to the AA/EEO Officer or designee, with a copy to Campus Life and Student Affairs. In the event of an actual conflict involving the Officer or designee and the complainant or the person complained about, an alternate shall be selected by the Vice President of Campus Life and Student Affairs.</p> 
        <h2>Dismissal</h2> 
        <p>Allegations that do not constitute a violation of the Policy, lack specificity, or that are determined to be false may be dismissed with notice to the complainant and the person complained against.&nbsp; That determination may be appealed within two days by submitting an appeal, in writing or via e-mail, to the Vice President of Finance and CFO, or designee, in the case of staff, or to the Dean, or designee, in the case of faculty.</p> 
        <p>Matters involving another University Policy or forum, with a predominant interest in the complaint and its handling, may be referred to that policy and/or forum for resolution.</p> 
        <h2>Mediation</h2> 
        <p>Mediation can be an effective means to resolve complaints. Parties can elect to pursue mediation, at any point prior to a decision, as long as it is mutually agreeable. A matter that cannot be resolved will be referred back for handling through an administrative meeting.</p> 
        <p>The written agreement will be sent to the parties, the CLSA Office and the AA/EEO Officer as soon as practicable. &nbsp;The terms and conditions of any agreement, including the nature of the complaint and the outcome should be recorded in writing and signed by the parties, and maintained by the AA/EEO Officer.</p> 
        <p>If the parties are unable to reach agreement or the complainant decides to pursue a formal hearing, that decision will be memorialized and notice provided to CLSA.</p> 
        <h2>Administrative Meetings</h2> 
        <p>Matters involving allegations of discrimination or harassment against a student will be heard administratively by a conduct officer.</p> 
        <h2>Procedures for an Administrative Meeting</h2> 
        <p>Prior to an administrative meeting, students charged with a violation of the Human Rights Policy will be requested, in writing or via e-mail, to meet with a designated conduct officer and, at that time, will be provided summary notice of any charge(s). The student complained against will be afforded, as will the complainant, an opportunity to review the fact-finding summary, including pertinent incident reports.&nbsp; The names of student witnesses without direct knowledge of the incident may be redacted.</p> 
        <p>Either student may present, for consideration by the conduct officer, additional pertinent documentation or information beyond what they provided during fact-finding to support their position. That information may consist of the identity of additional witnesses and a summary of their information, or records, documents, or other sources of pertinent information. That information should be provided at least two business days prior to the administrative meeting and must be accompanied by an explanation as to why the information was not provided during fact-finding them at also identify a reasonable basis to support any consideration of that new information.</p> 
        <p>The conduct officer will meet separately with the complainant and the person complained against in order to:</p> 
        <ol> 
         <li>Review the process as outlined below: 
          <ul> 
           <li>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss the complaint and alleged conduct, allowing the student to present his/her understanding of the events related to the incident(s).</li> 
           <li>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct the process in as timely a fashion as possible. (In cases where incidents occur near the end of a semester, the case may need to be adjudicated at&nbsp; a later point in time or via phone or other remote technology, including Skype a)</li> 
           <li>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permit the student to be accompanied by a silent supporter drawn from the University Community</li> 
           <li>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permit the accused to speak on his/her own behalf.</li> 
           <li>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion of the process, either student may submit a written summary of their position for consideration prior to any determination. This summary must be submitted within two business days of the meeting.</li> 
          </ul> </li> 
         <li>In the event either party elects not to attend a properly noticed meeting, the process will continue and due weight will be accorded to all materials related to the absent party.</li> 
         <li>At the conclusion of the process, the conduct officer will determine an appropriate finding of either “responsible” or “not responsible” for each alleged policy violation based upon the preponderance of evidence. Prior conduct violations may be a factor in determining sanctions.</li> 
         <li>After a decision has been reached, the parties will be sent at the same time e-mails or letters summarizing the outcome, and sanctions, if permitted under privacy law. If found “responsible” it is the student’s responsibility to complete all sanctions as imposed. Failure to abide by or complete a sanction may result in additional sanctions.</li> 
         <li>In certain cases deemed appropriate by the proper authorities, information on an offense may be disclosed to individuals or to the entire University community.</li> 
        </ol> 
        <p>Decisions are reported to the AA/EEO Officer and to the parties.</p> 
        <h2>Appeals</h2> 
        <ol> 
         <li>A party may appeal a determination.&nbsp; Appeals may be granted for the following reasons only: a). Pertinent new information is available which was not known to the person appealing at the time of the original hearing, and/or b). a procedural error was made that precluded a fair and impartial hearing. Deviations from designated procedures will not be a basis for sustaining an appeal unless significant prejudice results.</li> 
         <li>Decisions following a hearing must be appealed within two (2) business days of notification of the results of such hearing. Appeals will be heard by the Vice President of Finance and CFO, or designee, or the Dean, or designee, as appropriate.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>At the conclusion of the fact finding process, a report or summary should be prepared and submitted to the AA/EEO Officer or designee, with a copy to the Human Resources Department and the Dean’s Office. In the event of an actual conflict involving the AA/EEO Officer and the complainant or the person complained about, an alternate shall be selected by the Vice President of Administration and University Relations or Dean, based on the constituency of the accused.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Dismissal</strong></h2> 
        <p>Allegations that do not constitute a violation of the Policy, lack specificity, or that are determined to be false may be dismissed with notice to the complainant and the person complained against.&nbsp; That determination may be appealed within two days by submitting an appeal, in writing or via e-mail, to the Vice President of Finance and CFO, or designee, in the case of staff, or to the Dean, or designee, in the case of faculty.</p> 
        <p>Matters involving another University Policy or forum, with a predominant interest in the complaint and its handling, may be referred to that policy and/or forum for resolution.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Mediation</strong></h2> 
        <p>Mediation can be an effective means to resolve complaints. Parties can elect to pursue mediation, at any point prior to a decision, as long as it is mutually agreeable.&nbsp; &nbsp;A matter that cannot be resolved will be referred back for handling through an administrative meeting.</p> 
        <p>The terms and conditions of any agreement, including the nature of the complaint and the outcome should be recorded in writing, signed by the parties, and maintained by the AA/EEO Officer, with copies provided to Human Resources, the Dean’s Office, and the parties, as soon as practicable.</p> 
        <p>If the parties are unable to reach agreement or the complainant decides to pursue a formal hearing, that decision will be memorialized and notice provided to CLSA.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Administrative Hearings</strong></h2> 
        <p>Matters involving allegations of discrimination or harassment, based on protected class status will be heard administratively by a hearing officer.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Procedures for an Administrative Hearing</strong></h2> 
        <p>Prior to an administrative hearing, a staff or faculty member charged with a violation of the Human Rights Policy will be provided summary notice of any charge(s) and requested, in writing or via e-mail, to meet with an administrator designated by the AA/EEO Officer. The employee complained against, as well as the complainant, will be separately afforded an opportunity to review the fact-finding summary, including pertinent incident reports.&nbsp; The names of student witnesses without direct knowledge of the incident may be redacted.</p> 
        <p>Either party may present, for consideration by the designated hearing officer, additional pertinent documentation or information beyond what they provided during fact-finding to support their position. That information may consist of the identity of additional witnesses and the substance of their information, or records, documents, or other sources of pertinent information. That information should be provided at least two business days prior to the administrative meeting and must be accompanied by an explanation as to why the information was not provided during fact-finding them at also identify a reasonable basis to support any consideration of that new information. The hearing officer will meet separately with the complainant and the person complained against in order to:</p> 
        <ol start="2"> 
         <li>Review the process as outlined below: 
          <ul> 
           <li>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss the complaint and alleged conduct, allowing the party to present his/her understanding of the events related to the incident(s).</li> 
           <li>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct the process in as timely a fashion as possible.</li> 
           <li>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permit the party to be accompanied by a silent supporter drawn from the University Community</li> 
           <li>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permit the complainant and the person complained against to speak on his/her own behalf.</li> 
           <li>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion of the process, either employee may submit a written summary of their position for consideration prior to any determination. This summary must be submitted within two working days of the meeting and cannot consist of new information unless that information could not have been submitted previously and that inability is reasonably demonstrated.</li> 
          </ul> </li> 
         <li>In the event either party elects not to attend a properly noticed meeting, the process will continue and due weight will be accorded to all materials related to the absent party.</li> 
         <li>At the conclusion of the meetings process, the hearing officer will determine an appropriate finding of either “responsible” or “not responsible” for each alleged policy violation based upon the preponderance of evidence.</li> 
         <li>After a decision has been reached, an outcome decision letter or e-mail will be forwarded to both parties, at the same time. The person complained against will also receive notice of the sanctions. Prior conduct violations may be a factor in determining sanctions.</li> 
         <li>If found “responsible” it is the employee’s responsibility to complete all sanctions as imposed. Failure to abide by or complete a sanction may result in additional sanctions.</li> 
         <li>In certain cases, as permitted under federal law, information regarding an offense may be disclosed to individuals or to the entire University community.</li> 
        </ol> 
        <p>Decisions are reported to the AA/EEO Officer, the Human Resources Department and/or the Dean’s Office.</p> 
        <h2><strong>Appeals</strong></h2> 
        <ol> 
         <li>A party may appeal a determination.&nbsp; Appeals may be granted for the following reasons only: a). Pertinent new information is available which was not known to the person appealing at the time of the original hearing, and/or b). a procedural error was made that precluded a fair and impartial hearing. Deviations from designated procedures will not be a basis for sustaining an appeal unless significant prejudice results.</li> 
         <li>Decisions following a hearing must be appealed within two (2) business days of notification of the results of such hearing. Appeals will be heard by the Vice President of Finance and CFO, or designee, or the Dean, or designee, as appropriate.</li> 
         <li>Only one appeal is allowed.</li> 
        </ol>
