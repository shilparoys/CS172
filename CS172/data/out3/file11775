                 <td> <p><strong>A Statement of Character</strong></p> <p>The Caspersen School is an integral part of Drew University. The concept of a university derives from “universe,” which implies a turning around one point. The image may be that of a wheel and its hub. The universe of our discourse centers upon a deep, close inquiry into the inmost nature of human understanding and creativity. Sometimes expressed in literature or liturgy, often expressed in intellectual history, or theology, our inquiry is basically interdisciplinary. In a shorthand manner we speak of our being devoted to advanced studies in aspects of the Humanities.</p> <p>Once characterized as “the greatest of all keys to the history, mind and thoughts of civilization,” the Humanities are identified in the Caspersen School by reference to interdisciplinary inquiry. In this way we are free to engage in open discourse as a small community of scholars some of whose fields are too often divorced from the Humanities per se. Thus, we do seek to define the Humanities by appeal not to exclusion but to inclusion. What the hub of our inquiry includes, we welcome.</p> <p>In another sense we practice inclusion by inviting into the Caspersen School students and faculty of widely diverging points of view. We respect diversity not as virtuous in and of itself but as essential to the unfolding of our common task, for the hub of our experience is both an idea and a task.</p> <p>We are dedicated to providing graduate education of world class quality. Therefore our admissions policy is highly selective. We seek talented students from many nations who are knowledgeable about their convictions, creative and self-disciplined, and who relish the opportunity for untrammeled intellectual adventure.</p> <p>We look upon our common task as both descriptive and therapeutic. We are constantly concerned with facts without neglecting the pursuit of meaning in a global context. We revere knowledge for its own sake, yet our mission leads us to the pursuit of wisdom and the common good.</p> <p><strong>I. Degree Courses of Study and Requirements</strong></p>

                  <ol> 
                   <li>Annually in the fall the Deans with the advice of the Dean’s Council will determine how many students should be admitted to each program. The Council will be guided by: 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>The recommendation of the Faculty in each Area as submitted to the Dean’s Council.</li> 
                     <li>The judgment of the Dean’s Council as to where each program stands in its development toward some optimum condition. It might be desirable, for example, to encourage the growth of some programs while holding or even reducing others.</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li><strong>Notification</strong><br> All applicants whose folders are complete by the programs admission application deadline shall be assured of prompt notification. Financial Aid and Scholarship decisions should be made to coincide with the letters of notification as closely as possible.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Language</strong><br> All international applicants and non-native speakers of English must submit TOEFL and TWE scores. Applicants must achieve a score of 585 on the TOEFL.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Unclassified admission</strong><br> “Special or Unclassified student status” refers to a non-matriculated student who may enroll in up to two courses, paying fees and tuition. (Special refers to Arts &amp; Letters and Medical Humanities courses, and Unclassified refers to M.A./Ph.D. courses.) The student is required to complete all of the course requirements and will be awarded a grade and a transcript for graduate credit. Special or Unclassified student status does not imply admission to the Caspersen School. Students must apply through the Admissions Office to be granted admission to Special or Unclassified status. Should they wish to matriculate in the future, they are required to apply to the degree program just as any other applicant would. If a Special or Unclassified student is admitted to a matriculated program, there is no guarantee of advanced standing for credits previously earned to count in the degree program.</li> 
                   <li><a name="gre"></a><strong>Graduate Record Exam (GRE) [M.A. &amp; Ph.D. only]&nbsp;</strong>The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test is required of all students who are native English speakers and who are applying from within the U.S. and Canada.</li> 
                   <li><a name="reinstatement"></a><strong>Reinstatement/Readmission Policy</strong><br> If fewer than five years have elapsed since withdrawal and the student was in good standing at the time of withdrawal, a student may petition the Dean for reinstatement. If there are any questions concerning the student’s status, the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum will be consulted and the student will be asked to submit a letter that should be clear in discussing previous academic work, future plans, and the basis for successfully completing the program. The Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum may or may not grant credit for the previous work, depending on grades.</li>

Such approval may depend on submission of evidence that the circumstances that necessitated less than full-time study have changed, enabling the student to devote him/herself to a full-time schedule of study.&nbsp;<a name="visa"></a>The visa status of international students may be affected by such classification, as may the deferment of required repayment on federal student loans. For part-time students, completion of course work will be considered equivalent to two years of full-time status (which will allow them five additional years to complete the program).</li> 
                       <li>Students who have been full-time while taking course work may be considered to be full-time students for a maximum of two semesters while they maintain matriculation in preparation for capstone essays. A student failing the capstone essays, in whole or in part, may be considered a full-time student for two additional semesters upon approval of the Dean. Students who have been less than full-time during course work will retain the same status as they maintain matriculation, unless a change of status is approved by the Dean. Such approval could follow on submission of evidence that the circumstances that necessitated less than full-time study have changed, enabling the student to devote him/herself to a full-time schedule of study. A student who has completed comprehensive essays may register for up to two semesters of dissertation prospectus preparation with signature of a Dean.</li> 
                       <li>Ph.D. candidates who have completed the dissertation year may be considered full-time students for two additional semesters upon presentation of a satisfactory plan of study to the Dean. Such a plan should contain a schedule of work on the dissertation warranting full-time status and should be approved by the first reader on the student’s committee. Students who have not maintained matriculation for more than two semesters under the conditions listed in IV.B.3.b. above may apply for a second year of full-time status upon submission of a satisfactory plan of study for that year. Such a plan must include a narrative of the progress made during the first year and must be certified by the first reader. A student who has not been in full-time status following the dissertation year may subsequently be granted full-time status upon presentation of a satisfactory plan of study approved by the first reader. Such students must also demonstrate to the Dean that the circumstances requiring less than full-time study have changed so as to make full-time status possible. All other students who have completed the dissertation year will be classified as part-time.</li>

                   <li><strong>The standing committees</strong> 
                    <ul> 
                     <li><a name="academic_standing_committee"></a><u>Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum</u><br> The Committee shall maintain an overview of the curriculum, approve new courses, receive notice of tutorials approved by the Areas, review and approve subjects for capstone essays, receive reports on examinations from Areas with power to approve or disapprove, receive and ratify the recommendations of Areas pertaining to advanced standing, review those prospectuses of Ph.D. dissertations which have been acted upon by an Area, deal with petitions for extensions of time beyond seven (7) years for the doctoral and five (5) for the master’s degrees, review all requests for grade changes, and approve all language examination substitutions. All Areas shall be represented in committee membership, if practicable, which shall also include a chair, one student, the Dean, Associate Dean and Registrar, all of whom vote.</li> 
                     <li><a name="policy_planning_faculty"></a><u>Dean’s Council</u><br> The Committee shall propose to the Faculty general educational policy (both by direction of the Faculty and on its own initiative) and will develop long-range planning for the Caspersen School. It will also consider policy questions referred to it by other committees. In the interim between stated meetings of the Faculty, the committee may act for the Faculty in matters of administration and policy, reporting its actions to the Faculty, and reserving to the Faculty any decision that it considers to be of major importance. The committee may advise the Dean concerning all appointments to the faculty. It shall have the prerogative of nominating for election to the Faculty persons belonging to other faculties of the University, and it has the power to elect to the Caspersen School Faculty any new appointees to the University whose qualifications meet the needs of the Caspersen School.&nbsp;<u>Membership</u>&nbsp;shall include the Deans and all Area conveners; Caspersen School Administrators, the Director of the Library, the Director of Graduate Admissions, the Director of Financial Assistance, and the Registrar,&nbsp;<u>ex-officio</u>, with voice but without vote; and one student, chosen by the Graduate Students Association, who has every privilege of the committee except voting on faculty nominations and elections. The chair of the GDR will be invited to attend meetings as a non-voting member when appropriate.</li> 
                     <li><a name="faculty_committee"></a><u>Committee on Faculty</u><br> The Committee on Faculty will deal with all issues pertaining to promotion, tenure and faculty accountability. It shall consist of all Area Conveners and the Chair of Policy and Planning as voting members, unless a Convener is not tenured. The Dean and Associate Dean of the Caspersen School will be members with voice but not vote. The Committee on Faculty shall send recommendations to the Dean of the Caspersen School pertaining to all matters affecting promotion and tenure of members of the Graduate Faculty. The Dean makes the School’s final recommendation on all such matters to the Board of Trustees.</li>

                   <li>The matter of student representation on Caspersen School committees and subcommittees is left open for consideration with the understanding that definite proposals for the inclusion of students on specific committees may be submitted as desirable.</li> 
                   <li>Students and faculty of each Area are encouraged to meet together periodically to discuss curriculum and other matters of concern. Students are also encouraged to initiate such conversations.</li> 
                   <li>Student representation at faculty meetings: 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>Three student representatives—one the Convener of the GSA, the other two elected annually for one-year terms by the GSA—may participate in the meetings of the Graduate Faculty, with voice but not vote.</li> 
                     <li>Executive Session: When the Faculty deems it desirable in order to consider items of a confidential nature, it may, by a simple majority vote, resolve itself into executive session excluding the student representatives.</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li>Student representatives serving on the Dean’s Council are expected to report matters of GSA concern regularly to the Dean’s Council.</li>

                   <li>All requirements for the Master of Arts, Master of Letters and Master of Medical Humanities degrees must be completed within a period of five (5) years.</li> 
                   <li><a name="leave_of_absence"></a>Upon written approval of the Dean, a student may take a&nbsp;<u>leave of absence</u>&nbsp;for a term not to exceed one year. In special cases, a second one-year leave may be approved by the Dean.&nbsp;<strong>Students requesting a leave of absence must contact the Dean or Associate Dean before such a request will be approved and must obtain the approval of the Associate Dean.</strong>&nbsp;The Dean of the Caspersen School is empowered to grant leaves of absence on only three bases: (1) physical illness, (2) mental or emotional illness, and (3) extreme financial difficulty. As the student pays no tuition or fees during a leave of absence, he/she is not entitled to use any of the resources of the University: library, faculty, housing, or grants-in-aid. Time spent in leaves of absence will not be counted as part of the five-year time limitation for Master’s degrees or &nbsp;the seven-year time limitation for doctoral degrees. Repayment for any student loans must begin in a leave of absence, by federal regulation.</li> 
                  </ol> <p><strong>XI. Essential Elements of Graduate Study</strong></p> <p><a name="academic_honesty"></a><u>Caspersen School Standards of Academic Honesty</u></p> <p>Standards of honesty in the academic world derive from the nature of the academic enterprise itself. Scholars use writing both to create knowledge and to record knowledge, and students are invited into the academic enterprise through an intellectual conversation that occurs primarily in writing. Through the exchange of written texts, students contribute to the academic conversation and develop their intellectual skills. Since academic dishonesty necessarily hinders such development, it cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. Accordingly, Drew University has established standards of academic integrity and procedures governing violations of them. These basic standards apply to all work done at Drew. Students are expected to study and comply with these principles as stated below.</p> <p><strong>Categories of Academic Dishonesty</strong></p> <p>The categories of academic integrity apply to information that is presented orally, in writing, the computer, in format ranging from the most informal comment to a formal research paper or a dissertation. These standards apply to source material gathered from other people, from written texts, from computer programs, from the internet, or from any other location.</p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li><strong>Plagiarism:</strong><br> Plagiarism is the act of appropriating or imitating the language, ideas, or thoughts of another and presenting them as one’s own or without proper acknowledgment. This includes submitting as one’s own a thesis, a paper, or part of a paper written by another person, whether that material was stolen, purchased, or shared freely. It also includes submitting a paper containing insufficient citation or misuse of source material.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Duplicate Submission:</strong><br> Submitting one work in identical or similar form to fulfill more than one requirement without prior approval of the relevant faculty members is a breach of academic integrity. This includes using a paper for more than one course or submitting material previously used to meet another requirement.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Cheating on Examinations:</strong><br> Cheating on examinations by copying material from another person or source or by gaining any advance knowledge of the content or topic of an examination without the permission of the instructor is another breach of academic integrity. In the case of take-home examinations, the guidelines under collaboration (below) apply; failure to follow those guidelines constitutes academic dishonesty.</li> 
                   <li><strong>False Citation:</strong><br> Listing an author, title, or page reference as the source for obtained material, when the material actually came from another source or from another location within that source, is a breach of academic integrity. This includes attributing fabricated material to a real or fictitious source.</li> 
                  </ul> <p><strong>Basic Requirements for the Acknowledging Sources</strong></p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li><strong>Quotation:</strong><br> All quotations, however short, must be identified as such. In written texts they must be placed in quotation marks or be clearly indented, and the complete source must be cited either in the text or in a footnote or endnote.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Paraphrase:</strong><br> Any borrowed material that is summarized, restated, or reworked must be cited as such, whether it is used in written or oral form. The paraphrased material must be clearly indicated by a signal phrase (including the author’s name) at the beginning and a page citation or footnote/endnote marker at the end. Students should take careful notes when reading and researching so that they properly acknowledge sources and produce them upon request. Lapse of time or substantial reworking of researched material does not eliminate the obligation to give due recognition.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong><br> If a student has collaborated with another person or group of people and used research data gathered by others or significant ideas developed in collaboration (via notes, conferences, conversations, e-mail communications, etc.) as part of a paper or assignment, the extent and nature of the contribution must be clearly indicated. Students collaborating on an assignment must give proper acknowledgment both to the extent of the collaboration and to any team member whose specific ideas or words played a significant role in the development of the thesis, the argument, or the structure of the finished work. Unless a paper or assignment is collaboratively authored (and acknowledged as such), the presentation of the ideas, the interpretation of the data, and the organization of sentences and paragraphs should be original and should differ significantly from those in the papers or assignments of others who have collaborated on the research.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Material in the Public Domain:</strong><br> While facts and concepts borrowed from a source should be properly acknowledged, certain well-known facts, proverbs, and famous quotations are regarded as in the public domain and their source need not be cited. That the First World War started in 1914 does not require citation, nor does “To be or not to be” call for citation of its exact whereabouts in Hamlet. What constitutes “public domain” varies according to discipline; if in doubt, students should consult the instructor.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Bibliography/Works Cited:</strong><br> All sources consulted in preparing a paper or assignment are to be listed in the bibliography or works cited list, unless other instructions are given. While in some disciplines works listed in the bibliography may not necessarily be directly referred to in the paper or notes, all sources included in the works cited list must appear in the paper. Simply listing a work in the bibliography or works cited list does not remove the obligation to give due recognition for specific use in the body of the paper.</li> 
                   <li><strong>Forms of Reference:</strong><br> If individual departments or instructors require that a particular style be used for quotations, footnotes, endnotes, bibliographies, etc., students should be made aware of that requirement. For most theses and dissertations, students will be asked to follow the guidelines to be found in The Chicago Manual of Style, (CMS), 16th ed. (University of Chicago Press, 2010) or the version of CMS in A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, (Turabian), 8th ed. by Kate Turabian (University of Chicago Press, 2013). Otherwise, for standard forms students may consult The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, (MLA), 7th ed. (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 2009) in the humanities, or the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 6th ed. (New York: American Psychological Association, 2010) in the social sciences.</li> 
                  </ul> <p><strong>Examples of Plagiarism</strong></p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>The following examples, from Rebecca Moore Howard’s “A Plagiarism Pentimento” (Journal of Teaching Writing, Summer 1993), are provided to help prevent any misunderstanding. Please read and analyze them carefully.<br> <strong>Source:</strong><br> Davidson, Robert. Genesis 1-11. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1973.<br> <strong>Original Wording:</strong><br> “Such ‘story myths’ are not told for their entertainment value. They provide answers to questions people ask about life, about society and about the world in which they live” (10).<br> <strong>Misuse of Source (1):</strong><br> Specifically, story myths serve as answers to questions people ask about life, about society, and about the world in which they live, not for entertainment purposes.<br> <strong>Comment:</strong><br> This is an example of plagiarism as defined in this booklet. The student copied words and phrases from the original without acknowledging their source. Although the student has rearranged some phrases and made minor stylistic changes, this version still follows the basic wording and structure of the original while the student repeats ideas as if they were his or her own.<br> <strong>Misuse of Source (2):</strong><br> Davidson explains that story myths answer questions people ask about life, about society and about the world that we live in (10).<br> <strong>Comment:</strong><br> Less obviously, this example is also classified as plagiarism. Although the student cites the source of the ideas, he or she presents Davidson’s exact words as if he or she authored them. As is often the case in such plagiarism, where the words are changed, the changes render the material less clear (shifting from “people” to “we” for example).</li> 
                  </ul> <p><strong>How to Avoid Unintentional Plagiarism</strong></p> 
                  <ul> 
                   <li>Unintentional plagiarism is also a breach of academic integrity and may be punished accordingly. Unintentional plagiarism, also known as patchwriting, occurs when students depend too heavily on textual material to make a point rather than making the point themselves and using the text to support it. The second example of plagiarism above is an example of patchwriting; it may be rewritten in several different ways:<br> <strong>Misuse of Source (2):</strong><br> Davidson explains that story myths answer questions people ask about life, about society and about the world that we live in (10). 
                    <ul> 
                     <li><strong>Rewritten with Correct Citation:</strong><br> Davidson explains that “story myths” answer “questions people ask about life, about society and about the world in which they live” (10).</li> 
                     <li><strong>Paraphrased</strong><br> As Davidson explains, the importance of “story myths” is in their relevance to the everyday lives of their readers (10).</li> 
                     <li><strong>Use of Paraphrase and Quotation in a Paragraph:</strong><br> “Story myths” are powerful because they deal with phenomena that people cannot understand in any other way. As Davidson explains, story myths have direct relevance to the everyday lives of their readers by “provid[ing] answers to questions” (10).</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li><strong>Comment:</strong><br> In the rewritten version of the plagiarized sentence (a), the student has quoted all of the words that came directly from Davidson. Although this is an acceptable sentence, obviously such extensive quotation would not be acceptable throughout a research paper. In the sample paraphrase (b), the writer has maintained and correctly cited the essential idea in Davidson’s sentence, but the articulation of that idea is original, very different from the source. This is an example of an appropriate use of source material. In the final example (c), the writer has used Davidson’s analysis to support a point he or she is making about the role of “story myths,” and combined paraphrase and quotation to show how Davidson supports the assertion. This is the most common way to use source material in academic papers.<br> Notice that in all three examples the writer introduces the source material with a signal phrase naming the author and marks the end of the use of that source material with a parenthetical page reference. Although the exact method of citation varies across the disciplines, the purpose—to mark the beginning and end of material drawn from another source—remains the same.</li>

                  <ol> 
                   <li>Breaches of academic honesty and integrity are inimical to the learner or scholar personally and are infringements of the mutual faith and trust essential to the academic enterprise.</li> 
                   <li>Examples of such breaches are: cheating on examinations or papers; misrepresenting the nature and extent of one’s research; offering work done by others as one’s own; plagiarism–employing words and/or ideas originating with others without proper acknowledgment; improperly providing information, papers or projects to others; falsifying the nature or results of one’s research.</li> 
                   <li>It is the explicit policy of the Caspersen School never to accept the same paper for more than one course without the clear, written, and prior consent of all instructors involved.</li> 
                  </ol> <p><strong>Procedures for Dealing with Academic Dishonesty</strong></p> 
                  <ol> 
                   <li>Responsibility<br> All members of the academic community, faculty and students, are obliged, by that membership, to report observed instances of presumed academic dishonesty to the Dean.</li> 
                   <li>Sanctions 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>Sanctions are provided for demonstrated breaches of academic honesty or scholarly integrity.</li> 
                     <li>Where dishonesty has been determined, sanctions may range from requiring an assignment to be redone, to automatic failure for a course, to dismissal from the University.</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li>Procedures for dealing with alleged academic dishonesty<br> The regulations of the Caspersen School provide procedures whereby instances of alleged academic dishonesty are dealt with in an orderly way with due attention to the rights of the student(s) involved. 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>When an accusation of academic dishonesty is brought, the Dean of the Caspersen School will convene and chair an Academic Integrity Committee made up of two faculty members, one member of the Graduate Faculty permanently assigned to such duty, one student appointed by the GSA, the Caspersen School Deans, and the accused student’s academic advisor or another faculty member of the accused student’s choosing.</li> 
                     <li>If any of the above are party to the case (i.e., complainant or defendant), the Dean shall arrange an appropriate replacement. When any member of the Committee believes that he or she should not hear a case because of possible conflict of interest, that member should excuse him or herself. The accused student may request that a specific faculty member or student not be asked to hear the case; this request will be honored. In either case, the Committee will be reconvened using other members from the appropriate pool.</li> 
                     <li>In all proceedings, the accused shall be permitted to make a written and/or oral statement and may be represented by a faculty member who shall not be a member of the review committee. The accused student may request, and will be granted, up to a week to prepare his or her response before being called before the Committee. In the first stage of the hearing, both the faculty member bringing the charge and the accused student will be present, and each will make an oral statement to the Committee and answer any questions. At this stage, either may ask to address the Committee without the other’s being present and will be granted the right to do so.</li> 
                     <li>The accused student and the accusing faculty member will be asked to wait outside the room while the Committee discusses the case, and either may be called back into the room to answer questions. At the end of their deliberations on the case, the Dean of the Caspersen School, the faculty members and the student will vote on the matter, while the advisor will have a voice but no vote.</li> 
                     <li>A decision of guilt or innocence will be based on a preponderance of the evidence in the case; however, other factors, such as any prior accusations or any mitigating circumstances, may be taken into account in the determination of penalty.</li> 
                     <li>In all cases, both the accused student and the faculty member bringing the charge may appeal the decision as described below.</li> 
                     <li>In instances of admitted plagiarism, the Dean is authorized to dispose of the case, without a hearing, by imposing the maximum penalty, if the student prefers to have the case resolved by such means and such terms.</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li><a name="penalties"></a>Penalties<br> The individual merits of each case are weighed by the Committee, which determines the penalty accordingly. The Committee considers the purpose of both the hearing and the penalty to be educational; penalties are determined with that in mind. 
                    <ul> 
                     <li><strong>a.</strong>&nbsp;First offense<br> (1) Course Work: maximum penalty: loss of credit for the course.<br> (2) Language examinations: maximum penalty: failure of the examination.<br> (3) Capstone essay: maximum penalty: failure of all capstone essays.<br> (4) Thesis or dissertation: maximum penalty: rejection of thesis or dissertation and this option: either dismissal or permission to submit a new topic.<br> (5) Lesser penalties require the concurrence of the instructor (in the case of a course) or the Area (in the case of capstone essays).<br> (6) Greater penalties require the concurrence of the Graduate Faculty.</li> 
                     <li><strong>b.</strong>&nbsp;Second offense: Maximum penalty: dismissal from the Caspersen School.</li> 
                     <li><strong>c.</strong>&nbsp;For course work, exams, essays, theses, and dissertations already accepted in partial fulfillment of degrees already conferred:<br> First Offense: The maximum penalty is suspension from Drew and/or the revocation of a graduate degree issued by Drew. Other penalties may include, but are not limited to, denial of some or all honors conferred by the university and loss of credit for the assignment or for the course. A letter stating the Committee’s ruling will be placed in the student’s file in the Dean of the Caspersen School’s office, where it will remain. Any such letters will be a part of the record in subsequent cases and appeals.</li>

                  </ol> <p><a name="appeals_plagarism"></a><strong>Appeal Process</strong></p> <p>Decisions of the Academic Integrity Committee may be appealed only if new evidence has been found or if the original hearing overlooked specific evidence or committed procedural errors.</p> 
                  <ol> 
                   <li>The Dean’s Council is the final appeals board for cases of academic dishonesty. The appeal, whether sought by the faculty member who brought the charge or by the accused student, must be submitted in writing. On the basis of the written appeal, the Committee may decide to hear the case or to uphold the original decision if no new evidence has been presented, if no evidence has been shown to have been overlooked, and/or if no procedural errors have been shown to have occurred. Whatever its decision, the Committee must provide reasons in writing to both parties. If the Committee agrees to hear the case, it has the right to reverse the decision of an earlier hearing.</li> 
                   <li>While the Dean of the Caspersen School will remain in attendance during such hearings, he or she will have a voice but no vote.</li> 
                   <li>When any member of the Committee believes he or she should not hear the matter under appeal because of a possible conflict of interest, that member may be excused.</li> 
                   <li>During the hearing of the appeal, the faculty member who brought the original charge will provide information and answer questions. The student may be accompanied and advised by a member of the faculty of his or her choice and will also provide information and answer questions.</li> 
                   <li>Decisions will be based on a preponderance of the evidence and will be provided in writing to both parties.</li>

                     <li>Prior to the beginning of a new semester, material concerning registration will be sent to all students. Registration is required of all candidates each semester on dates announced in the University calendar. Registration should take place normally through the online system (Treehouse). &nbsp;</li> 
                    </ul> </li> 
                   <li><a name="seminars"></a><strong>Seminars</strong><br> One half of the requirement in courses shall be seminars.</li> 
                   <li><a name="tutorials"></a><strong>Tutorials</strong><br> Normally, only one tutorial per semester shall count as one of the three full-time courses. Normally, only two tutorials are allowed in the Ph.D., D.Litt. and D.M.H. programs. 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>Procedure for securing approval for a tutorial shall be as follows: 
                      <ol> 
                       <li>The student shall file a standard petition in the Caspersen School Office, bearing the signatures of (1) the proposed instructor and (2) the student’s faculty adviser.</li> 
                       <li>The Caspersen School Office shall then forward the petition to the appropriate Area convener for action by the Area.</li> 
                       <li>The Area shall return the petition with a report of its action to the Caspersen School Office for forwarding to the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum. The ASC reserves the right to deny tutorial petitions. The review and response process takes a minimum of two weeks.</li> 
                       <li>Whenever two Areas are involved in a proposed tutorial, both must take affirmative action in order to validate the petition.</li> 
                       <li>Failure by the student to comply with this procedure at any point will mean loss of credit for the tutorial.</li>

                   <li>Appeal of grades<br> A student who believes a final course grade to be in error, unfair, or inappropriate should take the following steps: 
                    <ol> 
                     <li>The student shall first seek to resolve the matter in conversation with the instructor of the course.</li> 
                     <li>If, after conferring with the instructor of the course, the issue is still not resolved, the student should confer with the Area Convener, or with the Dean, if the course falls outside the Area or if the instructor of the course is also the Convener of the Area. If the course is within the Area and the instructor is not the Convener, the Convener may confer with the instructor or convene a meeting of the Area Faculty to consider the matter. If the instructor is also the Convener of the Area, the Dean shall confer with the instructor/convener. If deemed desirable, the Dean may convene a meeting of the Area Faculty to consider the matter, either chairing the meeting or asking a member of the Area other than the convener to chair the meeting.</li> 
                     <li>If the matter is not resolved through the Area, or the course falls outside the student’s Area, the student may appeal to the Dean with a request that the complaint be heard by the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum. The Dean can then propose that the matter be resolved by having the contested grade evaluated by an anonymous outside reader. If both parties, student and instructor, agree to this process in writing, the Dean will recruit a faculty member with competence in the subject matter of the course to read and evaluate all the assigned work of the student. The outside reader, not knowing who the student is, and not knowing the original grade, will submit a grade to the Dean. This grade, if higher than the original grade, will be considered the final grade for the course. If the submitted grade is lower than the original grade, then the original grade will stand. There is no appeal of the grade submitted by the outside reviewer. &nbsp;If the Dean deems that the matter cannot be otherwise resolved, he/she will forward the appeal to the Committee.</li> 
                     <li>No complaining instructor or student who is party to the appeal shall sit as a member of the Committee while it is hearing the appeal.</li> 
                     <li>A student appealing to the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum shall submit a written statement setting forth the reasons he/she believes the grade to be in error, unfair, or inappropriate. This statement shall be forwarded to the instructor, who shall submit a statement explaining the reasons the grade was given and why a change is not appropriate. The instructor’s statement shall be furnished to the student prior to the hearing. The Committee may require of both the instructor and the student copies of all documents it judges to be relevant to its deliberations.</li> 
                     <li>The Committee shall invite both the student and the instructor to attend the hearing. The student and the instructor may be counseled, advised, and represented before the Committee by any Drew faculty member, administrator, or student who is not a member of the Committee and who agrees to serve. Using such representation is optional.</li> 
                     <li>With the approval of the Committee, either party may invite Drew Faculty members, administrators, and/or students other than the principals to make either written or personal statements to the Committee, provided their relevance to the issue can be demonstrated in advance.</li> 
                     <li>In its conduct of the hearing and in its deliberations, the Committee shall seek to determine to what extent the issue is one of procedure in the treatment of a particular student and to what extent the issue is one of substance, i.e., the evaluation of the quality of the student’s work.</li> 
                     <li>After the hearing, the Committee, in executive session, shall determine its conclusions. 
                      <ul> 
                       <li>a. If the issue is determined to be basically procedural, the Committee will decide whether the grade has been fairly assigned. If it decides that a change should be made, it may request the Registrar to do so. The Committee’s decision shall be put in writing and copies forwarded to the Dean, the Area Convener, the student, and the professor. Should either party object to the Committee’s decision, either party may appeal to the Dean’s Council. The Dean’s Council is the final court of appeal. The Dean’s Council, meeting in Executive session, will examine written materials submitted to the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum and come to a final decision.</li> 
                       <li>b. If the issue is determined to be basically substantive, the Committee may recommend that the instructor reconsider the grade in light of considerations that the Committee sets forth or it may recommend that the Dean appoint a panel of faculty to review the student’s work and recommend a grade. In the latter instance, work of other students enrolled in the course should be included in the review, if at all possible, in order to relate the work of the student under review to the instructor’s evaluation of the work of other students in the course. Such a review panel shall communicate its decision to the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum, which will make a decision and recommend a grade to the Registrar. This decision will be reported in writing to the instructor, his/her Area Convener, the Dean, and the student. Any party to the case may appeal the decision to the Dean’s Council, which remains the final court of appeals. The Dean’s Council will examine written materials submitted to the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum and come to a final decision meeting in Executive session.</li> 
                      </ul> </li> 
                     <li>The Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum, which reviews all grade changes (except in the case of faculty changing an NR to a regular grade, which can be approved by the Registrar and the Deans), may also decide against a change recommended by an instructor. In that case, the instructor may initiate a final appeal to the Dean’s Council, which will resolve the question meeting in Executive session.</li> 
                     <li>The sequence of any appeal can be outlined as follows:<br> a. to Instructor<br> b. to Convener<br> c. to Area<br> d. review by anonymous outside reader (optional)<br> e. to Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum<br> f. to Dean’s Council</li>

Policy Governing the Retention of Student Records</strong></p> <p>To avoid any suspicion that student records have been unlawfully destroyed, the Caspersen School publishes the following schedule pertaining to the retention of student records:</p> 
                  <ol> 
                   <li>An academic folder will remain “active” until the student has been graduated or withdraws. Then it will become inactive and will be stored in the basement of S. W. Bowne for a period of an additional five years. Then it will be offered to the University Archives.</li> 
                   <li>Capstone essays will be retained for one year after their disposition by the Committee on Academic Standing and Curriculum.</li> 
                   <li>Language examinations will be retained for one month after the grades are reported to the Graduate faculty</li> 
                   <li>Proposals and prospectuses are kept in a student’s academic folder and are subject to conditions explained above.</li> 
                   <li>Admissions folders are treated as follows: The folders of students who are accepted are given to the Registrar. The folders of those who do not enroll are returned to the Admissions Office, where they are retained for three years. The folders of those who do enroll are retained by the Registrar for a period of five years. Thereafter, parts of the folder are microfilmed and retained in perpetuity. The folders of students who are rejected are retained in the Admissions Office for a period of three years.</li> 
                   <li>All documents pertinent to financial aid are kept in the office of the Director of Financial Aid for seven years.</li>

                   <li>Transcripts of Drew students and graduates are mailed to other schools or potential employers at student or alumni/ae request only when financial records are clear and no outstanding bills are owed the University.</li> 
                   <li><a name="placement_service"></a>The Caspersen School Deans’ Office runs a placement service program, which maintains dossier files for students seeking academic employment. This service acts as a third-party depository for letters of recommendation for graduate students and alumni/ae. Upon written request from the student or alumnus/a, copies of these letters will be mailed to the designated institution(s). All requests for dossier mailings must have a signature; thus e-mails are not considered “written” requests. These files are maintained indefinitely, and alumni/ae may continue to add letters of recommendation to their files during the course of their career.</li> 
                   <li>A one-time fee of $25.00 is required to open a placement file. While a student is enrolled in the Graduate School, there is no further fee for sending dossiers to hiring institutions. In addition, there is a one-year grace period following a student’s graduation during which no additional fee is charged for this service. Beyond the first year after graduation, a modest postage fee is charged for each individual mailing of the dossier.</li> 
                   <li>Students interested in learning more about the placement service and opening a file are encouraged to contact the Administrative Assistant in the Caspersen Office.</li>

Students with Disabilities</strong></p> <p>The Caspersen School of Graduate Studies at Drew University, in accord with the policies underlying Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and in compliance with the Association of Higher Education and Disability guidelines, works to ensure that reasonable accommodations are implemented for enrolled students with documented disability to function in an academic environment. The University acknowledges that the decision to self-identify is a personal matter and makes no pre-admission inquiry about a candidate’s disability.</p> <p>Upon acceptance to a degree program and a minimum of one month prior to enrollment in classes, admitted students are encouraged to discuss the nature of their disability with and to submit documentation of their disability to the Department of Educational Affairs.

                    <p><u><strong>Master of Fine Arts in Poetry and Poetry in Translation&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations</strong></u></p> 
                    <p>DEGREE COURSES OF STUDY AND REQUIREMENTS<br> A. The Master of Fine Arts in Poetry and Poetry in Translation (M.F.A.)<br> The Drew University Master of Arts in Poetry is a two-year, low-residency program<br> for poets and poet translators. We provide an intense immersion into poetry through<br> writing workshops, public readings, lectures, critical writing, and study plans<br> designed by each student with his/her mentor/poet. We offer three tracks, a track in<br> Poetry, a track in Poetry in Translation, and a combined MFA in Poetry &amp; Poetry in<br> Translation (which requires an additional semester and an additional residency). The<br> Drew MFA Program in Poetry is committed to making sure that all students, no<br> matter which track they are on, are exposed to a broad range of poets and translators.<br> The MFA in Poetry requires the completion of four semesters and five residencies<br> for a total of 64 credits. Students study the craft of poetry by writing poems,<br> studying craft, reading extensively, and writing critically. Requirements include<br> attending five residencies and at the end of each residency completing an 8-10 page<br> residency essay. During the mentorship semester students are required to send four<br> packets over the course of the semester to their mentors. Each packet must include a<br> letter and reading summary, 4-6 new poems, revisions of poems, and 2 short papers.<br> During the third mentorship semester students write one 15-20 page essay instead of<br> the shorter essays. During the fourth and final semester students complete a<br> manuscript of original poems. Their final residency includes a senior presentation<br> and a senior reading.<br> The MFA in Translation program is designed to teach students about the different<br> models and schools of translation. Students receiving the MFA in Translation will<br> translate into English. They will be expected to attend all lectures at the residency in<br> order to understand the craft elements involved in writing poetry in English. The<br> degree requires the completion of four semesters and five residencies for a total of<br> 64 credits. During the fourth semester students complete a manuscript of<br> translations. All of the requirements listed above for the MFA in Poetry are required<br> for translators.<br> The Combined MFA in Poetry and Poetry in Translation is designed for poets<br> who also want to study the art of translation. Given that many poets are, at<br> sometime, drawn to translation, both for the desire to understand and get at the heart<br> of poetry from another language, as well as to inspire and deepen their own work,<br> the study of translation is an important endeavor for any poet. The mission of the<br> Drew Program in Poetry in Translation is to bring to Drew students an awareness<br> and knowledge of poetry from all over the globe. All students will be exposed at<br> residencies to the lectures in translation as well as to guest translators. To attain the<br> combined MFA students pursue their own writing at the same time that they study<br> and practice translation. The combined degree requires that students complete five<br> semesters and six residencies for a total of 80 credits. During the fourth semester<br> students complete a manuscript of their own poems. During the fifth semester 3<br> students complete a manuscript of translations. During the course of their two years<br> students will work simultaneously on translation and original work. Their<br> requirements will be the same as above with the addition of the extra manuscript.<br> B. Students who apply to translate from one track into another are bound by the<br> regulations in force at the beginning of the semester in which they will begin the<br> new track.<br> <br> <br> <br> IV. DEFINITIONS OF STUDENT STATUS<br> <br> A. M.F.A. Candidates - MFA candidates are expected to be full-time students each<br> semester. The program involves taking 16 credits each semester. Attendance at the<br> residency and completion of each semester in good standing is required to move<br> forward in the program.<br> <br> <br> <br> .&nbsp;<br> IX. TIME LIMITS FOR EARNING EACH DEGREE<br> A. All requirements for the Master of Fine Arts in Poetry and Poetry in Translation<br> degrees must be completed within a period of three years.<br> B. Upon written approval of the Dean, a student may take a leave of absence for a term<br> not to exceed one year. In special cases, a second one-year leave may be approved<br> by the Dean. Students requesting a leave of absence must meet with the Dean<br> before such a request will be approved and must obtain the signature of the<br> Associate Dean. The Dean of the Caspersen School is empowered to grant leaves of<br> absence on only three bases: (1) physical illness, (2) mental or emotional illness,<br> and (3) extreme financial difficulty. As the student pays no tuition or fees during a<br> leave of absence, he/she is not entitled to use any of the resources of the University:<br> library, faculty, housing, or grants-in-aid. Time spent in leaves of absence will not<br> be counted as part of the three-year time limitation for the M.F.A. Repayment for<br> any student loans must begin in a leave of absence, by federal regulation<br> <br> C. Advanced Standing<br> Advanced Standing in the M.F.A. in Poetry and Poetry and Translation program will<br> be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the director of the program in<br> consultation with the Academic Standing Committee.<br> XII.

Courses dropped between January 5, 2009 and March 27, 2009 are graded W<br> (Withdrew); courses dropped after March 27, 2009 are graded F.<br> B. Satisfactory Academic Progress<br> MFA candidates do not receive grades, but rather their work is evaluated as<br> satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The progress of each student is monitored carefully by<br> the mentor and director. A written evaluation by the student‟s mentor at the mid-point<br> in the semester, and then at the end of the semester, will outline the progress as well as<br> determine whether the student has met all the requirements.<br> The student will need to have attended the residency and all of the required events,<br> including but not limited to workshops, lectures, readings, and individual meetings<br> with the mentor. A residency essay must be turned in to the director. During the<br> Mentorship semester, all four packets must be sent to the mentor with the material<br> necessary to satisfy the requirements of the semester, including but not limited to<br> poems, revisions of poems, papers, and a letter to the mentor. The mentor will decide<br> whether or not the student has made satisfactory progress and has fulfilled all<br> requirements. Should the faculty member be in doubt of a student‟s work the director<br> and faculty member will work closely to discern the best course of action.<br> <br> <br> XV.

                    <h3>Required Courses</h3> 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>All PhD and MA students are required to take the Foundation Seminar (HC 800), normally in their first semester. This seminar will introduce students to the history, methods, and philosophy of historical writing.</li> 
                     <li>All PhD and MA students must take a Research Tutorial (HC 990), normally in their final semester of course work, where each student will produce an original and publishable scholarly paper. The tutorial introduces students to primary source research and the apparatus of scholarship. Students in this tutorial work mainly independently but under faculty supervision.</li> 
                     <li>All PhD students must take at least two extradisciplinary courses taught by faculty trained in fields other than history, including (but not limited to) literature, philosophy, politics, sociology, anthropology, music, art, and religion.&nbsp; At least one extradisciplinary course should be taken in the student’s first year. A student may satisfy this requirement with courses offered in other Drew graduate programs or upper-level undergraduate courses, with the approval of his/her faculty advisor and the course instructor.</li> 
                     <li>In their third year all PhD students will participate in a noncredit Writing Workshop taught by a professional nonfiction writer, which teaches academics how to communicate topics in history and culture to a general audience.</li> 
                     <li>All PhD students should select elective courses in consultation with their advisors, with a view toward preparing for their Capstone Essays (see below).</li> 
                     <li>MA students who are planning to translate to the PhD program should select courses with a view toward fulfilling the requirements for the PhD.</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p><strong>Eligible Courses</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students may register for any course listed or crosslisted with the History and Culture program. With the approval of the faculty advisor, they may also take up to two non-crosslisted courses offered by Drew’s graduate Arts and Letters program, Graduate Division of Religion, Medical Humanities program, and undergraduate College of Liberal Arts, provided the course requirements meet History and Culture standards.&nbsp; As a rough general rule, these courses should have a reading load of about 300 pages per week (or the equivalent in poetry, music, or art classes) and an overall writing load of 30 pages total.</p> 
                    <p>Students may also take up to two Graduate Tutorials (TUTG 900), but no more than one per semester.&nbsp; When registering for TUTG 900, fill out and submit a Tutorial &nbsp;petition. (This and all other forms can be downloaded from http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms.)</p> 
                    <p>In addition to their normal course load, students may informally audit other courses, with the approval of the instructor and the faculty advisor.&nbsp; For example, some students may feel the need to fill in gaps in their basic historical knowledge by sitting in on undergraduate courses.&nbsp; In such cases no formal registration is required, and students may do as much or as little course work as they wish.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Research Tutorial</strong></p> 
                    <p>All MA and PhD students must register for the Research Tutorial (HC 990), normally in their last semester of course work.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, the student will write a publishable research paper based on primary sources that will qualify as an MA thesis.&nbsp; When registering for the Research Tutorial, the student should fill out and submit a tutorial petition (http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms).</p> 
                    <p>The student should begin the tutorial by drafting a proposal, which should include a detailed summary of the proposed research project, a preliminary thesis, a description of the methodology to be used, and a bibliography of primary and secondary sources.&nbsp; The proposal should be no more than 5 pages in length and must be approved by the instructor within the first two weeks of the semester.</p> 
                    <p>The final paper should be 30-40 pages in length. It should include a title page, endnotes (rather than footnotes), and a bibliography.&nbsp; Tables, charts, and figures are optional.&nbsp; &nbsp;Follow the <em>MLA</em><em> Handbook </em>or <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>.&nbsp; Use the Times New Roman font throughout, 10 point for endnotes, 12 point for everything else.&nbsp; Leave 1-inch margins on all four sides.&nbsp; Do not justify your right margin.&nbsp; The text must be typed double-spaced with the following exceptions:&nbsp; block quotations, endnotes, and bibliography items may be single-spaced.&nbsp; Submit one copy of the final draft to your faculty supervisor, as well as an e-copy to the Caspersen School office at <a href="mailto:jmontros@drew.edu">jmontros@drew.edu</a>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Public Humanities &nbsp;Internships</strong></p> 
                    <p>The History and Culture program prepares all its students for academic careers, but we also go beyond that to engage the larger world.&nbsp; The Public Humanities Internship (HC 805) &nbsp;introduces students to alternative career possibilities for humanities scholars, and demonstrates how humanities scholarship can be mobilized outside of a traditional academic setting for socially productive ends.&nbsp; This three-credit course will involve working with a humanities organization outside the university: for example, a museum, a publisher, a magazine, a foundation, or even a business corporation that can make use of a humanities scholar.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>Each internship must conclude with a product of some sort, such as a paper, report, or a project the intern worked on during his or her stay.&nbsp; It should demonstrate a productive collaboration between humanities scholarship and a topic or venture of public concern.&nbsp; The nature and scope of the product (which is analogous to a research paper in other graduate courses) should be discussed and agreed on by the student, the host organization, and the seminar instructor.&nbsp; The instructor will evaluate the final product, which will have considerable weight in determining the student’s grade for the course.</p> 
                    <p>As soon as you register for the course, contact Drew University’s Center for Career Development, which will help you secure an internship, in consultation with the seminar instructor.&nbsp; Some internships pay modest stipends, which students can use to cover travel and other expenses.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Transfer Credits</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After they have satisfactorily completed their first academic year, doctoral students may apply to transfer graduate credits earned at other universities, up to a total of 9 credits (3 courses).&nbsp; Applicants should submit to the Convenor an Advanced Standing Petition (http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms), along with copies of transcripts and course catalogue descriptions. Applications must be approved by both the Director and the Committee on Academic Standing.&nbsp; Credits are only eligible for transfer (1) if they were earned within ten years of the student’s entry into the History and Culture program, (2) if the course addressed academic issues that engage the History and Culture program, and (3) if the student earned a grade of at least A-.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Academic Standards and Financial Aid</strong></p> 
                    <p>Graduate Academic Merit Scholarships range from 20-100% of annual tuition and are offered to incoming graduate students. Candidates for the scholarships are nominated by the area faculty in consultation with the Office of Financial Assistance and the Dean of the Caspersen School. To retain their scholarship, students must be enrolled full-time (nine credit hours per semester) and shall display meritorious progress toward the degree.</p> 
                    <p>MA degree students must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA each semester and a cumulative minimum 3.00 GPA. Any student who fails to achieve this GPA minimum is placed on academic probation for one semester. If that student is placed on strict academic probation for the following semester, she/he may be ineligible for financial assistance. Full-time students are expected to complete the degree in four semesters. Drew’s financial aid awards are limited to a total of six semesters. All academic requirements for the degree must be completed within five years from the date of initial matriculation.</p> 
                    <p>At the end of each academic year, all HC doctoral students will receive a letter assessing their overall academic performance. Doctoral students must maintain a 3.5 GPA each semester and a cumulative 3.5 GPA.&nbsp; Upon review by HC faculty in consultation with the Dean, a doctoral student who fails to achieve the cumulative 3.5 GPA may be placed on academic probation for one semester.&nbsp; If that doctoral student is placed on strict academic probation for the following semester, she/he may be ineligible for continued financial assistance at the initial level or may be ineligible for continued financial assistance.&nbsp; This policy also applies to the stipends awarded to Fellows (see below).&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Dissertations</strong></p> 
                    <p>At the beginning of the third year, in consultation with his/her faculty advisor, each doctoral student will form a dissertation committee consisting of three faculty, one of whom may be based at another university.&nbsp; Dissertation Guidelines may be found at <a href="http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms">http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms</a>.</p> 
                    <p>Each dissertation must ultimately undergo an oral defense and must be unanimously approved by the dissertation committee. When the student has prepared a final draft and is ready to defend, the committee will consult with the student to invite a fourth reader from another university.</p> 
                    <p><strong>II. Services and Resources</strong></p> 
                    <p><strong>Faculty Advisors</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faculty advisors are assigned to all incoming students.&nbsp; Before registering for classes, students should always consult with their faculty advisors.&nbsp; You can change advisors whenever you like: just make sure you have the permission of your new advisor, then inform the Associate Dean of the change.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Student Fellows</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A select number of our strongest doctoral students are History and Culture Fellows, who enjoy special benefits and have special responsibilities.&nbsp; Fellows receive free tuition and a living stipend.&nbsp; They must pursue their studies full-time, completing the MA and PhD in five years, and there may be some restrictions on accepting outside employment.&nbsp; (There are no restrictions on outside employment for other students, who may study part-time, as few as one course per semester.) &nbsp;In their second year, Fellows work as teaching assistants in Drew survey courses.&nbsp; In their third year, they will teach their own courses at local colleges.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Professional Development Workshops</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the academic year the History and Culture program and the Graduate Division of Religion cosponsor a series of Professional Development Workshops for students.&nbsp; These address the practical side of building an academic career: e.g., how to draft a CV, conduct a job interview, present a conference paper, apply for a grant, publish your research.&nbsp; Attendance is voluntary, but bear in mind that these workshops offer much useful (indeed, essential) advice.</p> 
                    <p><strong>The History and Culture Colloquium</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting about once a month, the History and Culture Colloquium showcases innovative research by Drew faculty and graduate students as well outside scholars.&nbsp; Papers representing work-in-progress are precirculated to students and faculty and then, at the colloquium, are discussed with the authors.&nbsp; Colloquia are open to all members of the Drew University community.&nbsp; History and Culture students are strongly encouraged to attend.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Book Review Database</strong></p> 
                    <p>Book reviews that students write for classes can be posted onto the Moodle site “H&amp;C reviews,” where they will be accessible to the Drew community and provide a valuable resource for other graduate students. You should submit your review to your instructor electronically, and provide a header in the following form: Author, <em>Book Title</em> (Place of Publication: Publisher, Date), number of pages. Review by Your Name. &nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>For example:</p> 
                    <p>Eric T. Love, <em>Race Over Empire: Racism and U.S. Imperialism, 1865-1900</em></p> 
                    <p>(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004). 245 pages.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conference and Dissertation Grants</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For students who are presenting papers at conferences, the Graduate Student Association will cover $450 up to twice a year. The Caspersen School may provide funding beyond that, but usually no more than a total of $750 a year. If available, the Caspersen School can also provide grants (usually up to $750) to support dissertation research trips, one per student.</p> 
                    <p>​&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should apply for travel to conference grants through the forms on the GSA page. For the dissertation travel grants, the form is on the Dean’s page. ​</p>

                     <li><strong>The Third Year</strong></li> 
                    </ol> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the five-year History and Culture doctoral program, the third year is the “bridge.”&nbsp; You have completed your coursework and have not yet begun researching your dissertation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is much to do in this interval, which may well be your busiest year.&nbsp; It requires careful planning and no slackening of self-discipline.&nbsp; These guidelines should help you schedule your various responsibilities.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Writing Workshop</strong></p> 
                    <p>All third-year PhD students must enroll in HC 806: Writing as a Public Intellectual Workshop.&nbsp; Offered annually in the spring semester and taught by a professional nonfiction writer, this seminar will teach academics how to communicate topics in history and culture to a general audience.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Foreign Languages</strong></p> 
                    <p>PhD students specializing in Continental Europe must pass an examination in one foreign language. Normally the language will be French, German, or Spanish, but another language may be substituted if it is deemed useful to the student’s research. Foreign language examinations are not required for MA students or for PhD students specializing in the United States, Britain, or Ireland.&nbsp; To set up an examination, speak with Associate Dean Bill Rogers.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Student Portfolios</strong></p> 
                    <p>Each PhD student must, in the third academic year, demonstrate his/her preparation as a teacher and scholar by satisfactorily completing a portfolio which will consist of the following:</p> 
                    <ul> 
                     <li>Three capstone essays.</li> 
                     <li>A public lecture.</li> 
                     <li>Two book reviews.</li> 
                     <li>Two course syllabi.</li> 
                     <li>An essay on an academic topic addressed to a nonacademic audience.</li> 
                     <li>Your faculty advisor must submit a Portfolio Completion Form (<a href="http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms">http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms</a>) certifying &nbsp;that all elements of your portfolio have been satisfactorily completed by the end of your third year.&nbsp; Here are the requirements for each of them:</li> 
                    </ul> 
                    <p><strong>Capstone Essays</strong>: See below.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Public Lecture: </strong>This lecture, on an academic topic, may be delivered to any audience: a scholarly conference, a church group, a fraternal organization, an adult education program, the Drew University community, or another college.&nbsp; Ideally your faculty advisor should be in the audience, but at the very least he/she should read your text.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Two Book Reviews: </strong>You will probably write at least two book reviews in your coursework: submit the strongest of these.&nbsp; If you prefer, you can write reviews expressly for your portfolio.&nbsp; These reviews need not be published, but if you have published reviews in scholarly journals, by all means include them in your portfolio.&nbsp; In fact we recommend that, as soon as possible, you start writing reviews for academic journals or websites (such as H-Net).&nbsp; Ask your faculty advisor about the leading journals in your field, then send the editors your CV along with a cover letter offering your services as a reviewer and outlining your areas of expertise.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Two Course Syllabi: </strong>These can be syllabi you used in your student teaching (see below) or syllabi for a course you have yet to teach.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Essay for a Nonacademic Audience: </strong>This can be the essay you wrote for HC 806: Writing as a Public Intellectual Workshop.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p><strong>Capstone Essays</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All doctoral students are required to write three capstone essays in the third year of their graduate studies.&nbsp; For each of these essays, the student will master, summarize, and criticize a body of historical literature.&nbsp; The essays should address the following three fields:</p> 
                    <p><em>Field 1:</em> Intellectual and cultural history.</p> 
                    <p><em>Field 2:</em> A specialized field in history other than intellectual/cultural history. Examples include political history, diplomatic history, disability history, social history, or any other subfield supported by the teaching and research expertise of the History and Culture faculty.</p> 
                    <p><em>Field 3:</em> An interdisciplinary field that explores the intersections between history and another discipline, such as literary studies, classics, anthropology, political science, sociology, art history, or economics.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don’t have to reach a hard and fast decision about your three fields in your first semester of coursework, but you should begin to think about them.&nbsp; In consultation with your faculty advisor, plan your course selections with your future capstone essays in mind.&nbsp; You should take at least two courses covering each field.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More serious planning should begin early in your final semester of coursework.&nbsp; Sit down with your faculty advisor and the Director to plan out your three fields.&nbsp; Select a First Reader and Second Reader for each field – and make sure they are agreeable to working with you.&nbsp; (Faculty based at other universities may serve as readers.)&nbsp; Print the Capstone Essays petition from http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms, fill it out, and send it to the Convenor.&nbsp; Once it is approved by the Convenor and the Committee on Academic Standing, you are ready to begin your readings.&nbsp; Make sure the approval process is completed before the end of the semester: then, once you have finished all your course work, you can start immediately on your capstone essays, and make productive use of your summer.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet individually with all three of your First Readers, who will help you plan out your reading lists.&nbsp; The list for each essay should run to 30-40 books or the equivalent in articles, all secondary works rather than primary texts.&nbsp; (We assume that you have covered essential primary sources in your coursework.)&nbsp; The final essay itself should be 30-40 pp. of text, plus a complete bibliography.&nbsp; While you are reading and writing, you should meet occasionally with your Readers to discuss your work and thrash out ideas.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How broad an area should each essay cover?&nbsp; Obviously it should be focused, but not as specialized as a dissertation topic.&nbsp; The point of this exercise is to demonstrate to potential employer that you are prepared to teach in certain areas, so your subject should be a plausible title for a college course.&nbsp; For example, you obviously can’t cover the whole field of cultural history, nor should you limit yourself to the French response to Jerry Lewis, but an essay on modern French cultural history would be about right.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each essay should survey and criticize recent work in a given historiographical subfield.&nbsp; What important trends do you see?&nbsp; Which questions are scholars addressing – or overlooking?&nbsp; What methodologies and&nbsp; sources are they using – or ignoring?&nbsp; What debates are they engaged in, and what is their state of play?&nbsp; Which assumptions are they sharing – or overturning Are historians breaking genuinely new ground or are they stuck in the past?&nbsp; Where are they located ideologically?&nbsp; What should they be doing that they aren’t doing?&nbsp; Do some of these trends cut across subfields?&nbsp; Have the boundaries between subfields (social/intellectual/cultural/military/medical/political history etc.) become blurred as specialists in these fields borrow from each other? &nbsp;Convey some sense of how this subfield has developed over time.&nbsp; Conclude with suggestions for future research.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should <em>not </em>write 40 one-page reviews of 40 books strung together.&nbsp; You should focus on issues, and bring particular readings into the discussion whenever they are relevant to those issues.&nbsp; That means you may have to discuss a book in one context and then, several pages later, return to it in another context.&nbsp; You may decide that some books merit extended discussion, others deserve only a brief mention, and still others are irrelevant to your discussion and should be replaced with other books.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should touch on most (though not necessarily all) of the works on your reading list.&nbsp; Your bibliography should include all the works you read, whether or not you actually discussed them.&nbsp; The essay should be properly footnoted, following Chicago or MLA style.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Completed essays should be e-mailed to the Caspersen School office (<a href="mailto:jmontros@drew.edu">jmontros@drew.edu</a>) , which will forward them to your First and Second Readers.&nbsp; They can assign one of three grades: Qualified with Distinction (QD), Qualified (Q), or Not Qualified (NQ).&nbsp; You need at least two Q grades to pass.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your essay does not receive a passing grade from either Reader, you can revise and resubmit, but be sure to consult first with your First and Second Readers.&nbsp; (Readers normally do not write comments on capstone essays.)&nbsp; All three capstone essays must be satisfactorily completed by the end of the third year of study (for full-time students) or within two years of the completion of course work (for part-time students).</p> 
                    <p><strong>The Dissertation Prospectus</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Toward the end of the third year each student will select a dissertation committee consisting of three faculty, one of whom may be based at another university. The student should file a Dissertation Committee Form with the Caspersen School office and then &nbsp;draft a prospectus. (The form and the prospectus cover sheet will be found at <a href="http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms">http://www.drew.edu/graduate/deans-office/forms</a>.)&nbsp; All three members of the dissertation committee must approve the prospectus.Before the committee approves the prospectus, the student must have at least one face-to-face meeting with all members of the committee (exceptions may be allowed for non-Drew faculty).</p> 
                    <p>The prospectus should be a detailed ten-page research plan plus a bibliography.&nbsp; It should be structured in five sections:</p> 
                    <ol> 
                     <li>State your thesis and explain its importance.</li> 
                     <li>Review prior scholarship on this subject.</li> 
                     <li>Explain your methodology and the new and distinctive contribution that your dissertation will make.</li> 
                     <li>Chapter outline.</li> 
                     <li>Bibliography, with separate sections for primary and secondary sources.</li> 
                    </ol> 
                    <p><strong>Student Teaching</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both semesters of their second year, Fellows are required to serve as teaching assistants in history or history-related survey courses at Drew University.&nbsp; There may also be a limited number of teaching assistantships for other doctoral students, who will receive a modest stipend.&nbsp; Teaching assistants will be assigned to appropriate courses by the Convenor.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All first-time teaching assistants are required to attend a series of pedagogical workshops cosponsored by the Graduate Division of Religion and the History and Culture program.&nbsp; These workshops, which offer valuable teacher training, may also have openings for a limited number of other graduate students.</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Fellows are required to teach one undergraduate course at a local college in each semester of their third year.&nbsp; This is also recommended (but not required) for other third-year doctoral students.&nbsp; Any adjunct salary that Fellows receive will be returned to Drew University;<a href="#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[J1]</a>&nbsp; other students will keep their salaries.&nbsp; Teaching more than one course per semester is prohibited for Fellows and discouraged for other students.&nbsp; At the beginning of your final semester of coursework, you should supply the Associate Dean with a CV and ask him to arrange teaching assignments at local colleges for the following year.&nbsp;</p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign students may have visas that limit their opportunities to work off-campus.&nbsp; They can secure off-campus work authorization for adjunct teaching by registering for INTG 900, a one credit course. Forms and further information can be obtained from the Associate Dean.&nbsp; At the end of their teaching semester, adjunct instructors should report back to the Associate Dean, who will enter a grade of S for them.</p> 
                    <p><strong>The Dean Hopper New Scholars Conference</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September, the Convenor will convene a planning meeting for our annual Dean Hopper New Scholars Conference.&nbsp; (The first such conference was held in June 2013.)&nbsp; Participation in this conference is mandatory for all third-year doctoral students and optional for all other Drew graduate students.&nbsp; Except for one or two keynotes by senior scholars, all the papers at this conference will be presented by graduate students or new PhDs.&nbsp; A faculty advisor will offer general guidance, but beyond that the third-year students will be responsible for all aspects of the conference: selecting the theme, drafting and disseminating the call for papers, selecting the papers to be presented from among the abstracts submitted, recruiting the keynoters, publicizing the conference, and arranging all the logistics.&nbsp; The conference will be held the following May or June, after Commencement.</p> 
                    <p><strong>Construct a Calendar</strong></p> 
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can see, you have a lot to do, with only one fixed deadline: everything must be finished by the end of the third year.&nbsp; You don’t want to drift along until April and then hurriedly attempt to pull everything together at the last minute.&nbsp; Therefore, at the end of your second year, sit down with your faculty advisor and draft a calendar for the coming year, laying down self-imposed deadlines for each of the tasks outlined above.&nbsp; Since you will inevitably miss some of these intermediate deadlines, build some slack into your schedule.&nbsp; And meet with your faculty advisor at least once a month, just to ensure that you’re on track.&nbsp; In past years third-year students have found it helpful to organize a support group for mutual encouragement and socializing.</p>
