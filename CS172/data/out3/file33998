In 2003, Josh lived in Seville, Spain and began his ongoing study of flamenco guitar at the University of Pablo de Olavide. He conducted research in Seville during the 2011-12 academic year, supported by a Fulbright IIE fellowship. This work addresses how Andalusian histories, landscapes and performance spaces relate to musical and social practices within flamenco communities. Also, the Morón style of flamenco serves as a central case study through which Josh evaluates stylistic and performative elements within the context of tradition. For his M.A. thesis, he explored how popular music, American folk ideology and leftist politics converged and intensified at a key folk institution in Los Angeles known as the Ash Grove. Other research interests include the politics of identity and race, cultural memory, social movements, political activism and the bearing of historical conceptions and constructions on the discipline of ethnomusicology.</td>

In 2008 he completed his master&#x2019;s research on bluegrass, based both on fieldwork with musicians in southern California, and on reflections and research about bluegrass in different regions of the United States, and in different political and social contexts. In late 2009, Jake left California for Temuco, a city in southern Chile, where he has conducted grant-funded research with support from the University of California&#x2019;s Pacific Rim Research Program, and from Fulbright IIE. Jake&#x2019;s two subsequent years in Temuco involved research on music as it relates to the concept of <em>frontera</em> (or <em>borderland</em>)&#x2014;an idea which has characterized the cultural, political and social dynamics of the region around Temuco since well before the arrival of the Spanish in the 1540s. Southern Chile is rich in folkloric music styles, but also in hip-hop, rock, indigenous Mapuche music, and various types of fusion music unique to the region. Jake&#x2019;s dissertation deals with case studies in several genres, and their relationships to tumultous struggles over territorial sovereignty and social welfare. Currently, Jake is writing his dissertation while working as an adjunct professor at the Universidad de la Frontera in Temuco, where he teaches &#x201c;Introducción a la Etnomusicología.&#x201d;</td>

                  <td valign="top"><strong>Desmond Stevens</strong><br> desmond.t.stevens@gmail.com<br> <br> Desmond Stevens received his BA degrees in Music Education and Sociology from UCLA in 2009. He also holds an MA in Musicology from UC Riverside (2011). During his time at Riverside, he focused his studies on the music of nineteenth and twentieth century Latin American classical and popular musics. His thesis investigated the music of Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla and the Argentine expectations of national musical identity. Since receiving his master's degree he worked as a music teacher in public middle and high schools in the LA and Orange Counties. Currently he is working as the instrumental music teacher at Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove where he is fusing traditional high school instrumental instruction (strings, winds, and percussion) with a specifically tailored curriculum incorporating elements of Western music history, World music history, and Ethnomusicology which reflects the diverse demographics of his school's student body.</td>

Encounters 2015 will begin with a thrilling recital, on February 13, of two-piano music by Latin American composers, especially from Colombia, featuring the virtuosic duo of Daniel Cunha (Portugal) and Evangelos Spanos (Greece). Two recitals will be presented by renowned Colombian soprano Patricia Caicedo, whose recordings, recitals, and scholarly editions actively promote the songs of her native country, as well as the rest of Latin America. With the assistance of renowned accompanist by Nikos Stavlas, her first recital, on February 20, will present art songs by various Colombian composers. The second concert, on February 27, will focus on folk and popular songs of Colombia, and she will be accompanied by celebrated Colombian guitarist Ricardo Cobo. (In addition, on February 18, she and Nikos will present a Wednesday at Noon lecture-demonstration on Catalan art songs, a specialty of theirs, as they live in Barcelona.) The final event of this year&#x2019;s Encuentros will be a Wednesday at Noon presentation, on March 4, by Colombian scholar Daniel Castro, a doctoral student in musicology at UCR, and UCR lecturer and pianist Gary Barnett. Together they will talk about and demonstrate the piano music of Guillermo Uribe Holguín (1880-1971), one of Colombia&#x2019;s greatest composers.
