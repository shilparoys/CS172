        <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1344 fancy" alt="ewcl-class-5-Abdullahi Hussein Ali" src="http://ewcl.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ewcl-class-5-Abdullahi-Hussein-Ali.jpg" width="150" height="150">
        <strong>Abdullahi Hussein Ali</strong> is a Kenyan National interested in wildlife ecology and conservation of arid ecosystem particularly in the biodiversity rich horn of Africa region. His current work is focusing on the ecology and conservation of the globally endangered hirola antelope (Beatragus hunteri) in northeastern Kenya. This unique antelope is restricted to the Kenya-Somalia border and it is the world’s most endangered antelope. Ali grew up in a small village on the outskirts of Garissa town; a city located nearly 400 KM northeast of the capital Nairobi, Kenya. His rural home coincides with the geographic range of the hirola antelope and over the years Ali watched the dwindling of the species; today he is endeavoring to save them from extinction.
        <p></p> 
        <p>Ali received his master’s degree in conservation biology (2010) and his bachelor’s degree in wildlife management (2005), both from the University of Nairobi. Ali is now a third-year doctoral student in the Program in Ecology (<a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/pie/index.html">PIE</a>) at the University of Wyoming and an <a href="http://www.edgeofexistence.org/index.php">EDGE</a> (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) Fellow, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.zsl.org/">Zoological Society of London</a>. Since 2005, Ali has been working with National Museums of Kenya as field ecologist, much of his work focused on dryland biodiversity conservation in northeastern Kenya.</p> 
        <p>His PhD dissertation is focusing on hirola population dynamics, habitat use, and the effects of land-use change for hirola. These are knowledge gaps that have been consistently identified as research priorities for future hirola conservation. Ali and his team employ GPS telemetry using Vectronics GPS plus collars, mark-resight and sight-resight analyses to gather unprecedented information on hirola demography and movement. In addition, they are analysing multi-temporal remotely-sensed imagery to determine the collective impacts of overgrazing, fire suppression, and elephant reductions on shrub encroachment in the area.</p> 
        <p>Although hirola have never been common, they have dwindled in number from roughly 10,000 in 1970 to somewhere around 300-500 today. The reasons for this decline (and equally the reasons preventing contemporary recovery) are mysterious; formal research in this geographic area has been logistically difficult given political unrest and tribalism. However, Ali and his team suspect that a combination of habitat loss; competition with livestock; predation; disease; and drought have been responsible for historic declines while predation and range degradation are combining to suppress contemporary recovery. Results from his research will be used to guide management strategies through the Hirola Management Committee of the Kenya Wildlife Service.</p>

Her love of primates as a child has fueled her career path as a primatologist and conservationist throughout her life.</p> 
        <p>Graduating in 2002 with a BA in Animal Behavior from Franklin and Marshall College, Kelly has since worked as a primate zookeeper at the Houston Zoo, a chimpanzee caretaker at the Center for Chimpanzee Conservation in Guinea, and project manager at the Fongoli Savanna Chimpanzee research site in Senegal. In 2010 she completed her M.A. in Anthropology from Iowa State studying the density and distribution of previously unstudied chimpanzee populations in southeastern Senegal. This research led her to establish the FCC project in the same year to promote chimpanzee conservation through education, stakeholder collaboration and ecological research in Senegal. Today she continues to study unhabituated chimpanzee groups in Senegal using non-invasive methods such as camera traps, nest surveys and interviews with local people. Her research interests are in human/wildlife conflict and effects of anthropogenic activities on chimpanzees and their habitat.</p> 
        <p>Along with hopping back and forth between Senegal and Iowa, Kelly also enjoys running, salsa dancing, and yoga-ing.</p>

Since then he has had a passion for environmental conservation- both in making a case for protecting the planet’s natural resources, as well as seeking the coexistence of nature and human progress. He is a Program Officer at the World Wildlife Fund, working on sustainable Agriculture and helping corporations identify environmental and social impacts of the production of the Agricultural commodities in their supply chains. He recently received a Master’s degree in Conservation Biology and Sustainable Development from the University of Maryland. He also has Bachelor’s degrees in Wildlife Biology and Photojournalism from the University of Wyoming. Daniel has a wide range of skills and experiences, ranging from being an environmental educator in Hawaii, to doing field research with Ocelots and Coyotes in Western Mexico, to web design and programming (in cyberspace).

Originally from Columbus, Ohio, Brandon grew up enjoying nature and the outdoors and soon realized how important it was to protect and foster it. During his undergraduate work at Davidson (NC) College, Brandon volunteered at the Carolina Raptor Center as a rehabilitator for sick and injured birds-of-prey. Before receiving his degree in Biology, he was honored to have been chosen as host student for visiting scientist Dr. Jane Goodall, whose passion and commitment was contagious and further fed his interest in conservation. Recently, Brandon has coordinated a collaborative effort between the University of Central Florida, SeaWorld Orlando, the Smithsonian National Zoo, and the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute to examine the transition to nutritional independence in pinniped pups in an effort to improve the husbandry of sea lions within zoological facilities.</p> 
        <p>Brandon’s professional career began at the Columbus Zoo before eventually leading to SeaWorld Orlando. His experience includes working with a variety of animal species, including marine mammals such as sea lions, dolphins and killer whales, as well as various species of birds and small mammals. As the supervisor of SeaWorld’s Animal Ambassador Team, Brandon was able to witness how much impact even the smallest of animals can have on people and their interest in helping the environment. In addition, as a volunteer for the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, Brandon has had the privilege of seeing how people’s support can directly impact conservation efforts in the field. For the past several years, Brandon has also had the privilege to serve as SeaWorld Orlando’s animal ambassador and spokesman throughout the country. He particularly enjoys bringing animals into the classroom where he tries to help children realize that they too can make a difference and hopefully become tomorrow’s conservation leaders. Brandon looks forward to gathering with colleagues and mentors as a participant in the 2013-2014 Emerging Wildlife Conservation Leaders Program.</p>

I am interested also in tropical terrestrial mammal movement and its relations with food, habitat use, and interactions with other wildlife. These involve the use of technology. I conducted a radio-telemetry study of the ecology and use of space of agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) in BCI-Panama. This was one of the first studies of its kind in the Centro American neotropics; it provided important information on the agouti home range, use of habitat and resources, and predation. Recently I’ve been studying in Bolivia, the effects of the presence of different mammal densities on survivorship of seed and seedlings, I focused on the presence of white-lipped peccaries, and the effect of this species over a Palm, I find out that in the absence of the peccaries (due to human hunting), the densities of the palm seedling increases, affecting the adult densities, and therefore the forest structure. Also, and for many years I am involved in the conservation and research of the Bolivian river dolphin (Inia boliviensis), and endemic cetacean that lives in the tropical rivers of Bolivia, this species was declared as Natural heritage of the country, however the threats to the habitat and the populations are pressuring this species.</p>
