     <p>(1) The legislature finds that businesses and organizations providing services to children, developmentally disabled persons, and vulnerable adults need adequate information to determine which employees or licensees to hire or engage. The legislature further finds that many developmentally disabled individuals and vulnerable adults desire to hire their own employees directly and also need adequate information to determine which employees or licensees to hire or engage. Therefore, the Washington state patrol identification and criminal history section shall disclose, upon the request of a business or organization as defined in RCW <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.43.830">43.43.830</a>, a developmentally disabled person, or a vulnerable adult as defined in RCW <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.43.830">43.43.830</a> or his or her guardian, an applicant's conviction record as defined in chapter <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.97">10.97</a> RCW.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) The legislature also finds that the Washington professional educator standards board may request of the Washington state patrol criminal identification system information regarding a certificate applicant's conviction record under subsection (1) of this section.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) The legislature also finds that law enforcement agencies, the office of the attorney general, prosecuting authorities, and the department of social and health services may request this same information to aid in the investigation and prosecution of child, developmentally disabled person, and vulnerable adult abuse cases and to protect children and adults from further incidents of abuse.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) The legislature further finds that the secretary of the department of social and health services must establish rules and set standards to require specific action when considering the information listed in subsection (1) of this section, and when considering additional information including but not limited to civil adjudication proceedings as defined in RCW <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.43.830">43.43.830</a> and any out-of-state equivalent, in the following circumstances:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) When considering persons for state employment in positions directly responsible for the supervision, care, or treatment of children, vulnerable adults, or individuals with mental illness or developmental disabilities;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) When considering persons for state positions involving unsupervised access to vulnerable adults to conduct comprehensive assessments, financial eligibility determinations, licensing and certification activities, investigations, surveys, or case management; or for state positions otherwise required by federal law to meet employment standards;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) When licensing agencies or facilities with individuals in positions directly responsible for the care, supervision, or treatment of children, developmentally disabled persons, or vulnerable adults, including but not limited to agencies or facilities licensed under chapter <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.15">74.15</a> or <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.51">18.51</a> RCW;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) When contracting with individuals or businesses or organizations for the care, supervision, case management, or treatment, including peer counseling, of children, developmentally disabled persons, or vulnerable adults, including but not limited to services contracted for under chapter <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.20">18.20</a>, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.127">70.127</a>, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.128">70.128</a>, <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=72.36">72.36</a>, or <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.39A">74.39A</a> RCW or Title <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A">71A</a> RCW;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) When individual providers are paid by the state or providers are paid by home care agencies to provide in-home services involving unsupervised access to persons with physical, mental, or developmental disabilities or mental illness, or to vulnerable adults as defined in chapter <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.34">74.34</a> RCW, including but not limited to services provided under chapter <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.39">74.39</a> or <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.39A">74.39A</a> RCW.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) The director of the department of early learning shall investigate the conviction records, pending charges, and other information including civil adjudication proceeding records of current employees and of any person actively being considered for any position with the department who will or may have unsupervised access to children, or for state positions otherwise required by federal law to meet employment standards.
