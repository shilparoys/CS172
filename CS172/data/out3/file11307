               <p>Humans interact with the Earth in many ways: we use natural resources, experience natural hazards, and design geoengineering techniques that modify natural processes. In this course, we consider how a diversity of human activities affects our environment, and how a diversity of natural processes affects humans. These topics will help us delve into the meaning of "sustainability" from the perspective of Earth scientists. We will use the modern and historic New Jersey landscape as a case study, but we will also discuss topics such as mountaintop removal in the Appalachians, earthquakes in Indonesia, and water usage in the Western US. Students will learn basic Earth science concepts, techniques for field scientists, methods of data analysis and presentation, and skills for effectively teasing apart complex environmental issues.

Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we will consider how values, paradigms, policies, technologies, and their intricate interactions determine our current unsustainable relationship with nature, and we will explore proposals for moving society in an environmentally sustainable direction.</p>

               <p>This course explores the science behind environmental problems and solutions. Students study current environmental issues in the context of their scientific (biological, chemical, geological) underpinnings, while alos considering the political, social and cultural dimensions of these issues. The course also addresses the role of scientific knowledge in understanding and resolving environmental problems, such as climate change, population growth, deforestation, extinction, air and water pollution, food production, and environmental health. These topics are explored through readings, films, student writing, research and field trips.</p>

               <p>The course provides a study of the moral and religious aspects of such problems in human ecology as pollution, overpopulation, resource depletion, animal rights, global justice and much more. The course relates these issues to religious perspectives of human nature, responsibilities to the earth and to future generations. While the ecological data and principles prove indispensable, the primary intent of the course is to focus on how people make the date speak, on what they bring to ecological issues, on methods, on assumptions, and on language. This will require critical thinking skills such as analyzing, evaluating, and comparing. Offered in spring semester of odd numbered years.</p>

We will explore the dynamics of planet Earth through exploring many of the myths and misconceptions created by Hollywood movies. Using well?known films, we will learn about earthquakes, volcanoes, meteors, evolution, and climate. We will conclude by discussing how the public's perception of the environment and of scientists is influenced by the way the entertainment industry, news media, and the scientific community present geologic concepts.</p>

               <p>This class is a cross-cultural exploration of the ways that people think about and interact with wild animals. Drawing on a wide range of interdisciplinary sources, we will ponder abstract philosophical questions like "What is an animal?", "What is natural?" and "What is human?" As an ESS course, however, this class will pay special attention to the ways that different perspectives on wild animals influence larger global concerns, such as biodiversity, invasive species, animal conservation, and animal rights. Upon completion of this class, students should: 1) possess a broad knowledge of the plasticity of thought and practices relating to wild animals that exists within particular societies, between different societies, and across time; 2) understand the important role that wild animals play in helping human beings define and understand themselves; and 3) appreciate the value of cross-cultural research methodologies.&nbsp;</p>

               <p>&nbsp;The Arctic is experiencing rapid environmental change due largely to human activities in the south. Three of the processes that are creating the most dramatic changes in Arctic ecosystems are the transnational flow of industrial toxins, climate change, and intensified resource exploration and extraction. This course focuses on how these three processes are affecting the livelihood of roughly 160,000 Inuit living in Siberia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland. By focusing on Inuit strategies and engagements, this course will dispel enduring misconceptions of northern peoples as passive victims of outside forces while simultaneously examining the considerable challenges that they face in maintaining control of their lives and land.&nbsp; Ultimately, I hope this course raises awareness about how our own lifestyles are exacerbating environmental injustices and culture change in the Far North.

              <dd id="8406-d">
               <p>This introductory course focused on the challenges involved with manufacturing and using materials and chemicals in the modern world. Substances ranging from adhesives to asphalt, fibers to food, cars to clothes, carpets to cosmetics, diapers to drugs, inks to insecticides, perfumes to pesticides, pharmaceuticals to plastics, wood to water treatment chemicals and many others are based on the synthesis, processing, formulation, use and eventual disposal or recycling of chemical entities. Thus an understanding of the basis for the environmentally sound production of diverse chemicals and materials as well as emerging alternative processes is vital for the sustainable and safe use of items made from chemicals. In this course we will explore, describe and evaluate the myriad ways in which selected, important chemicals and materials are made and used as we ask, how can these processes and products become benign by design, eco-effective and "green"? .</p>

               <p>A study of the complex relationships between individuals and their physical environments, from the countryside to the jungle, in represenative literary works of the 19th and 20th centuries. We will address how interactions withp lace and geography become discursive tools by which to explore various social, cultural and national discourses. The manifestations and permutations of the environmental imagination across various literary movements, from Romanticism to Regionalism, are explored, while also addressing the role of eco-criticism within literary cultural studies.</p>

               <p>This course explores the science behind environmental problems and solutions. Students study current environmental issues in the context of their scientific (biological, chemical, geological) underpinnings, while alos considering the political, social and cultural dimensions of these issues. The course also addresses the role of scientific knowledge in understanding and resolving environmental problems, such as climate change, population growth, deforestation, extinction, air and water pollution, food production, and environmental health. These topics are explored through readings, films, student writing, research and field trips.</p>
