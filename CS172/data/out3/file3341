     <h2><strong>Parents Support Net - February 2014</strong></h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Dear Westmont Parents,</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">While it only seems a few weeks ago that we all returned from Christmas break, we’re fully engaged in the semester and planning for graduation in May. Spring semester goes so fast, peppered with so many activities and milestones for our students.&nbsp; They have just returned, as you likely know, from a much-needed break, and now they set their sights on papers, exams, spring break and its ministry opportunities, Spring Sing, and, before we know it, finals and Commencement for the largest graduating class in Westmont’s history!</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">In the midst of all the pressures and opportunities, Westmont remains committed to the well-being of your sons and daughters academically, physically, emotionally and spiritually. Every day I have the privilege of working with colleagues across the campus who use their gifts and passions to serve students in the classroom, counseling center, athletic fields, chapel, student life and activities, library, health center, our maintenance and custodial staffs and, yes, even our fundraising staff who seek to ensure that your student and future students can benefit from a transformative Westmont education. Rest assured that your students are well cared for as they navigate these exciting and life-changing days.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">I want you to know how much you encourage us as you entrust your student to our care, pray for us and engage in our community as you are able.&nbsp; We welcome your participation and feedback as we walk this road together.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;"><img src="images/Teri_WebPic_11.11_001.jpg" width="144" height="216" alt="Teri Bradford Rouse">Finally, I strongly encourage all of you to attend&nbsp;<a href="../ParentsWeekend.html"><u>Parents Weekend</u></a>, March 28-29. Whether you are the parent of a first-year student or a senior, Parents Weekend offers a range of activities that include one of our dynamic professors speaking about science and faith, a faculty member leading a thoughtful devotion and President Beebe talking about recent college developments.&nbsp; In addition, we’ve planned ample opportunities for you to meet and get to know one another.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">We’re grateful for you and hope to see you at Parent’s Weekend!</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Sincerely,<br> </p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Teri Bradford Rouse '77<br> Senior Director of Alumni and Parent Relations</p> 
     <h2>Spring Break Programs</h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Many students will participate in one of numerous enriching programs during spring break this year. If your student didn’t sign up this year, perhaps they will consider getting involved in the future.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Urban Initiative&nbsp;acts as a hub for community engagement at Westmont by introducing students to the realities of inner-city life and mobilizing our community in thoughtful response. During spring break, students will serve in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Francisco for Spring Break in the City 2014.Learn more about these opportunities&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/campuslife/urbaninitiative.html"><u>here</u></a>.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Potter's Clay:&nbsp;Begun in 1977, Potter’s Clay is one of Westmont’s longest-running traditions and our oldest continuous ministry and service program. Each year, the PC leadership team actively works with the Mexican core team in Ensenada and professional volunteers to plan a year of mutually beneficial ministry and service.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">During spring break, more than 300 Westmont students, staff, faculty and professional volunteers camp out beneath the stars at night and work enthusiastically during the day on teams across Ensenada: construction, medical/dental, photography, street dance teams, mobile salon, kitchen, sports, surf camps, praise and worship, and VBS. There is ample opportunity for ALL to be actively involved in supporting the long-term work of our Mexican partners in Ensenada!<br> Learn more about Potter’s Clay&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/campuslife/pc.html"><u>here</u></a>.</p> 
     <h2>Parents Council Profile:&nbsp;Lois '81 &amp; Greg '82 Marshall</h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Meet Parents Council members&nbsp;Lois ’81 and Greg ’82 Marshall&nbsp;and read what they have to say about Westmont, their three children and Parents Council.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westmont.edu/summerscholars/#Discover.html"><u></u></a><u><a href="http://www.westmont.edu/summerscholars/#Discover.html"><u><img src="images/MarshallFamily_ParentsCouncil.jpg" width="280" height="202" alt="Marshalls"></u></a><br> </u></p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Our family has been involved with Westmont almost from its inception. Lois' mother, Ethel Christensen Cornelius, started the ball rolling. Her Westmont experience began at the original Los Angeles campus where she was associated with the class of 1945! Her two older brothers preceded her at the college and are both proud alumni.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Lois and I met while students at Westmont,&nbsp;...&nbsp;and we have been married since 1986. We enjoyed the special gift of living in Santa Barbara as a young married couple. I served as an assistant basketball coach for the mighty Warriors for five years, working for the legendary Chet Kammerer.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">When it was time for our kids to start exploring colleges, we didn’t insist that they attend a Christian college. But we asked them to include at least one Christian college among their top choices. Our oldest son, Joe, graduated from Westmont in 2012, and the Marshall/Cornelius team was back on the board! Our daughter Jenna is currently a junior, living in Van Kampen Hall.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">As we have often stated, if you were to cut us, we bleed maroon, not red!</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">As members of Westmont’s Parents Council, we have the privilege of speaking to prospective students and their families and offering our perspective on the college. We’ve always valued the emphasis on Christ holding first place, the rock and chief focus of all we do. And the goal of academic excellence raises the bar high and challenges our students to excel.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">The Parents Council meets twice a year. During this time, we get a Cliff Notes briefing from every department. We’re amazed at the college’s extreme attention to detail, the long-range planning and the administration’s and faculty’s love for students. You should be proud of the work Westmont is doing. As good as the college is, we believe the best is yet to come.</p> 
     <h2>Westmont Impact Conference</h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;"><img src="images/ImpactConferenceGraphic.jpg" width="299" height="95" alt="Impact Conference">What if you could renew your faith while learning about the incredible ways people just like you are making an impact in the world? Even better, what if your teenage and adult children could join you? On June 19-20, Westmont will host the Impact Conference to provide just these opportunities. The event will feature speakers who want to inspire, challenge and engage participants about how they are making a difference in their communities, whether it’s at the beach, in the office or over social media. Register for a chance to hear from Christians who will challenge your heart and mind. Explore topics like abolishing human trafficking, using business and entrepreneurship for social change, and taking on the challenges of leadership. Discounts are available for groups of three or more, so make it a family affair!</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Do you have any questions? Feel free to email&nbsp;<u><a href="mailto:impact@westmont.edu"><u>impact@westmont.edu</u></a></u>&nbsp;or call Veronica Ocejo at&nbsp;<u>805-565-6264</u>.</p>

     <h2>President’s Breakfast</h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;"><img src="images/muhammad-yunus_000.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Muhammad Yunus">Muhammad Yunus, a pioneer in using microfinance to end poverty, will speak at the ninth annual Westmont President’s Breakfast Friday,&nbsp;Feb. 28, from 7-9 a.m.&nbsp;at The Fess Parker—A DoubleTree by Hyatt Resort. Yunus is the first person since Martin Luther King Jr. to achieve the trifecta of the Nobel Peace Prize, the U.S. Presidential Medal and the U.S. Congressional Medal. Students will have the opportunity to hear Yunus in chapel later that morning when he responds to questions from a panel of students. If you are anywhere near Santa Barbara on February 28, we encourage you to attend the breakfast and/or the chapel which follows.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">You can purchase tickets and learn more about the event&nbsp;<a href="http://www.westmont.edu/presbreakfast/"><u>here</u></a>.</p> 
     <h2>"God is Not Vague" - Words from Campus Pastor Ben Patterson</h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;"><img src="images/BenPatterson_Current_000.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Ben Patterson">God is not vague.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Though he is beyond us, he doesn’t typically say things that are totally over our heads.&nbsp; He wants to be understood and known—not comprehensively, for that would be impossible for us, but enough that we can know what he wants us to do and be.&nbsp; We may never know the depths of God’s truth, but he makes it accessible enough to wade in the shallows.&nbsp; How deep we go is a matter of grace and time and desire.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">I recently read through the book of the prophet Micah, and that’s what I came away with: God is not vague. Micah 6:8 contains one of the most famous summary statements in all the Bible of what God wants us to know and do.&nbsp;...&nbsp;That single verse has been memorized, preached and even sung for centuries: “He has shown you, O man, what is good.&nbsp; And what does the Lord require of you?&nbsp; To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”&nbsp; There is nothing vague about that.&nbsp; There are other things he is equally definite about.&nbsp; He hates, repeat hates, idolatry, injustice, rebellion and empty formalism in religion.&nbsp; Open Micah randomly to just about any page, and you will find expressions of God’s loathing of these things.&nbsp; But he is just as definite about how much he loves to forgive the penitent.&nbsp; He loves to restore those who do what he hates.&nbsp; Micah exults in this:&nbsp; “Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?&nbsp; You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy” (18).&nbsp; What could be better than to know exactly what God hates, loves and expects of us?</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">God is not vague, but we are.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Part of what it means to be a sinner is to know how to complicate the simple, make the unambiguous ambiguous and to qualify the unqualified.&nbsp; God responds to this obfuscation in kind; to the pure he shows himself pure, to the shrewd he shows himself shrewd (Cf. Ps 18:25-27), and to the vague he will seem vague. Reading a prophet like Micah scrubs the vagueness out of your brain.&nbsp; It works like a dash of cold water on the face or a compass in a dark forest pointing to true north.&nbsp; Read Micah and don’t be vague—heartily agree with what God hates and loves by praise, thanksgiving, petition and confession. And pray for Westmont, that as we teach students to appreciate the complexity of the world, we do not confuse it with being vague.</p> 
     <h2>Did You Know?</h2> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">First held in 1961, Spring Sing is Westmont’s longest running tradition. It also involves more students than any other Westmont activity throughout the year. In 1978, the Armington men’s skit, “Mucky Moose,” aired on NBC. For the first time in Westmont’s history, students living off campus (including Ocean View) will perform together. In the past, they were invited to join other residence halls but didn’t have the opportunity to act as a group. The Spring Sing Committee recently announced the 2014 theme: X Marks the Spot!</p>
