     <td width="80%"> <p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p><p>As part of its international development activities, IRIS International Development Seismology (IDS) is organizing a four-day Advanced Studies Institute focusing on Earthquake Location&nbsp;to be held in Bangkok, Thailand - January 14-17, 2012. </p> <p>The meeting immediately follows the <a href="http://www.iris.edu/workshops/2012/metadata/" target="_blank">IRIS Metadata Workshop</a>. <br>* A detailed agenda can be found <a href="agenda.pdf">[ here ]</a>. 
       <!--Please register for the Metadata Workshop
               if you are interested in attending the institute.--> </p> <p><a name="_GoBack"></a><strong>Earthquake Location: Recent Developments, Challenges and Opportunites and Double Difference Techniques for Earthquake Location</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Multiple event relocation</em></strong><em>.</em> This session will give an overview of multiple event location methods. It will introduce and apply the concept of double-difference and crosscorrelation methods for high-resolution seismic event location. The hypoDD algorithm will be used together with pre-prepared data sets that include network generated parametric data and high-precision delay-time measurements from similar seismograms to demonstrate relocation procedures and performance. Lecture material will include strategies for building differential-time networks, waveform cross-correlation, 1D and 3D velocity models for data prediction, regularization and data weighting, relative location error estimation, evaluation of solution robustness, and analysis of results. The lecture material will be illustrated with earthquake data from various tectonic settings. This section of the Institute will have a lab component where participants will work on selected data sets for software training and to acquire hands-on experience on the topics presented during the lecture. Participants with access to data are encouraged to bring their own data sets to the Institute in order to benefit from one-on-one instructor assistance. During the hands-on session, the pre-prepared or participant provided data set is used for software training</p> <p><strong><em>Real-time double-difference seismic monitoring</em></strong><em>.</em> This session will introduce a new real-time procedure that employs double-difference and cross-correlation algorithms in a seismic monitoring context. Institute materials will include strategies for building a relational seismic data archive, procedures for large-scale earthquake catalog relocation, evaluation of real-time performance and location precision. This will be illustrated using an operational prototype system for high-precision relocation of earthquakes in Northern California using near-real-time seismic data feeds. Discussions and lecturer assistance will be aimed at evaluating the potential to implement these new techniques into the operational procedures of seismic networks in South East Asia.</p> <p><strong><em>Event locations and tomography</em></strong><em>.</em> A final session will cover the fundamentals of 3D tomography and use of code for conventional 3D tomography (simul2000) and code for double-difference 3D tomography (tomoDD). During the hands-on session, a sample data set is used for software training. In addition, participants can bring their own data sets and obtain one-on-one assistance in analyzing it from the lecturer.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Sponsors: </strong>IRIS IDS with support from the NSF</p> <p><strong>Host: </strong>Thai Meteorological Department </p> <p><strong>Participation</strong> </p> <p>Individuals participating in the IRIS Metadata Workshop are invited to attend.</p> <p>The IRIS DMS will arrange hotels room and air tickets. Participants will be asked to share a hotel room with one other participant. Upgrades to a single room are possible, but participants would be responsible for the cost difference. </p> <p><strong>Visas and entry requirements will need to be arranged by the participant.</strong> </p> <p>Letters of Invitation will be sent by the Thai Meteorological Department. </p> <p><strong>Financial Support</strong></p> <p>There will be no registration fee to participate in this Advanced Studies Institute. Financial support is available from IRIS and will include hotel accommodation through January 16 (double occupancy) and cost of meals, for those participants attending the Metadata Workshop. </p> <p><strong>Dates and Venue</strong></p> <p>January 14-17, 2012<br> Workshop will be held in Bangkok, Thailand.</p> <p>Note: The IRIS Metadata Workshop will be taking place January&nbsp;8-13, prior to this meeting.</p> <p><strong>Registration: </strong> </p> <p><i>Registration closed on August 31, 2011.

        <p><strong>IRIS/PASSCAL</strong><br>
          <strong>Short Course on Portable Broadband Operations</strong>
        
        <p>IRIS will present a 1/2 day short course on portable seismology. This
          course will cover topics related to station design, construction, power
          systems and communications. Experiment operations including servicing
          of stations and maintenance will also be included. Data handling
          and QC will be handled up to the point of delivery of SEED data to
          the data archive.</p>
        <p>This course is designed for anyone interested in conducting portable
          broadband experiments or installing temporary networks. The discussion
          will focus on the experiences of field personnel from the IRIS PASSCAL
          program but will be generalized to cover all types of portable equipment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>IRIS/GSN<br>
		Short Course on Installing and Operating a Regional Broadband Seismic Network</strong></p><p>


IRIS will present a 1/2 day short course covering the installation and operation of a regional broadband seismic network.  This course will cover multiple aspects of site selection, site design, data flow and routine operations and maintenance.  Data transport will be covered up to the point of delivery to the archive.</p><p>

This course is designed for anyone interested in the installation of broadband seismic stations and their incorporation into a regional network.  The presentation will focus on an actual seismic network while being generalized to cover common aspects of station and network installation and maintenance.
