When photography instructor Patrick Navin traveled to Japan with his group of study abroad students, he was prepared to teach them photography in a new country. What he wasn't prepared for, however, was the surge of creativity that would overtake him.

&quot;In terms of photography - I haven't felt so creative in a long time,&quot; explained Navin. &quot;Sometimes I was waking up at 3 a.m. for a nighttime shoot, or I'd be photographing my food during lunch. I was just always making photographs.&quot;

Selected photos of Navin's are featured below; more shots from his time in Japan will be featured in the Helen S. Smith Gallery Sept. 22 through Oct. 30. "></a>
