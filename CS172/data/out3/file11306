         <strong>Bloomsbury, the neighborhood Virginia Woolf called home</strong>. Or write your own masterpiece at the café at Foyles, an epic bookstore on Charing Cross Road.

      <h3>Write to the City</h3> 
      <p>We head into Manhattan to <strong>famous literary hotspots like the 92nd Street Y</strong> to see readings and lectures. And we bring amazing guest writers to Drew to talk with students about writing and publishing. Networking leads to opportunities.</p> 
      <p>Our students go on to a wide variety of successes. Some head for grad school in English, or to creative writing MFA programs. Others go into <strong>law, teaching, digital media or international nongovernment organizations</strong> around the globe.</p> 
      <p>As an English major from a strong liberal arts school you graduate knowing how to read, write and think. These <strong>critical evaluation and communication skills</strong> are valued by all employers in the global marketplace.</p>

               <p>Emphasis in the first part of the course is on expanding and honing strategies for close reading. The course covers accuracy and richness of interpretation, narrative theory, moving beyond the boundaries of the text to other cultural documents, reading drama performatively. By the end of the course, students should understand and be able to use a variety of criteria for judging the legitimacy of their own and others' interpretations. Students will be introduced to a range of ways that scholars work in the field of literary study. Emphases vary depending on instructor.</p>

               <p>This course will provide students with a working knowledge of critical methods in "cultural materialism" and "cultural studies," specifically focusing on Marxist approaches to the criticism of literature and culture. In what sense has Marx's understanding of "ideology" and intellectual production provided modern cultural criticism with new models for understanding the value and function of art, literature, and discourse in relation to the formation of civil society? How have these analytical and theoretical models been complicated and revised in light of key developments in the 20th century, from the rise of mass culture, the emergence of new technologies for the production and dissemination of culture, to more recent shifts in cultural production augmented by transformations in the global political economy?</p>
