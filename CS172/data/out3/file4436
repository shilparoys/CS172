       <p> <a name="Abbott"></a><br> </p>
       <h3>Lynn Abbott – Patron</h3> 
       <p>Lynn Abbott has generously supported Warrior sports for over two decades. Known by Warrior teams as "Mr. Tennis," he financed the construction of four new tennis courts in the 1970’s, the renovation of another two existing courts, and the purchase of spectator seating at the courts, which now bear his name. Lynn’s provision of facilities and scholarships for the Warrior tennis program has contributed greatly to Westmont’s regional and national tennis successes, including the 1982 NAIA Women’s Tennis National Championship and the 1997 NAIA men’s Singles National Championship. In addition to his support of warrior tennis, Lynn has given generously to a variety of other Westmont athletic teams, faithfully attending their competitions and sponsoring end-of-year banquets for them. Inducted October 1997.</p> 
       <p> <a name="Anderson"></a><br> </p>
       <h3>Dwight Anderson – Baseball/Basketball, 1949-53</h3> 
       <p>A great all-around athlete, Dwight ”Andy” Anderson became a legend on the baseball field. As an outfielder, third baseman, pitcher, and catcher, he started for the Warriors each year. Superb on the mound and in the batter’s box, Dwight pitched a one-hitter, captured the MVP award his second year, and maintained a batting average close to .300. He led the team as captain during his senior year, when he also captained the basketball team. Dwight’s versatility as a four-year starter on the basketball court helped him capture the MVP award twice, and Westmont retired his baseball jersey #13 after his final season. Inducted April 1995.</p> 
       <p> <a name="Asimos"></a><br> </p>
       <h3>Sandra Asimos – Women’s Soccer, 1984-87</h3> 
       <p>"Unstoppable," "an architect on the field," "the heart of the team," and "a great teacher" represent just some of the accolades describing forward Sandra Asimos’ prowess on the soccer field. The four-time Warrior MVP proved key in helping her team capture the NAIA National Championship in 1985, when she was named to the All Tournament Team and voted tournament MVP. Also that year, she set Warrior records for most goals in a season (29), most assists in a season (18), and post points in a season (76). A three-time All-American at Westmont (1985, 1986 and 1987), Sandra still holds those records, as well as the records for most career goals (79) and most career points (192), setting the highest of standards for the many women who have followed her as Warrior soccer competitors. Inducted October 1997.</p> 
       <p> <a name="Bakley"></a><br> </p>
       <h3>Bill Bakley – Track &amp; Field, 1971-72</h3> 
       <p>Bill Bakley’s remarkable career included earning All-American honors on three successive weekends in 1971.&nbsp; After placing second at the NAIA decathlon championships Bill entered and won the NCAA college division championship the following weekend.&nbsp; At the NCAA university division championship the next weekend, Bill placed third.&nbsp; His best point total of 7,656 points puts him second in the Warrior record books.&nbsp; Bakley earned a fourth All-American title in 1972 at the NAIA national championship where he beat Bruce Jenner, the 1976 Olympic Champion. Team captain in 1972 and “Solid Gold Guts” award winner, Bakley holds 
        <st1:place w:st="on">
         Westmont
        </st1:place>’s second best long jump mark of 24’ 3”, and is seventh in the pole vault at 14’ 2.25”. Inducted September 2006.</p>
