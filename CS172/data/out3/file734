        <p class="dropcap">As a part of Green River College’s overall plan to improve its facilities and service to students and the communities it serves, the college has developed this Facilities Master Plan (FMP).</p> 
        <p>The completion of the Bleha Center for the Performing Arts, the Technology Center, The Marv Nelson Science Learning Center, Salish Hall and Cedar Hall) along with the Student Life and Trades replacement projects under construction and scheduled for completion in 2015 provided the college the opportunity to redefine a significant portion of the campus.</p> 
        <p>This 2015 master plan update incorporates future renovations, replacement, and growth projects for funding over the next several State of Washington funding cycles. In addition to planning for future development, master planning work has also established conceptual criteria for a variety of campus planning, infrastructure, and environmental topics.</p> 
        <p>The primary goal of this master plan is to provide a tool that will assist Green River with its decisions regarding ongoing and emergent facilities development issues.</p> 
        <p>A framework for an ongoing master plan process is in place that describes participants, a communication plan with biennial reviews and updates as the college plans and facility needs evolve. The <a href="../masterplan/planning-committees"></a>Facilities Master Plan Core Committee facilitates discussions with faculty, staff, administration, students, community members, regulatory agencies, and the Board of Trustees and provides leadership and guidance to maintain a responsive and viable facilities master plan.</p> 
        <p>The committee periodically develops plan revisions that respond to changing needs and create facilities that support evolving institutional goals.</p>

           <h3><a href="about-us/facilities-master-plan.htm#purpose">Purpose</a></h3> 
           <div> 
            <div class="innerDiv"> 
             <p>The capital budget provides funding for all Community and Technical Colleges to maintain and preserve over 15 million square feet of state- owned facilities, upgrade spaces to meet the changing needs of students, local communities and business, and construct new facilities to accommodate growth and accreditation requirements. This document will buttress the College’s bi-annual funding request in the state capital budget process.</p> 
             <p>As part of the budget process, colleges are required to submit capital requests that support their most critical needs. These requests include categories such as repairs, minor improvements, replacements, renovations, and major new construction (growth). The State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) prioritizes these requests and forwards them to the Office of Financial Management (OFM) for consideration by the executive branch. <br>Design and construction funding through the SBCTC system are appropriated on a biennial basis in odd-numbered years by the state legislature.</p> 
             <p>The typical schedule is as follows:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>First Biennium: Design Funding</li> 
              <li>Second Biennium: Construction Funding</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>The process from the decision to request funding to building occupation takes about 6 years.</p> 
             <p>There is significant competition for state funding among applying colleges. It is therefore imperative that this master plan accurately reflects the needs of the college and receives the full support of students, faculty, staff, and the communities we serve, as well as local and state political leaders.</p>

          <h3>Methodology</h3> 
          <p>     </p>
          <p>Successful master planning projects begin with the planning team gaining an understanding of the functions or operations to be performed within the campus. The planning team conducted a series of programming workshops, facility tours, data collection, and observations.</p> 
          <p>The team then examined the college’s strategic plan, instructional and student services plans, International Programs planning efforts, and the facility conditions surveys, to insure that evolving needs are integrated into a long-range plan for facility replacement and growth.</p> 
          <p>That information is documented herein.</p> 
          <p>In January 1, 2008, the City of Auburn annexed the portion of Leah Hill that encompasses the main campus. The annexation provides the college an opportunity to collaborate with the city to address campus issues such as:</p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Sustainable Design/Low Impact Development</li> 
           <li>Campus Entrance/Gateway</li> 
           <li>Traffic (Vehicular and Pedestrian)</li> 
           <li>Circulation/Parking/Wayfinding</li>

              <p>Green River College has a long history of environmental awareness. The design of the recently completed Technology Center and the Marv Nelson Science Learning Center exemplifies the latest efforts to maximize the principles of Green Architecture, the reduction of energy consumption, elimination of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), and maximization of natural lighting systems. Locating both centers on the former track and field minimized the impact on surrounding vegetation. Although a LEEDs (U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification was not a specific goal, the target for both centers was a LEEDs Silver Rating.</p> 
              <p>During the 2005 legislative session, the governor signed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 5509, requiring state-funded projects over 5,000 s/f to be designed, constructed, and certified to at least the LEEDs Silver Rating.</p> 
              <p>Salish Hall completed in summer 2011 is the first project on the main campus to apply for and receive a LEED Silver Certification.</p>

          <p></p>
          <div class="not_expandable"> 
           <p>Green River Master Planning will be a collaborative process that utilizes effective communication to develop capital solutions in response to college needs. Extensive effort will be made to involve campus stakeholders in all master planning efforts through regularly scheduled effective communication with the campus community.</p> 
           <p>Our planning process will be:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Congruent with and supportive of Strategic, Instructional, Student Services, International, and Technology Plans;</li> 
            <li>An evolving process responsive to current information and future trends (Where are we? Where do we want to go? How will we bridge the gap?);</li> 
            <li>Forward-thinking, flexible, and clearly defined.</li> 
           </ul>

              <p>We will create designs that meet the access needs of our patrons and communities. Facilties will be constructed and maintained that incorporate quality, sustainable design elements, enhance the Green River experience, and effectively use space for all campus functions. Regulatory agencies will be included as appropriate in the master planning process.</p>

              <p>Development on campus shall seek to establish a framework of cultural inclusion within which diversity can be expressed. This framework should not seek to impose specific cultural values or images but should offer a backdrop for cultural diversity to find expression by the Green River community.</p> 
              <p>Examples of framework may include:</p> 
              <ul> 
               <li>Providing plaza areas for use by groups for expression such as dance, music, food, theater, etc</li> 
               <li>Designating certain public walkways as “cultural paths” and providing space within the walkway for groups to install culturally specific paving patterns.</li> 
               <li>Establishing an area for a sculpture garden where groups may install sculptures reflecting their communities.</li> 
               <li>Providing space for art which celebrates the cultural diversity experienced on campus.</li> 
              </ul> 
              <p>The intent of these examples is to provide a framework that can accommodate continual expansion and evolution of expressions of diversity. These expressions are works in progress that will be developed by many communities over the life of the college.</p>
