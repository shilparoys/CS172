             <p>Green River Community College’s Practical Nursing Program prepares students for careers as licensed practical nurses.</p> 
             <p>The Practical Nursing Program certificate consists of 95 credits, which includes classroom instruction, campus lab practice, and community lab experiences. Upon successful completion of the program, graduates are eligible to apply for the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses (NCLEX-PN). Passage of this exam is the mechanism by which to receive a license to practice as an LPN.</p> 
             <p>Students must achieve a minimum of 2.5 in each course in order to continue in the program.</p>

             </div> 
             <h4>Licensed Practical Nurses</h4> 
             <p>Licensed Practical Nurses administer medication; monitor equipment; change dressings; feed, bathe, and dress patients; and maintain patient charts. They also assess and monitor the health and illness of clients or patients.</p> 
             <p>In routine nursing situations, LPNs provide safe and efficient nursing care under the supervision of registered nurses or licensed physicians. In more complex situations, LPNs function as assistants to registered nurses. (WAC 18.79.060)</p> 
             <h4>Associate Degree Nurses</h4> 
             <p>It is possible to transfer nursing credits earned at Green River to other colleges or Associate Degree Nursing programs. ADN-RN ladder programs require additional coursework and provide students with basic knowledge of the humanities and the social, physical and biological sciences. The nursing courses include related theory and practice. (WAC 18.79.040)<br> <br> Being a registered nurse means having substantial knowledge, judgment, and skills above the level of the LPN. ADN-RNs function as staff nurses, team leaders or head nurses. <br> <br> <em>Students must check with transfer institutions to make sure they are meeting the requirements for entrance.</em></p> 
             <h4>Employment Outlook</h4> 
             <p>After graduating, students who pass the NCLEX can expect to make $18 to $25 per hour.</p> 
             <p>Employment opportunities from LPNs include:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>In-Patient Care (medical centers, long-term care, mental health facilities)</li> 
              <li>Out-Patient Care (urgent care, clinics, home health/hospice, day surgery centers)</li> 
              <li>Community (schools, detention centers, methadone clinics)</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>Job placement of graduates of the Practical Nursing Program is excellent.</p> 
             <h4>How do I get started?</h4> 
             <p>If you are not a current student of Green River Community College, the first step is to <strong>apply for admission to the college.</strong> Students can apply:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><a href="http://greenriver.edu/student-affairs/apply-now.htm" target="_blank"> Online</a></li> 
              <li>In person at the Main Campus (Zgolinski Welcome Center), Enumclaw Campus or Kent Campus</li> 
              <li>By calling (253) 833-9111, ext. 2500 to request an application via mail.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>After your application to Green River Community College has been received, you will be mailed an acceptance packet. The packet will include your student identification number and a helpful checklist to guide you through the application process. You will still need to apply to the nursing program. <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/Documents/academic-programs/nursing/2015-2016-pn-app.pdf" target="_blank">Download program application</a>.</p> 
             <p>Core classes for the Practical Nursing program begin fall quarter of each school year. Green River begins accepting applications for fall quarter admission to the program in June of the preceding year.</p> 
             <h4>Special Notes</h4> 
             <p>To be licensed, the practical nurse must meet the requirements of the Washington Licensed Practical Nurse Act, Chapter 18.79.060. Green River's Practical Nursing program prepares students to meet these licensing requirements.</p> 
             <p>Application for LPN licensure asks for information regarding legal convictions and drug and alcohol addiction conditions that may inhibit nursing practice. Applicants to the Practical Nursing Program at Green River Community College are required to undergo a complete background check (<a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.43.830" target="_blank">RCW 43.43.830</a> and <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.43.832" target="_blank">RCW 43.43.832</a>) and drug screening.</p> 
             <p>You must have the ability to meet program physical abilities such s do heavy lifting in order to position and maneuver patients, possess good manual dexterity, and be comfortable winking in close proximity to others in order to provide safe and high quality nursing care as outlined in Essential Functions.</p> 
             <p>You must have oral and written fluency in English.</p> 
             <p>You must have your own transportation to and from local clinics up to 60 miles one way, which may include day/evening assignments and non-class days.</p>

            <h3><a href="academics/areas-of-study/details/practical-nursing.htm#">Curriculum concepts</a></h3> 
            <div> 
             <div class="innerDiv"> 
              <p>The content included in the conceptual framework is representative of the mission, values, beliefs and practices of the nursing faculty. The four major paradigm concepts include individual, health, nursing and environment. The nursing paradigm concepts will be traced throughout each course and divided into the progression of the four quarters of the program.</p> 
              <h4>Nursing Process</h4> 
              <p>Nursing process is the scientific problem solving process that uses critical thinking to evaluate situations in order to reach a logical and justifiable plan to meet the healthcare needs of the individual. It is an organized methodology that has five steps and is circular in nature. The steps are assessment, nursing diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation. It begins with assessment followed by a nursing diagnosis that is the identification of a real or potential problem. Next a plan for solving the problem is developed then implemented followed by an evaluation of how successful the plan was. If not successful the process keeps going until an acceptable solution is reached.</p> 
              <h4>Developmental Stages</h4> 
              <p>Professional role involves a commitment to the profession of nursing, a commitment to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the regulating and professional organizations and to demonstrate an appreciation for the values of the nursing profession, to incorporate into the professional career a life-long learning concept and a commitment to maintaining a strong knowledge base in the ever-changing environment of the healthcare field. It defines the characteristics unique to all professions and is further defined by “Law Relating to Nursing Care and Regulation of Health Professions for the State of Washington.”</p> 
              <h4>Nursing Process</h4> 
              <p>Erickson describes the physical, psychological and emotional tasks for each of the eight developmental stages of each individual. This coupled with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs forms the bases for assessing a person’s needs and abilities. The degree of success accomplished as one progresses through the stages identified by Erickson and the further from the primitive needs identified by Maslow the easier it is for individuals to cope with the stress related to healthcare issues for individuals or their significant others.</p> 
              <h4>Communication</h4> 
              <p>Communication is a dynamic process of information exchange utilizing both verbal and non-verbal modes. Therapeutic communication skills are utilized to transmit relevant, accurate and complete information in a concise and clear manner. It demonstrates knowledge, caring and cultural awareness and is directed toward the promotion of positive health outcomes and the establishment of therapeutic relationships.</p> 
              <h4>Safety</h4> 
              <p>Safety includes all behaviors that ensure the well-being of self and others. It begins with the assessment of one’s own needs in order to attain maximum physical and emotional well-being and progresses to well-being of the environment and that of other individuals.</p> 
              <h4>Teaching and Learning</h4> 
              <p>Teaching and learning are processes by which information is shared between and among individuals. The goal of educating individuals is to facilitate informed decision making, to expand knowledge and to change behaviors. Concepts should be introduced from simple to complex and should have the ability to be applied to specific situations.</p> 
              <h4>Caring</h4> 
              <p>Caring encompasses those behaviors that demonstrate a genuine concern for another individual. A demeanor that is sensitive to another’s real and potential needs and performing nursing care in a safe and effective manner that transmits a consistent caring presence while treating the individual with respect and dignity. It denotes a personal sense of commitment to and responsibility for the individual, the family or the community that one serves.</p> 
              <h4>Cultural Awareness</h4> 
              <p>Cultural awareness is the act of recognizing and respecting the importance of cultural differences. Culturally competent nursing care is defined as being sensitive to issues related to culture, race, sexual orientation, social class and economic factors.</p> 
              <p>The people of our community college district can be seen as a tapestry woven of many. The faculty has a strong belief in cultural awareness and sensitivity strands. Our culturally competent care will be defined as being sensitive to issues related to culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, social class, and economic factors. Students and faculty will be asked to examine their own cultural values, beliefs, and cross cultural communications styles. Students and faculty will be asked to study cultural diversity concepts and apply them both within the classroom and in their practice in the community lab setting.</p>

                <h4>Assessment of Current Health Status</h4> 
                <p>Assessment of your health status via a physical examination is to be performed by a healthcare professional (no older than six months prior to enrollment) and documented by your healthcare provider. A fitness exam is not required for the nursing programs. The healthcare provider must be able to document that no health conditions (including previous physical injuries) are present that will create any type of limitation in the ability to provide health care and have the capability of meeting the program's physical requirements.</p> 
                <h4>Immunizations</h4> 
                <p>Students are required to provide compliance with all <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/Documents/academic-programs/nursing/passport-07-17-2014.pdf" title="Immunization Requirements" target="_blank">immunization requirements</a> of the program.
