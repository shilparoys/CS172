               <h4>Krish Mahadevan<br><em>IT Faculty</em></h4>

He has an extensive background in electrical/mechanical/<br>automotive/maritime engineering, having worked at Ford Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan and at Cummins, Inc., Charleston, SC. His specialty lies in inter-module communications and real-time embedded programming. His interest in teaching began when he was at Ford Motor Company helping colleagues in their education when they were getting their degrees. He had always been teaching in some shape or form ever since mostly part-time from his home.</p> 
               <p>Krish strongly believes in molding young minds in the STEM fields, especially in Math, Physics, IT and Computer Science. He trains high school students with their Advanced Placement (AP) in STEM areas from his home on the weekends. He keeps himself busy by reading a lot on new technologies just to keep his brain from rusting!</p> 
               <p>For fun, Krish loves to play with his dogs - a shepherd and a retriever. He is tree hugger and loves plants and trees. His favorite pastime is to restore the plants his dogs dig up. Every day, he takes a few moments to listen to the chirping of his cockatiels (too many to name them here!) and takes peace in just watching his Koi fish, Moby, swim in the fish tank, or meditating. His plan for this summer is to create a small vegetable and a flower garden in his backyard.</p>
