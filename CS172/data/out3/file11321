          No matter what your goal—acting, writing, technical production—you’ll be ready to collaborate because 
         <strong>we immerse you in all aspects of theatre</strong>. Writers must understand acting. To direct you need to understand the person at the sound board, the light board. It helps artistically and on your résumé.

          There’s a 
         <strong>revolving door between London and our department</strong>. We had half our department recently on Drew’s London Semester. Students come back bursting with enthusiasm. Then they grab their friends and go to New York, Philly and Boston to see London-based shows. It enriches everybody’s work.

          Theatre is social by nature. It’s based on relationships. You’re spending six nights a week for months working right next to each other. We know how to resolve problems and work together well. These are 
         <strong>great life skills</strong>, not just for those in the arts.

      <h2>Careers Made easy</h2> 
      <h3>on cue</h3> 
      <p>We encourage you to wear as many hats as possible while you’re with us. You’ll graduate with skills in areas such as lighting, sound, stage design, writing—as well as performance. This flexibility can <strong>help you get those first opportunities</strong>.</p> 
      <p>Our majors take advantage of <strong>enriching internships near and far</strong>. Local opportunities include the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, a top professional company located right on our campus. Majors also intern in New York, Boston, Chicago, sometimes with fellowship assistance to help pay the way.</p> 
      <p>Our networking event, The Big Schmooze, is a chance for prominent graduates to come back and talk about life after Drew. There’s some noshing, some schmoozing, people exchange cards and phone numbers—<strong>lots of great connections</strong>. Even well-established alumni 10 to 15 years out are eager to help current students.</p>

               <p>Under the premise that all theatre has a political dimension and works its influence on audiences both overtly and subversively, this course is designed to take advantage of the huge variety of productions available in London venues (not necessarily conventional theatre spaces), with a focus on the political questions they raise for twenty-first century audiences. Because the 1960s saw big changes on the theatrical scene in Britain it is taken as a starting point, and we see what we can of the playwrights who helped form our present day theatre through the twentieth century. Because it does not operate in a vacuum, appropriate plays may be chosen from other periods and cultures that address crucial global, social and political issues.</p>
