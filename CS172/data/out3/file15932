           <p><b> March 2: Papercuts Exhibition<span class="eventcomma" style="display:inline">: </span></b> </p>
           <p>Born in Australia, France, Czech Republic, Canada and the United States, the artists (Jaq Belcher, Beatrice Coron, Michelle Forsyth, Reni Gower, Lenka Konopasek, Lauren Scanlon, and Daniella Woolf) bring a broad range of international perspectives to the contemporary art of papercutting. Using all manner of tools and paper, the artists create works that range from narrative commentaries to complex structural abstractions. Their works are bold contemporary statements that celebrate the subtle nuance of the artist&#x2019;s hand through a process that traces its origins to 6<sup>th</sup> century China. Light, shadow and color play key roles, transforming this ancient technique into dynamic installations filled with delicate illusions.</p> 
           <p>Narrative metaphor and transformative time infuse all the works. Whether manifested as silhouettes, romanticized fictions, enigmatic reenactments, cryptic scripts or poetic abstractions, the artists address historical, cultural, and personal identity. By encrypting their content with obsessive labor intensive processes (cutting, rolling, punching, folding, pinning) the artists submerge themselves and their viewers in a meditative and liberating experience.</p> 
           <p><strong>Please join us for the exhibit, which runs from March 2, 2015 to April 10, 2015 in the Duke Hall Gallery of Fine Art.</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>The artist lecture will take place in the Duke Hall Gallery on March 2 from 5-6 pm and is immediately followed by the opening reception from 6-7:30 pm.</strong></p>

           <p>Field-Portable Optical Spectrometer Demonstration</p> 
           <p>David Hatchell<br> ASD/PANalytical</p> 
           <p>Monday the <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> of March</strong> David Hatchell from ASD/PANalytical (<a href="http://www.asdi.com">www.asdi.com</a>) will be demonstrating field-portable optical spectrometers. He will be giving a talk (<strong>3:30 in Memorial 7355</strong>) on the science behind the spectrometer and its growing application.&nbsp;</p> 
           <p>From 2:30-3:20 PM, David will be in Rm. 7355 so that we can come in with a rock/mineral sample for spectral analysis.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>What does the spectrometer do?</strong></p> 
           <p>Spectral reflectance of rocks, rock surfaces, and soils in the wavelength region 350 nanometers to 2500 nanometers has been shown to be related to minerals in the samples.&nbsp; The reflectance spectrum of one mineral is often sufficiently different from the reflectance spectrum of another mineral so as to be useful in predicting the minerals in a sample.&nbsp; Accordingly, maps of minerals predicted by spectral reflectance have been useful in studying exploration sites and sites of other geological importance.&nbsp; Field spectral reflectance data have also been used in detecting minerals of interest in production studies, such as predicting clays that cause issues with wall stability and flotation and leaching circuits, and predicting minerals that cause waste dump pH fluctuations that could lead to environmental concerns.</p> 2:30-5:00 PM

           <p>Drs. Mary Thompson and Brooks Hefner, both associate professors of English at JMU, join the program. Thompson says that two kinds of books, mommy memoirs and mother-daughter memoirs, are tackling the tough topic of abortion in new ways. And, during the 1910s and 1920s, the question of whether one was &#x201c;highbrow&#x201d; or &#x201c;lowbrow&#x201d; became a concern in the minds of modernist Americans. Hefner says this &#x201c;brow anxiety&#x201d; dominated the career of Willard Huntington Wright, who fancied himself an intellectual aristocrat while secretly writing a series of wildly popular detective stories under the pseudonym S.S. Van Dine.</p>

           <p><strong>Session:</strong> 1 of 5</p> 
           <p><strong>Workshop Description:</strong> The barrage of information coming at us from multiple sources (e.g., texts, email, tweets, blogs, and alerts), coupled with the demands of our careers, are overwhelming and distracting. The sheer volume of information threatens our ability to think clearly and make wise decisions about what&#x2019;s important. If we react to these stimuli without clear discernment, we fail to accomplish the goals that matter most in our professional and personal lives.</p> 
           <p>FranklinCovey&#x2019;s The <em>5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity</em> solution inspires participants to apply a process that will dramatically increase their ability to achieve life&#x2019;s most important outcomes. Supported by science and years of experience, this solution not only produces a measurable increase in productivity, but also provides a renewed sense of engagement and accomplishment.</p> 
           <p><em>&#x201c;Extraordinary productivity is not about doing more. In fact, it&#x2019;s about doing less. Most of us try to do too much, and as a result we give less than our best and finest effort to those few things that really matter.&#x201d;</em> ~ The 5 Choices to Extraordinary productivity</p> 
           <p><strong>This Multi-Session workshop will include:</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>Choice 1: Act on the Important</strong><br> After this section, participants will use common language and skill-set for determining the difference between important, less important, and unimportant investments of time and energy.</p> 
           <p><strong>Choice 2: Go for the Extraordinary</strong><br> After this section, participants will be able to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Redefine their key roles as transformational rather than functional, an essential condition for achieving extraordinary productivity.</li> 
            <li>Set goals to ensure fulfillment of their key roles.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p><strong>Choice 3: Schedule the Big Rocks</strong><br> <br> <strong>Choice 4: Rule Your Technology</strong><br> After this section, participants will be able to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Align their technological tools &#x2013; computer, smartphone, etc. &#x2013; into one system to serve their productivity needs.</li> 
            <li>Make &#x201c;3 Master Moves&#x201d; to prevent information overload that hampers productivity.</li> 
           </ul>

           <p><strong>Workshop Description:</strong> "I've got to go to a meeting" is a phrase that makes most people's hearts sink. It echoes with boredom, frustration and a general waste of time. And yet we all know we need meetings to discuss problems, share ideas and make decisions. Good meetings send everyone off with a sense of purpose and a feeling of accomplishment. Bad meetings leave attendees de-motivated, irritated and alienated.</p> 
           <p>Now for the really depressing part; people who run meetings badly don't improve with experience. Even worse, people who attend poorly run meetings pick up bad meeting habits. Many people genuinely don't realize they are making a mess of meetings. They aren't even aware that running meetings is a teachable, learnable skill.</p> 
           <p>In this workshop participants will:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Learn five key meeting elements</li> 
            <li>Identify specific strengths and weaknesses of their own meetings at work</li> 
            <li>Recognize the characteristics of a good meeting</li> 
            <li>Learn how to prepare for, structure and control effective meetings</li> 
            <li>Devise an action plan to improve their ability to run good face to face and online meetings</li>

           <p><strong>Location:</strong> All sessions except Session 4 will be held in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jmu.edu/directory/buildings/WP.shtml" title="Wine Price Building Location">Wine Price Building</a> on the 3rd Floor.<strong>&nbsp; Session 4 will meet in JMAC4, IT Training Center</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>Session:</strong> 2 of 5</p> 
           <p><strong>Workshop Description:</strong> The barrage of information coming at us from multiple sources (e.g., texts, email, tweets, blogs, and alerts), coupled with the demands of our careers, are overwhelming and distracting. The sheer volume of information threatens our ability to think clearly and make wise decisions about what&#x2019;s important. If we react to these stimuli without clear discernment, we fail to accomplish the goals that matter most in our professional and personal lives.</p> 
           <p>FranklinCovey&#x2019;s The <em>5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity</em> solution inspires participants to apply a process that will dramatically increase their ability to achieve life&#x2019;s most important outcomes. Supported by science and years of experience, this solution not only produces a measurable increase in productivity, but also provides a renewed sense of engagement and accomplishment.</p> 
           <p><em>&#x201c;Extraordinary productivity is not about doing more. In fact, it&#x2019;s about doing less. Most of us try to do too much, and as a result we give less than our best and finest effort to those few things that really matter.&#x201d;</em> ~ The 5 Choices to Extraordinary productivity</p> 
           <p><strong>This Multi-Session workshop will include:</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>Choice 1: Act on the Important</strong><br> After this section, participants will use common language and skill-set for determining the difference between important, less important, and unimportant investments of time and energy.</p> 
           <p><strong>Choice 2: Go for the Extraordinary</strong><br> After this section, participants will be able to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Redefine their key roles as transformational rather than functional, an essential condition for achieving extraordinary productivity.</li> 
            <li>Set goals to ensure fulfillment of their key roles.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p><strong>Choice 3: Schedule the Big Rocks</strong><br> <br> <strong>Choice 4: Rule Your Technology</strong><br> After this section, participants will be able to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Align their technological tools &#x2013; computer, smartphone, etc. &#x2013; into one system to serve their productivity needs.</li> 
            <li>Make &#x201c;3 Master Moves&#x201d; to prevent information overload that hampers productivity.</li>

           <p><strong>Workshop Description:</strong> We've all worked with someone who makes work impossible. From chronic complainers to idea-stealers, boundary pushers to just plain jerks, a toxic co-worker can ruin your day - and your life! The amount of time spent worrying, avoiding, raging and obsessing over toxic employees can affect performance on the job and peace at home. But it doesn't have to be that way. This workshop will explore how employees and managers can tame a toxic co-worker by setting boundaries.</p> 
           <p>In this workshop, participants will:<br> &#x2022; Identify the role you may play in contributing to the toxic relationships you encounter<br> &#x2022; Learn to identify toxic relationships and boundary busters<br> &#x2022; Learn a 4-Step process that helps reduce or eliminate difficult workplace interpersonal situations</p>

           <p><b> March 20: Book Discussion: Bully in the Ivory Tower<span class="eventcomma" style="display:inline">: </span></b> </p>
           <h3><em>Bully in the Ivory Tower: How Aggression and Incivility Erode American Higher Education</em></h3> 
           <p><span>Several studies have examined workplace bullying in the general population or in the K-12 student population. This book examines the manifestation of workplace bullying in American Higher Education Administration. After surveying over 175 four-year colleges and universities in an independent study, Hollis confirms that workplace bullying occurs at alarming rates in higher education. Further, this study calculates the cost of employee disengagement. Staff who have been bullied either seek to separate from an institution or mentally "check out" as a way of enduring a bully. In the midst of souring tuition costs, no organization can afford the millions of dollars lost to employee disengagement due to a bully. After gathering data through surveys and several interviews with administrators in higher education, Hollis develops a model for a healthy workplace specifically for higher education, which is also applicable to the general population. The model offers solutions for the leadership and organizational level, middle managers, and for the bullies who are seeking healthier management strategies. While this book is an academic study, the writing is accessible, reflects on popular culture at times, and considers the urgency of workplace bullying in relationship to cost, potential accreditation issues, and the personal anguish of the target. The findings and solutions are appropriate for executive leadership, middle management or anyone working in higher education.</span></p> 
           <p>This book is written by Dr. Leah P. Hollis, the Madison Caucus' 2014 Dominion Lecturer, and is available for purchase <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bully-Ivory-Tower-Aggression-Incivility/dp/0988478226">here</a>.</p>

           <p><b> March 20: Japan's Lessons for China<span class="eventcomma" style="display:inline">: </span></b> </p>
           <h3>A lecture presented by Professor Michael J. Smitka<br> Washington and Lee University<br> Taylor 405<br> Refreshments provided</h3> 
           <p>China can learn much from Japan&#x2019;s economic experience. In China most farmers now receive modest cash subsidies; in Japan subsidies did not stay small, and have proven costly to both consumers and the government yet ineffective in making agriculture sustainable. China has a large, unregulated &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; finance sector that undermines monetary stability; in its process of financial deepening Japan successfully transformed that sector into formal financial institutions. The rapid drop in Chinese fertility will lead to an aging population; Japan&#x2019;s demographic transition began in 1950, and its baby boomers have already hit retirement age. China can learn from that as it develops its own pension and healthcare systems. Finally, Japan&#x2019;s transition from high to low growth has not gone well. Understanding what took place could help China avoid making the same mistakes as its own growth slows.&nbsp;</p> 
           <p>Dr. Michael Smitka is a professor of economics at Washington &amp; Lee University. His specialty is in East Asia, and he has written on the Japanese automobile industry as well as other subjects.</p> 
           <p><strong>Parking will be available in the C4 Lot and the Grace Street Parking Deck.

           <p><b> March 20: Japan's Lessons for China<span class="eventcomma" style="display:inline">: </span></b> </p>
           <h3>A lecture presented by Professor Michael J. Smitka<br> Washington and Lee University<br> Taylor 405<br> Refreshments provided</h3> 
           <p>China can learn much from Japan&#x2019;s economic experience. In China most farmers now receive modest cash subsidies; in Japan subsidies did not stay small, and have proven costly to both consumers and the government yet ineffective in making agriculture sustainable. China has a large, unregulated &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; finance sector that undermines monetary stability; in its process of financial deepening Japan successfully transformed that sector into formal financial institutions. The rapid drop in Chinese fertility will lead to an aging population; Japan&#x2019;s demographic transition began in 1950, and its baby boomers have already hit retirement age. China can learn from that as it develops its own pension and healthcare systems. Finally, Japan&#x2019;s transition from high to low growth has not gone well. Understanding what took place could help China avoid making the same mistakes as its own growth slows.&nbsp;</p> 
           <p>Dr. Michael Smitka is a professor of economics at Washington &amp; Lee University. His specialty is in East Asia, and he has written on the Japanese automobile industry as well as other subjects.</p>

           <p><b> March 25: 5 Choices (TD1699)<span class="eventcomma" style="display:inline">: </span></b> </p>
           <p><strong>Location:</strong> All sessions except Session 4 will be held in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jmu.edu/directory/buildings/WP.shtml" title="Wine Price Building Location">Wine Price Building</a> on the 3rd Floor.<strong>&nbsp; Session 4 will meet in JMAC4, IT Training Center</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>Session:</strong> 3 of 5</p> 
           <p><strong>Workshop Description:</strong> The barrage of information coming at us from multiple sources (e.g., texts, email, tweets, blogs, and alerts), coupled with the demands of our careers, are overwhelming and distracting. The sheer volume of information threatens our ability to think clearly and make wise decisions about what&#x2019;s important. If we react to these stimuli without clear discernment, we fail to accomplish the goals that matter most in our professional and personal lives.</p> 
           <p>FranklinCovey&#x2019;s The <em>5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity</em> solution inspires participants to apply a process that will dramatically increase their ability to achieve life&#x2019;s most important outcomes. Supported by science and years of experience, this solution not only produces a measurable increase in productivity, but also provides a renewed sense of engagement and accomplishment.</p> 
           <p><em>&#x201c;Extraordinary productivity is not about doing more. In fact, it&#x2019;s about doing less. Most of us try to do too much, and as a result we give less than our best and finest effort to those few things that really matter.&#x201d;</em> ~ The 5 Choices to Extraordinary productivity</p> 
           <p><strong>This Multi-Session workshop will include:</strong></p> 
           <p><strong>Choice 1: Act on the Important</strong><br> After this section, participants will use common language and skill-set for determining the difference between important, less important, and unimportant investments of time and energy.</p> 
           <p><strong>Choice 2: Go for the Extraordinary</strong><br> After this section, participants will be able to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Redefine their key roles as transformational rather than functional, an essential condition for achieving extraordinary productivity.</li> 
            <li>Set goals to ensure fulfillment of their key roles.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p><strong>Choice 3: Schedule the Big Rocks</strong><br> <br> <strong>Choice 4: Rule Your Technology</strong><br> After this section, participants will be able to:</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Align their technological tools &#x2013; computer, smartphone, etc. &#x2013; into one system to serve their productivity needs.</li> 
            <li>Make &#x201c;3 Master Moves&#x201d; to prevent information overload that hampers productivity.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <p><strong>Choice 5: Fuel Your Fire</strong></p> 
           <p>After this section, participants will be able to recharge their physical and mental energy levels continuously to increase their productivity.</p>

A facilitative team leader can facilitate team members to set the team&#x2019;s goals, lay out plans to achieve those goals, make important decisions along the way, assign roles and responsibilities, solve problems, and evaluate the progress of the team.</p> 
           <p>In this session participants will:</p>

           <p><span>Miss Israel Linor Abargil was abducted, stabbed, and raped in Milan, Italy, at age 18. She had to represent her country in the Miss World competition only six weeks later. When to her shock she was crowned the winner, she vowed to do something about rape. The film follows her from the rape, to her crowning and through her crusade to fight for justice and break the silence. During her travels to speak out and meet with other rape victims, her own trauma begins to resurface. Her serial rapist becomes eligible for parole, and she has to hunt down his previous victims in order to help keep him behind bars. The film explores the trauma of sexual assault through one young woman&#x2019;s journey from teenage rape victim to Miss World to empowered lawyer and activist.</span></p>

            <p><strong>"Right? Wrong? Ethical?"</strong></p> 
            <p>This is the theme of the <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/international/islc/index.shtml" target="_blank" title="ISLC Link">2015 International Student Leadership Conference</a> where 250 or so participants gather from approximately 65 countries and 23 institutions.</p> 
            <p>Being an ethical leader sometimes means having to take actions that are inconvenient and unpopular, but an ethical leader is always one who sees the interconnectedness of individuals, cultures, experiences and passions by implementing multidisciplinary solutions to address complex problems. An ethical leader thinks outside of the box, and relies on others to obtain different perspectives and solutions by trusting and empowering them.</p>

           <p><strong>Workshop Description:</strong> &#x201c;I want to engage my audience,&#x201d; is what most who have audiences are expressing. Many people in your audience are tired - at least a third of them just don&#x2019;t get enough sleep. If not tired, they are used to being continuously engaged by modern technologies: smart phones, Netflix, and social media. Part of your job is to help them stay awake, pay attention, participate in the discussion, and think about what you are saying. No longer will training participants accept speakers talking AT them; they want to be part of the conversation.</p> 
           <strong>In this workshop, participants will:</strong> 
           <ul> 
            <li>Learn how to create a safe learning environment for workshop participants</li> 
            <li> <p>Explore appropriate strategies to keep workshop participants engaged</p> </li>
