In 2010, HKT returns to North America for the first time since 1996. The 25<sup>th</sup> International Workshop will be held from 7-10<sup>th</sup> June at San Francisco State University, California - please mark your calendar and plan to attend! Following the format of previous workshops, thematic oral and poster sessions will occur within a single venue to avoid the distraction of parallel sessions.<br> <br> All workshop updates will appear on this web site as soon as they are available.

Participants who wish to stay at the Travelodge the night of Friday, June 4, should make reservations directly with the hotel. This hotel offers free transport from San Francisco International Airport and a complimentary continental breakfast.<br> <br> The HKT Fieldtrip will examine world-class examples of the Franciscan accretionary complex, Coast Range ophiolite and Great Valley Group deep sea deposits. The stops on this three day trip will provide an excellent forum for discussion of convergent and accretionary tectonic processes, and examination of several tectonic controversies surrounding these rocks. There will be ample discussion of the whole of the convergent margin, spanning the Sierra Nevada magmatic arc, Great Valley forearc, and Coast Range accretionary assemblage. Additional stops on the last day will highlight the younger transform margin associated with the San Andreas fault. The fieldtrip will be lead by two leading experts on the geology of the Coast Ranges and northern California: John Shervais, Utah State University, and Todd Greene, California State University Chico, along with Brad Ritts, Chevron Energy Technology Company.<br> <br> The field trip will depart from San Francisco and on day 1 will travel northward to examine the Stonyford Volcanic Complex and Coast Range Ophiolite, as well as several stops in Franciscan accretionary assemblage rocks. The second day will focus on deep water sedimentary deposits of the Great Valley Group forearc basin, one of the thickest and best preserved forearc successions in the geologic record. These rocks will range from mud-rich sections to conglomerates and will represent a range of channelized and non-channelized depositional environments within canyons, slope channels, and fans. There will be opportunities on both evenings to discuss the geological controls on the wine-producing qualities of the Napa Valley and surrounding regions. Day three will consist of classic localities for Franciscan melange in the northern San Francisco bay region and Marin headlands, as well as an opportunity to view, and cross, the San Andreas fault and examine effects of the 1906 earthquake. Time permitting, travel to Pt. Reyes to examine Salinian block sedimentary rocks will be included. Following the final geological stop of the third day, participants will return to SF State in time to check-in to on-campus housing and for the icebreaker Monday evening June 7th.<br> <br> Advance registration and payment are required by the March 1st deadline. Field trip registration includes a field guide, transportation, accommodation, and breakfasts (Sun./Mon.) and lunches (Sat./Sun./Mon.); dinners are separate and to be arranged individually by field trip participants.<br> <br>
