        This course will trace the way in which the history and culture of Ireland have been represented in visual images from 1800 to the present day. The main representations will be films, photographs, cartoons and wall murals.The course will examine how these images have been used to reinforce nationalist and unionist, Catholic and Protestant caricatures, both within Ireland and elsewhere. it will also explore the emergence of cultural stereotyping, which has ranged from affectionate views of "paddy" (drunk, stupid, but loveable) to more sinister ones (dangerous, furtive, violent). Other visual stereotypes will also be examined, such as images of 'the west' (spiritual, mystical, unspoilt) compared with images of 'the north' (dark, unknown,threatening). Be prepared to challenge these and other stereotypes.

        The modernist period in literature was one which concerned itself with the problem of knowledge. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the certainty of the Victorian sages gave way to a questioning of certain systems of faith (religion, science, nationalism, imperialism, etc.) that had not only been accepted as truth, but were also crucial to the construct of British modernity. Reading a handful of novelists who have become (to some extent) definitive of British modernism, this course seeks to identify specific preoccupations of the period and how those preoccupations impact narrative voice and structure. In doing so, students explore how modernist plots remap different fields of knowledge. Texts include works by Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, and James Joyce.

Readings span the disciplines of history, psychology, literature, theology, and political science, each providing its own distinctive illumination as presented by a faculty member within the discipline, who lectures and participates at appointed sessions in interdisciplinary discussions. Course requirements include papers, journal entries, and a field trip to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.

        This course examines mystical literature in verse form as it arises in different religious traditions from around the world. We ask why mystical revelations are so frequently expressed in poetry, and why many poets lean towards a mystical approach in their verse. The texts span the centuries from the Song of Solomon to Rumi, from zen poets to Emily Dickinson, Hart Crane and Seamus Heaney. Students are encouraged to develop their own definitions of mystical poetry and their own explanations for its appearance throughout the ages.

        Taught by an Arts and Letters faculty member and faculty from the County College of Morris, this course focuses on cultures, missions, and practices of teaching in community colleges, especially in New Jersey. The Drew/CCM teaching team will introduce participants to central issues of teaching and learning in the community college sector of higher education. The course will explore the unique characteristics of community college students as well as the mission and history of the colleges. In terms of issues which present themselves, the course will consider the role of general education requirements, assessment, distance education, and the changing nature of the collective bargaining environment. Finally, the course will focus on practical issues: career transitions, syllabus design, writing courses and pedagogy, and the development of ones own teaching ethic as a potential faculty member.

        This entry seminar introduces D.Litt. students to the work of multiple disciplines in the Arts and Letters Program. It produces initial familiarity with fields of humanistic inquiry from among the program's seven concentrations: Historical Studies; Literary Studies; Global Studies; Studies in Spirituality; Irish/Irish American Studies; Fine Arts and Media Studies; and Writing. The seminar features a team of professors from several fields of study and practice taught in the CSGS, each of whom leads the seminar for two weeks. Through broad discussion and specific readings and assignments, classes preview what the individual disciplines "do" in our time. Students participate in the weekly conversations and write six short papers. The goal is to ground and enable each student's broad choices for D.Litt. work, from taking courses to conceiving the doctoral dissertation.

Novels and short stories that criticize and/or satirize the role of clergy and the church will be a particular focus, but we will also take a look at literature that seeks to present new or alternative visions of spirituality. In addition to works of high literary value, such as Nathaniel Hawthornes A Scarlet Letter, we also study 19th century popular novels such as like Elizabeth Phelps The Gates Ajar and the recent bestseller Left Behind by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins.

Our central questions will be: What does it mean to teach effectively in a particular discipline as well as across al disciplines? What are the appropriate and effective ways of teaching in academic settings? Particular attention will be paid to developing sound practices for such issues as: syllabus design, student assessment and grading, student-teacher-subject relations, student diversity, leading a discussion, crafting lectuer, etc. This course is not required, but is recommended for those students who are currently or who are interested in being Teaching Assistants at Drew and who plan to teach in the wider acad

       <dd>
        As writers, teachers, and writing center tutors we face similar questions about the nature of knowledge, learning and thinking, and the process of writing and communicating with others. How does teaching and tutoring writing change our own writing and our understanding of the writing process? How do we develop teaching and tutoring strategies that will work for different situations, students, and writing projects? This course will address four questions: what is a writing consultant, and what is his or her role in higher education? what is knowledge, and how does our concept of knowledge shape our work as writing teachers and tutors? what is learning and how do we assess our efficacy as teachers and tutors? and how do these things inform a writing tutor or teacher's repertoire? The course will combine theories of writing, teaching, and writing center work with practical application through Drew's University Writing Center. Open to all students, the course is strongly recommended for graduate students who plan to teach, undergraduates who hope to attend graduate school and be awarded a teaching assistantship, and writing center tutors who wish to perfect their craft.

        When and why did the United Kingdom come into being? What were the steps which led to its conception? Was the creation of the United Kingdom a symptom of national coherence or of disunity between the countries that made up the Union after 1801? Did a new national identity come into being as a consequence, or did old allegiances and loyalties become more deeply embedded? Who were the beneficiaries of the Union? Was the United Kingdom ever really united? Is the eventual breakup of the reconstituted United Kingdom inevitable? These and other questions will be addressed in this course, which examines the interaction between the component parts of the United Kingdom between 1800 and 2000. A number of key topics will be explored through readings in literature and contemporary social observation, including the steps to political union, the role of economic change, religion and education, poverty and social welfare, the rise of political radicalism, and the changing face of national iden

       <dd>
        In Ireland, history, memory and commemoration have traditionally played a significant role in shaping contemporary political developments. But they have frequently been divisive, with popular (and even academic) memories of the past being constructed in such a way as to serve current ideological ends. Following an introduction to the key issues in Irish history, the course will focus on a number of major historical events, including the founding of the Orange Order in 1795, the republican uprising in 1798, the Great Hunger of 1845-50, and the Easter Uprising in 1916. These events will be explored in the context of how memory and commemoration have been utilized by different religious and political traditions. The involvement of the Irish diaspora in this process, particularly in the United States and Britain, will also be explored. The course will examine traditional and nontraditional sources such as songs, wall murals, and films. Where appropriate, the Irish experience will be co

        Visual representations of Ireland have had a significant role in shaping views of the Irish in both positive and negative ways. They have also been divisive, with popular images and caricatures being used to serve particular ideological or social ends. Yet visual images have often been underused as a research tool by historians. This course will focus on a number of key events in Irish history, including the history of the Orange Order, the 1798 Uprising, the Great Hunger, Irish Emigration, the Easter Rising, and "the Troubles". Each topic will be explored by examining contemporary images, and by assessing how these representations have been utilized over time by different religious and political traditions. The representations of the Irish diapsora, in Britain and in the United States, will also be explored. Students will be encouraged to make use of non-traditional sources such as cartoons, photographs, statues, wall murals, postage stamps, flags, maps, films, and coins. Where ap

       <dd>
        From St. Brigid in the fifth century to President Mary MacAleese in the twenty-first century, women have played pivotal roles in the development of Ireland. Moreover, the large number of emigrant Irish women in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries made their influence felt throughout the world. The remarkable contribution of women to the struggle for Irelands independence was recognized in the 1916 Proclamation, though the 1937 Constitution sought to reassert the primary role of women as wives and mothers. This course will examine and evaluate the contributions of women modern Ireland and ask why their involvement was ignored for so long by Irish historians. It will also assess the role of key figures in the making of Irish history, and will explore the place of women in Ireland today.

        Following its inception in May 1921, politics within the Northern Ireland state was dominated by sectarianism and religious conflict. In order to maintain Protestant hegemony, the civil rights of the minority Catholic population were eroded, both overtly and covertly. Tensions came to a head in the 1960s, but his course will demonstrate how the seeds of violence were sown much earlier. Key events of the conflict such as Bloody Sunday, internment, the murder of Lord Mountbatten, the hunger strikes, the Enniskillen and Omagh bombings, and the steps to the Peace Process will be examined. There will be a special focus on various government enquiries and on accusations of police collusion that have accompanied these investigations. The course will make extensive use of primary evidence.

       <dd>
        In the late nineteenth century, opposition to slavery was spreading in Europe, mostly due to the involvement of dissenters and radicals. French revolutionaries banned slavery within the French Empire after 1789, a decision reversed by Napoleon and then restored in 1848. The British parliament banned the slave trade in 1807 and slavery in 1833: both acts were supported by Irish MPs. After 1833, opponents of slavery in Europe (notably the Irish Catholic Daniel OConnell) increasingly turned their attention to Abolition in America. This course examines anti-slavery agitation in Europe and its connections with American Abolition.

The course raises a fundamental question, "What were the origins and dynamics of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and how has it shaped economic, political, religious, gender and racial identities in the modern world?" Through lectures, discussion, journal writing, book reviews and research in primary documents, students study the nature of global interactions between peoples and cultures through several humanities disciplines such as history, literature and religion. The seminar also focuses on the centrality of Christianity as (1) an incentive and rationale for slavery from the 16th to the 18th centuries; (2) the foundation for moral arguments against slavery in the 19th century; and (3) one of the central components behind cultural change and identity formation for over three centuries.

        1848 marked a watershed in nineteenth-century European political history, despite the fact that many of the uprisings associated with this year were quickly put down. The repercussions of this short-lived revolutionary activity were felt as far away as Australia, Cape Town (South Africa) and in North and South America. This course examines the impact of the 1848 revolutions, placing these political upheavals in the context of other cultural, technological and ideological changes that were taking place, both in Europe and elsewhere.

       <dd>
        In 1921 the British Empire was the largest empire in history, including one-quarter of the world's population. Yet, starting with the loss of the American colonies in the eighteenth century, the history of the British Empire was also a history of multiple struggles to achieve independence by the colonised territories. But independence was often slow to come, and the outcome was sometimes partial and piecemeal, creating fresh problems for the new governments. With special attention to China, India, and Ireland, this course will examine the struggles to win independence from Britain. It will ask why limited Home Rule was granted in some British territories but not in others during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, what steps were taken by the native populations to achieve political independence, how the British state responded to these challenges, what was the longer-term legacy of the British Empire, and what lessons can be drawn by imperial powers in the twenty-first

It focuses on the dramatic challenges to entrenched forms of political, economic, and military power, as well as to hierarchies of race, gender, and class. It explores the meaning of the 1960s as "living history," both by considering representations of the era within popular memory and by employing some of the experimental pedagogy of the 1960s. Key texts include works of history, memoirs, social theory, and literature, as well as films and popular music. Units will cover events in the United States, Europe, and Latin America; the international "language of dissent"; global countercultures; transformations of everyday life; and the question of legacies.

From early gentlemens agreements at the Royal Society to the all-out science wars of the 1990s, and from large macroscale concerns that attempted to relate science to democracy and Marxism (both of which treated science as a distinctive and objective form of knowledge) to later provocative microscale studies that challenged received notions of "truth", "fact" and "scientist" altogether, we will incorporate perspectives from classical sociology, anthropology, epistemology, and literary theory, along with critiques from gender studies and science studies, in an attempt to better un

Topics to be explored include the history of ancient, Arabic, and medieval European science and mathematics; the "Scientific Revolution" and the new uses of mixed mathematics in astronomy and natural philosophy; and the integration of biological and other field sciences with larger colonialist and nationalist projects. We will broaden our understanding of the contributions of various world cultures to the history of science, and explore the ways in which particular local cultural realities make certain kinds of scientific developments possible.

        Medicine has played a crucial role in the way we understand and experience gender and sexuality in the modern era. Recent years have seen the emergence of a growing body of historical literature that addresses these issues, concentrating on such themes as attempts to control sexual behavior, ideas of femininity and masculinity in clinical diagnoses, the "invention" of homosexuality, and the impact of gender on the production of medical knowledge. In this seminar we will explore some of these themes by examining several distinct settings in which modern medicine has helped shape and been shaped by ideas about gender and sexuality.

        From eugenics to bodybuilding, tattooing to anorexia, cosmetic surgery to reproductive technology: in modern times the body has been the site of the most personal and the most political battles. Various experts and historical actors have sought to understand, discipline, and shape it to conform to a variety of agendas. Rather than remaining unchanged over time, the human body (and our experience of it) has evolved in response to such pressures. This seminar explores major themes in the history of the body in the modern Western world. We will probe the myth of the ideal body and explore historical attempts to construct a "normal" body. We will examine a wide range of practices through which individuals have attempted to shape their identities through the reshaping of their bodies. Finally, we will explore the medicalization of the body and the role of science as an authoritative discourse in this process.

We will examine different literatures about popular or "mass"-culture and its supposed effects, its production, and its patterns of consumption, drawing on historical critiques as well as recent analyses of particular genres. The purpose will be to understand the categories of analysis intellectuals have traditionally employed, to examine how those categories have changed over time, and to consider what we have gained intellectually (or politically, or culturally) from the recent expansion of popular culture studies and cultural history, within the humanities and social sciences.

        In the nineteenth century, one out of every four human beings on earth was a subject of Queen Victoria. With the exception of the United States, no nation in history has ever enjoyed the global power, economic dominance, and international cultural influence once exercised by Great Britain. The world as we know it today was shaped very largely by the British Empire. This course surveys the political, social, economic history of modern Britain and its relationship to the larger world. It will cover the rise and fall of British power, industrial society, parliamentary politics, popular culture, "Victorianism" and "modernity", sexuality, the First and Second World Wars, and postindustrial Britain, among other topics.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        No recent decade has been so powerfully transformative in the United States and much of the world as have the 1960s. The era's social movements -- from civil rights, to feminism, youth protest, environmentalism, and nascent conservatism -- dramatically changed the political culture of the developed West. Decolonization struggles, cresting in the 1960s, altered the nature and balance of global power, while, in communist Europe, democracy movements set the stage for full-scale revolutions that ended the Cold War.. So too, no decade has had such an enduring grip on politics, culture, and consciousness. This class explores the 1960s as international history, focusing on global conflicts and protest cultures. Separate units will treat key events, figures, and themes in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, stressing the interconnection between disparate movements and experiences. The course material will range widely to include politics, music, the visual arts, and film.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Since its first discovery and settlement, the United States has fascinated observers from other lands. They have produced a body of literature ranging from the perceptively analytic, as in the case of Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America to the purely imaginative, as in Franz Kafka's novel Amerika, to the witheringly satirical, as in the recent film Borat. Americans, for their part, have been alternately fascinated, indignant, or nonplussed by the "image in the mirror" these foreign observers offer. Employing works from the seventeenth through the twentieth century, this seminar explores the foreign commentary on America and the American response to this commentary. Seminar objectives include developing an understanding of the broad themes that have informed foreign observations of America, the themes and issues animating the American response, and the historical contexts influencing both the production and reception of these observations. We also consider why some commentaries-Tocqueville's Democracy being the prime example-to exert a strong pull on American self image.

        This seminar will address two major aspects of preaching: 1) the theology of preaching as sacramental and 2) preaching on the sacraments. Ancient through post-modern preaching texts will be used to develop a genre of preaching understood as mystagogy, preaching that communicates the mysteries of Christian faith, and the means of grace through which believers encounter the real presence of Christ. Just as a pulpit/ambo is located between the font and the table, this course will focus on preaching as the intersection where "commonplace things are lifted up for holy use". Sermon preparation and evaluation is required as part of the course assignment.

The relations between the varieties of humanism and medicine and the modern split between scientific medicine and humanistic thought will be discussed. The class will also explore whether American society possesses any shared values on which to build a unified community that could frame the historical exploration of humanism and an approach to the medical humanities. A key outcome of the course will be to define medical humanities.

        The hypothesis of this course is that the rich, early literature depicted in children's games, fairy tales, rhymes and stories is the preparatory stage in the development of an adult understanding of our own nonexistence. For example, the game peekaboo (one of the first games played by a child with its parents) becomes one of the earliest building blocks upon which more sophisticated and in-depth notions of life and death may be built. The course will increase the student's awareness of the importance of this category throughout the life cycle of the human person, culminating in one's own nonexistence. The literature of separation loss, object permanency disappearance is extensive and cross-disciplinary. Includes an examination of the works of Bettelheim, Bowlby, and Kubler-Ross.

        Boards of Trustees have major responsibilities to provide effective leadership for nonprofit healthcare organizations.

Conversely, when problems arise, trustees are held accountable. Clearly, a variety of difficult and complex problems exists in todays healthcare environment. Consequently, the responsibility of nonprofit hospital trustees requires planning for and addressing the challenges including contentious ethical issues. Conflicts of interest, executive compensation, medical errors, quality of patient care, and allocation of resources are some of the dilemmas that will be considered and debated. Additionally, the students, as trustees will experience significant power and responsibility, commencing with board orientation and culminating as members of a mock board analyzing and debating issues. The expertise of guest speakers from the industry will complement the readings and class discussionsresponsibility

        The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the history and theory of scientific illustration, both Western and non-Western and the methods for organizing, developing and producing illustrations capable of conveying a message. The course focuses on three main points: the history of medical illustration; the methods of planning and organizing of scientific illustrations, including research, narration of a process, technique; and field trips. Students need not have artistic ability, but are encouraged to think visually and try out some basic skills to better understand the process of moving from concepts to images.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Illness, be it physical, psychical, or spiritual, is defined not by physicians, psychiatrists, or spiritual leaders, but by culture. Its recognition is akin to the process of interpretation in the humanities. This course illustrates and examines these propositions in the reports of patients, physicians, spiritual guides, and literary critics.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        The body has its own symbolic language. This means a communication from the self to the self often found in illness, ticks, hysterical conversions, muscle tightness, backaches, headaches, etc. The body often focuses the internal message, suppressed to the self by the psyche or the intellect. Various writers have attempted to understand this process for the sake of unraveling the meaning of illness. This course integrates a number of medical, spiritual, and psychological points of view. The course investigates the body-mind-spirit connection by turning to writers like Alexander Lowen, Daniel Goleman, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and Aame Siirala.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        The intersection of medicine and science reflects culture, politics, and faith. Does it also intersect with two thousand years of Western philosophy? Or is the utopian Dream of a Theory of Everything epistemological jargon: The fragility of such an ambitious but ethereal theory encompasses a continuum of ideas traced from the era of Greek sages to the present postmodern times. To understand this enduring wisdom, the course presents diverse doctrine supporting the consilience of philosophy, science and the medical humanities. With this approach, we explore origins perceived by the minds and movements in the long history of ieas. The series of seminars emphasizes the correlation between classical studies and empiricism, encouraging scholars to probe thoughts and theories of established philosophies. However, beyond what is provided by an inquiring mind, participants are not required or expected to have a formal background in philosophy. The seminar features contributions of the Greek Godfathers of thought, Descartes' Dualism, science of the Enlightenment, the challenging philosophy of Darwinism, the intellectual chaos of Freudian upheavals, American Pragmatism, Postmodernism in medicine, Existentialism, Feminism, and Sociobiology. Finally, a fixed Canon of the humanities is proposed to broaden and humanize medical education.

        The course is an examination of current public health issues from the perspectives of critical medical anthropology and political ecology. Public health involves taking a population-based approach to health problems with a strong focus on ethical principles and issues of social justice both locally and globally. Within this framework, students analyze a number of problems and policy issues, some provided by the instructor and others that students themselves bring in from recent newspaper or other media sources. Topics may include health hazards of modern food production, behavioral intervention and the rise of obesity and diabetes, national healthcare vs. private insurance, vulnerable populations (e.g., the poor and the elderly), global health issues, disaster management, and rationing health care and vaccines. Analysis of these problems includes evaluating the quality of health information in the mass media and considering how health policy, law, and ethics handle tensions between individual rights and social responsibility. In addition to finding and studying these issues, students complete a research paper in a related area of their choice.

       <dd>
        Naturalistic inquiry, a form of ethnography, is a qualitative research methodology as opposed to the hypothetico-deductive methodology prevalent in the exact sciences of today. The primary research instrument is the interviewer. Basic techniques include in-depth interviewing and prolonged observation within the natural setting of a group. The interviews and observations are recorded in a "thick description," which stays close to the actual experience and avoids theory-laden language. This course will provide instruction in the techniques of naturalistic inquiry for designing the study collecting and analyzing data, validating the results, and writing up a case report. This is a hands-on course where each student will be required to conduct a naturalistic inquiry of his or her own. Ideally, the topic would relate to the student's ultimate thesis or dissertation topic. The course will also provide instruction in using computerized tools to assist in data analysis.

We will conclude with a brief introduction to the disability rights movement of the last generation.

It thus proposes that individual and societal health is achieved by the transformation, and not elimination, of narcissistic behaviors, i.e., the transformation of an immature into a more mature narcissism characterized by creativity, sense of humor, sense of finitude, empathy, and wisdom. It also explores its theoretical implications on the lives of historical figures as well as ethical, pastoral, and theological issues. It works toward developing an ethic/theology of compassion that can address pastoral issues.

This course will draw upon European-American, and African-American intellectual traditions to understand the interplay of theology and psychology. A primary goal of this course is to prepare students to interpret religious experiences using a variety of psychological perspectives in critical dialogue with theological and ethical traditions.

In his 1822 Christian Faith he unfolded a phenomenology of consciousness that fulfilled the Kantian project for religion. Tillich (1886--1965), referring to Schleiermacher as his spiritual grandfather, developed an existential theology in dialogue with contemporary culture and in some respects brought the grand liberal tradition to a high water mark. His major work of 1951-1963, Sytematic Theology Vols. I, II, III, will be the focus of the course's reflections.

       <dd>
        This course consists of an introduction to the basic texts and motifs of the major North East Asian traditions of Confucianism and Daoism, followed by an attempt to bring specific texts, themes, and thinkers into dialogue with Christian theology in order to answer the question: What can Christian theologians learn from Confucianism/Daoism? Students will first read selected primary sources, focusing on the classical figures of Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi, Laozi, and Zhuangzi, and the central themes of Tao, Heaven, ren, ritual, self-cultivation, ziran, and wuwei, and then proceed to examine some examples of Confucian-Christian and/or Daoist-Christian dialogue. Students will also be introduced to methods for the emerging field of comparative theology, notably Robert. C. Neville, Francis X. Clooney, and James Fredericks.
