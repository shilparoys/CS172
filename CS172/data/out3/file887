      <h3>Our chapel is a sanctuary for discourse and diversity</h3> 
      <p>At the center of our worshipping and learning community is Craig Chapel. Deep love goes into chapel, from homemade bread to handmade music, sermons, and services. Deep thought is present, too, as we share, preach, and practice the knowledge we have gained and the questions that remain. Watch it unfold!</p>
