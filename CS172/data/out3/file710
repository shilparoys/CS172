            <p>Disability Support Services (DSS) is here to explore with you appropriate accommodations to make the campus environment accessible and ease your transition to the classroom. Individualized accommodations and support services are provided for wounded warriors. Students work with the DSS Director in a <strong><em>CONFIDENTIAL</em></strong> meeting to develop a <em>Letter of Accommodation</em> (<em>LOA</em>). Please see the procedures for obtaining accommodations and documentation guidelines below.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Veteran's transcripts and records do not identify whether or not a student received accommodations from DSS.</p>

           <div> 
            <p>To be eligible for disability related services, students must have a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and request to be accommodated. Under the <a href="http://www.ada.gov/" title="Link to American with Disabilities Act website" target="_blank">ADA </a>and <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm" title="Link to Department of Labor Section 504 information" target="_blank">Section 504</a>, a person has a disability if s/he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities (e.g., walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, standing, breathing, learning, and working).</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Documentation Guidelines</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Documentation of a disability must be generated by a medical or professional expert in the related field of disability and submitted in writing to Disability Support Services (DSS) where it will be kept in a separate, confidential file.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>Please click on the disability below for Green River documentation guidelines or see our General Guidelines.</strong></em></p>

           </div> 
           <h3>Intake Interview</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Students with disabilities requesting academic accommodations are required to complete an Intake Interview with the Director of Disability Support Services (DSS). Please contact DSS at (253) 833-9111, ext. 2631, or by TDD at: (253) 288-3359 to schedule an appointment. <em><strong>If accommodations (e.g. ASL Interpreters) are needed for the Intake Interview please contact DSS one week prior to the interview. </strong></em></p> 
            <p>The <em>Intake Form</em> can be completed by the student prior to the Intake Interview or it will be completed during the Intake Interview. Please complete the highlighted areas on the Intake Form and bring the form to the Intake Interview.</p> 
            <p>Click <em><strong><a href="Documents/student-affairs/Disability Support Services/intake-form.pdf" title="Link to Intake Form" target="_blank">here</a></strong></em> to access the <em>Intake Form</em>.</p> 
            <p>Please also print and complete the <em>Authorization for Release of Information</em> (<em>ARI</em>) and bring to DSS at time of Intake Interview. The <em>ARI</em> allows DSS to request additional documentation on behalf of a student.</p>

           <h3>Requesting Letters of Accommodation (LOA)</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The <em>Letter of Accommodation</em> (<em>LOA</em>) <em>Request Form</em> must be completed by a <em><strong>qualified and registered student</strong></em> every quarter that they are requesting academic accommodations from Disability Support Services (DSS). Please fill out the <em>LOA Request Form</em> and submit it to DSS. A copy of the class schedule is not required when submitting <em>LOA Request</em> online.</p> 
            <p>Once a student's <em>LOA Request Form</em> has been received by DSS, copies of their <em>LOA</em> will be provided to the student. <strong><em>The</em> <em>student is responsible to give a copy to each instructor.</em></strong> The<em> LOA</em> is not activated until the student discusses the accommodations with his/her instructors. The <em>LOA</em> specifies which accommodations the student has qualified for and are intended to begin communication between the student and his/her instructor.</p> 
            <p>Click <em><strong><a href="Documents/student-affairs/Disability Support Services/loa-request-form.pdf" title="link to Letter of Accommodation Request Form" target="_blank">here</a></strong></em> to access the <em>LOA Request Form</em>.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Student Responsibilities</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Students are responsible for <em><strong>requesting assistance</strong></em> for a disability from Disability Support Services (DSS) and <strong><em>providing</em> </strong>medical documentation that diagnoses the condition and supports requested accommodations.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>Each quarter</strong></em> a student is requesting academic accommodations a <em>Letter of Accommodation</em> (<em>LOA</em>) <em>Request Form</em> needs to be completed by the student and turned into DSS once the student has registered for classes. In turn, DSS will provide the <em>LOA</em> for the student to give to each instructor. This letter indicates which accommodations the student has qualified for and are intended to begin communication between the student and the instructor.</p> 
            <p><strong>To activate a <em>LOA</em> the student will need to:</strong></p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Meet personally with each of their instructors and provide their <em>LOA</em>.</li> 
             <li>Discuss and work with each instructor to determine the best method of providing accommodation(s) in specific situations/classes.</li> 
             <li>Organize with instructor and if applicable, DSS, scheduled accommodations such as testing or field trips <em><strong>prior to when each occurs </strong><strong><em>th</em>roughout</strong> </em>the quarter.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>During the Intake Interview, students will sign a <strong><em><a href="Documents/student-affairs/Disability Support Services/student-responsibilities.pdf" title="Student Responsibility Form" target="_blank">Student Responsibility Form</a></em></strong>, which outlines their basic responsibilities regarding accommodations implementation.</p> 
            <p>Students are responsible for self-advocating and for contacting DSS in a timely manner when problems or questions arise about their accommodations or academic progress.</p>

           <h4>What is a <strong>"reasonable accommodation"?</strong></h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Under the <em><a href="http://www.ada.gov/" title="Link to American with Disabilities Act website" target="_blank">Americans with Disability Act</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm" title="Link to information about Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act " target="_blank">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act</a></em>, a reasonable accommodation will be implemented as long as it is medically necessary (there is competent medical evidence establishing a relationship between the disability and the need for accommodation) and the accommodation does not impose an undue financial hardship or burden; does not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others; and does not make a substantial change in an essential element of the curriculum or a substantial alteration in the manner in which the service is provided.</p> 
            <p>The goal of reasonable accommodation is to give students with a disability the opportunity to demonstrate abilities and equal access to the learning environment. Individualized accommodations are not designed to give the student an advantage over other students, to alter a fundamental aspect of the course, or weaken academic integrity.</p> 
            <p>Accommodations for students are tailored on a case by case basis to the individual and the documented disability.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Are there unreasonable accommodations?</h4> 
           <div>
            "Undue Hardship"...
            <br>
            <br>There are three kinds of accommodations that are not considered reasonable:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol> 
             <li>If making the accommodation or allowing participation poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.</li> 
             <li>If making the accommodation means making a substantial change in an essential element of the curriculum or a substantial alteration in the manner in which you provide your services.</li> 
             <li>If it poses an undue financial or administrative burden.</li> 
            </ol>
           </div> 
           <h4>What is the procedure for Implementing Test Taking Accommodations?</h4> 
           <div>
            <ol> 
             <li>Student activates <em>Letter of Accommodation</em> (<em>LOA</em>) by providing a copy and discussing accommodations with the instructor.</li> 
             <li>3 to 4 days before the exam the student requests testing accommodations with the instructor (e.g. alternative test site, scribe, reader, large print, braille, etc.).</li> 
             <li>3 to 4 days before the exam the student organizes testing accommodations with Disability Support Services (DSS) (e.g. alternative test site, scribe, reader, large print, braille, etc.).</li> 
             <li>If the student is using an alternative test site the student confirms with the instructor the date and time they are scheduled to take the exam.</li> 
             <li>Instructor completes a <strong><em><a href="Documents/student-services/Disability Support Services/special-exam-instruction-form.pdf" title="Link to Special Exam Instruction Form PDF" target="_blank">Special Exam Instruction Form</a></em></strong> for the Testing Center and includes it with exam if the student is using an alternative test site.</li> 
             <li>Instructor arranges the delivery and retrieving of the exam from the Testing Center.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If the student does not show up at the appointed time, he/she will need to work with the instructor to reschedule the exam with the instructor. Or if the test is not at the Testing Center, the student contacts the instructor and DSS to reschedule the test date.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>When Large Print Version is needed:</strong></em></p> 
            <p>When a student requests large print, the instructor should contact the DSS Office to arrange delivery of the standard print exam for enlarging. It takes the DSS Office a day or two to complete the enlargement, but a lead-time of one week is most helpful. In many cases, the most effective solution involves the DSS Office providing the instructor with a small amount of instruction on producing large print via a standard copy machine or laser printer. In this case, the student should inform the instructor about the specifics of an effective enlargement.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>When Braille is needed: </strong></em></p> 
            <p>If a student needs Braille for a test, the faculty member should contact the DSS Office to work together to arrange its production. At least four weeks advance notice will be required for Brailing (more may be required for technical material). If the test or quiz is available on computer disk, the process of "Brailing" the test may take less time (two to three weeks lead time is usually sufficient with a week being preferred). However, if the test is only available in paper form, the production time can be up to five weeks. The key factor when planning for Braille testing is the lead-time. In addition and in most cases, Braille testing also involves a need for the student to schedule a scribe for recording answers.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>Use of Large Print and Braille may also require extended time for exam completion. </strong></em></p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>What is the Special Exam Instruction Form?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Instructors complete a <em><a href="Documents/student-services/Disability Support Services/special-exam-instruction-form.pdf" title="Link to Special Exam Instruction Form PDF" target="_blank">Special Exam Instruction Form</a></em> when a student with accommodations is taking the exam in the Testing Center. This form indicates which testing accommodation(s) the Testing Center should implement for the student.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>What is the deadline for students to ask for accommodations?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>There is no deadline for students to contact Disability Support Services (DSS). Although students are encouraged to contact DSS prior to any quarter, they may register with DSS or request their <em>LOA</em> any time throughout the quarter.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>What is Green River Non-Discrimination Policy?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">"Green River Community College is committed to the principle of equal opportunity in education and employment. The college does not discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, sex (including sexual harassment), sexual orientation, age, marital status, religion, disability, genetic information or on any other unlawful basis. The college is committed to preventing and stopping discrimination, including harassment, on any of these unlawful bases, and any associated retaliatory behavior. All employees and students must be allowed to work and learn in an environment free from discrimination. The College will comply with applicable laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, educational programs, and admissions, including Titles VII and IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the state law against discrimination, chapter 49.60 RCW." Human Resources -- Nondiscrimination Policies &amp; Discrimination Complaint Procedures, HR-22</span></p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Is it the Instructor or the college's responsibility to accommodate the student's disability?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Instructors, Disability Support Services (DSS), Counseling Services, IT, Enrollment Services, Financial Aid, etc., are "the college" and work in partnership with authorized accommodations. Disability law is clear that colleges must provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. DSS is responsible for identifying what accommodations are necessary so students with disabilities are not unfairly restricted, limited or discriminated by the impact of the disability.</p> 
            <p>Some accommodations will be provided by instructors i.e. providing large print, making notes available, allowing use of recorders, preferential seating, and flexibility in attendance, etc. Other accommodations will be coordinated by DSS i.e. brailing, captioning, matching up interpreters, providing written material in alternative format, quiet rooms for test, etc.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Why are there different types of accommodations?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Accommodations are tailored to the student's documented disability on a case by case basis. The impact of a disability is different for each individual.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Should an instructor include a statement for students with disabilities on their syllabus?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>DSS, along with the Instructional Council recommends that each course syllabus contain a statement reflecting compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, Section 504. Please use the following statement:</p> 
            <p><em>If you believe you qualify for course adaptations or special accommodations under the Americans With Disabilities Act, it is your responsibility to contact the Disability Support Services Coordinator in the LSC and provide the appropriate documentation. If you have already documented a disability or other condition through the Green River's Disability Support Services Office, which would qualify you for special accommodations, or if you have emergency medical information or special needs I should know about, please notify me during the first week of class. You can reach me by phone at 253-833-9111, extension ______. Or, you can schedule an office appointment to meet me in the ____ Office Building, office number ____ during my posted office hours or at another mutually determined time. If this location is not convenient for you, we will schedule an alternative place for the meeting. If you use an alternative medium for communicating, let me know well in advance of the meeting (at least one week) so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged.</em></p> 
            <p>It would be helpful if you draw attention to the DSS statement on the day you introduce the syllabus. Please do not have students discuss their specific needs within the hearing of other students. Please arrange to meet with the student outside of class time.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Does DSS give presentations?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Please contact DSS if you would like DSS to present at a faculty and/or division meeting. Below is the packet of information handed out at DSS' faculty/staff presentations.</p>

           <div> 
            <p>When initiating the appeal process, it is presumed that the student will have made a good faith effort and worked with the individual faculty or staff, division chair, dean's offices, and/or committees involved to try and resolve accommodation concerns. During these efforts, students may request the assistance of the DSS Director to help navigate the process. After exhausting all attempts to resolve issues through different pathways, and if the student believes that his/her accommodation concerns are still not being met, then the student may utilize the following appeal process:</p> 
            <p>If a student believes that the DSS Director has not provided reasonable, appropriate accommodations, or if the student believes that some individual, office, or committee of the institution has failed to appropriately accommodate his/her needs, or has in some way discriminated on the basis of disability, then the student has a right to appeal.</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>The student shall submit a written appeal to the Vice President of Student Services outlining the factual basis and rationale of the appeal.</li> 
             <li>Within thirty (30) instructional days or as soon thereafter as practicable, the Vice President of Student Services will review the appeal and make recommendations in writing for appropriate resolution.</li> 
             <li>If a satisfactory resolution is not reached, the student may present his/her appeal to the ADA Compliance Officer (Vice President of Human Resources).</li> 
             <li>The ADA Compliance Officer shall respond in writing within thirty (30) instructional days of the receipt of the appeal. The decision of the ADA Compliance Officer is the final decision of the institution.</li>

            <p>If a student has a grievance and would like to go outside the College for resolution, s/he may wish to contact:</p>

           <h3>Arranging for Green River's Entrance Test Accommodation</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Prospective or admitted students requesting accommodations for the placement test (either COMPASS or ASSET) must provide Disability Support Services (DSS) with documentation that supports the need for accommodation (e.g. reader, scribe, use of calculator, etc). Such documentation needs to be provided to the DSS Director in advance of the placement testing date. Five (5) working days are recommended to allow for assessment and coordination of services.</p> 
            <p>After documentation has been provided, and appropriate time allowed for assessment and coordination, contact DSS to schedule an appointment to take the placement test with accommodations.</p> 
            <p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> The COMPASS assessment helps place you in the proper reading, writing, and math course. It is not a pass or fail test.</p>
