          <p>The student receiving the highest All-USA Community College Academic Team application score in each state is named a Coca-Cola New Century Scholar and represents his/her state at the annual Presidents Breakfast at the American Association of Community Colleges Convention.</p> 
          <p> In addition, top scoring Phi Theta Kappa members from Canada, Washington, D.C., and from sovereign nations and U.S. territories where Phi Theta Kappa has chapters are named Coca-Cola New Century Scholars.</p> 
          <p>The program annually recognizes 52 Scholars with scholarships of $2,000 each, totaling $104,000 in awards. Each Scholarâ€™s nominating institution also receives special recognition at the American Association of Community Colleges Convention.</p> 
          <p>To be eligible for this program, students must submit an application for the All-USA Community College Academic Team and be selected as a nominee by their college. The application process opens in October and applications are due in early December each year.</p> 
          <p>An independent team of judges reviews the applications to determine scholarship recipients. Phi Theta Kappa notifies students selected as team members in March each year.</p> 
          <p>The Coca-Cola New Century Scholars program is sponsored by The Coca-Cola Foundation, The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation, the American Association of Community Colleges and Phi Theta Kappa.</p>
