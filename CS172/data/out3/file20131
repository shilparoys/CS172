      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-02-25T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Wednesday, February 25, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, MS &amp;ndash; Phi Theta Kappa Foundation Trustee Ray Hites, who helped establish the Hites Transfer Scholarship for Phi Theta Kappa members, died in Savannah, Georgia, on February 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/hites_raymond12%20%282%29.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/hites_raymond12%20%282%29.jpg?itok=p_5S8SI4" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray Hites&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ray will be missed tremendously. He loved serving as a trustee, never missed a meeting, and cherished the opportunity to meet the Hites Scholars at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Foundation CEO Dr. Nancy Rieves. &amp;ldquo;The students loved visiting with him and would gather at the front of the room after a general session to say thank you to him and his wife, Jackie, for making Hites Scholarships possible for Phi Theta Kappa members.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year 10 members are selected as Hites Scholars and receive scholarships of $7,500 each. Providing a total of $75,000 in scholarships annually, the Hites Scholarship program is Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007 the Hites Family Community College Scholarship Foundation challenged the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation to raise $350,000, which would be matched almost 2-1 by the Hites Foundation to create a $1 million scholarship endowment. The Foundation announced in 2009 that the challenge had been met and exceeded. The Hites Foundation then issued another equally successful challenge to create an endowment of over $2 million to provide transfer scholarships for Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hites Foundation was established by the brother of Ray Hites, the late Robert Hites, an executive with Ralston-Purina in St. Louis, Missouri. Upon his retirement, he fulfilled a lifelong dream and became an instructor at St. Louis Community College, where he valued the educational experience offered by community colleges and witnessed the determination and will to succeed of his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;As paperwork became more cumbersome, Hites Foundation Chair Ray Hites and the other board members were seeking a partner to take on the scholarship selection and distribution process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;Hites had said that it was amazing how the Hites Foundation and Phi Theta Kappa found each other and called the relationship &amp;ldquo;a perfect match.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;Fellow Foundation Trustees praised Hites as a remarkable individual who made an incredible impact on the lives of Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ray was an inspiration to Rosemary and me. The Hites Scholarship was our model for the Oberndorf Completion Scholarship effort,&amp;rdquo; said fellow Foundation Trustee Lou Oberndorf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;Dr. Rod Risley, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director and CEO, said, &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa has lost a dear friend, consummate gentleman, and legacy builder in Ray Hites. He leaves with us a legacy of leadership and philanthropy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;Services for Ray Hites were held on Monday, February 23. The Hites family has requested memorial gifts be made to the Hites Scholarship Fund through the &lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;Condolences may be sent to Mrs. Jackie Hites in care of the Phi Theta Kappa Scholarships Department at 1625 Eastover Drive, Jackson, MS&amp;nbsp; 39211. All notes sent by March 6 will be forwarded to Mrs. Hites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="margin-left:2.25pt;"&gt;To meet the 2014 Hites Scholars visit the &lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/news/phi-theta-kappa-awards-hites-scholars-75000-scholarships-1"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, or watch this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-tJL5ZgkjM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.

It is dependent upon the generosity of individuals, organizations, foundations and corporations to ensure its future through the support of existing and the establishment of new endowment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. More than 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 134,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Resurreccion Public Safety Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; Endowment provides scholarships exclusively to Phi Theta Kappa members who demonstrate potential for excellence in the public safety field while enrolled in a regionally accredited associate degree public safety program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IPSLEI Scholar Frederick Kerrigan, who has a 3rd degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do, volunteers at a martial arts studio in his community teaching children and adults self-defense skills. Kerrigan, who has earned a 4.0 grade point average at York Community College, hopes to attend law school, open his own law practice and someday become a judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellow IPSLEI scholarship recipient Rebecca Taylor has earned a 3.77 grade point average at Minnesota State College and hopes to earn advanced degrees in drug and alcohol counseling. A Native American, Taylor volunteers with at-risk youth and with the Department of Corrections as a cultural liaison and drug and alcohol counselor to prison inmates. She also leads a Native American youth drum and dance group in addition to serving as president of the Student Senate, Co-President of her Phi Theta Kappa chapter, and Vice Chairman of the American Indian Parents Advisory Committee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2012 IPSLEI partnered with Phi Theta Kappa to establish a scholarship endowment to be named in honor of Dr. Richard L. Resurreccion, Professor Emeritus of the College of Health and Human Services at California State University, Long Beach. A member of the IPSLEI Board of Directors, Dr. Resurreccion has 47 years of teaching experience in the first responder field at the secondary, two-year college, military and university levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the Richard L. Resurreccion Public Safety Scholarship, contact Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Scholarship Operations Department by &lt;a href="mailto:scholarships@ptk.org"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, at 601.987.5741, or visit the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;scholarships website&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on how your can contribute to the scholarship endowment, visit the &lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPSLEI was developed to bring the concepts of leadership and ethics to the forefront of an individual&amp;#39;s career, rather than waiting until a person is promoted into a supervisory position. This program is based on the belief one need not be a supervisor or manager to understand leadership principles and contribute to the leadership process. A cornerstone of the program is that effective leadership skills and influences are needed at all levels of the organization. This program utilizes the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society Leadership Development Program as a foundational component to the learning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

     <title>Reaching High School Students as Potential Members</title>

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-02-10T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, February 10, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a Saturday last November, a crowd of nearly 300 gathered at Trinity Valley Community College in Texas to participate in Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Program while learning more about the Society as a whole. It was part of the Iota Alpha Chapter&amp;rsquo;s Leaders of Tomorrow Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Got%20It.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Got%20It.jpg?itok=RLN6xVTX" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;High school seniors participate in Iota Alpha&amp;#39;s Leaders of Tomorrow Conference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference, now in its 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year, invites the 29 high schools in Trinity Valley&amp;rsquo;s college service area to choose their top three senior class leaders for the honor. School leaders, families, friends and mentors typically attend as well, exposing a great number of people to Phi Theta Kappa and its benefits and opportunities as well as to the college itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Several of our college administrators and several high school administrators have indicated that this is one of the best things that our chapter does for our college and for the high schools,&amp;rdquo; advisor Nancy Long said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently only about one in 10 students accepts membership into Phi Theta Kappa. The 2014-2015 International Officer Team is working to &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/awareness"&gt;increase the acceptance rate&lt;/a&gt; to 15 percent by the end of 2015, and reaching out to prospective members early on is a great way to increase visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;High school students need to enter community college knowing what Phi Theta Kappa is and aspiring to be a part of it,&amp;rdquo; International President Ebonee Carpenter said. &amp;ldquo;I love the example being set by the Iota Alpha Chapter and hope it will inspire others to look beyond the potential members on their campus and reach out to the potential members in their community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Gerlinger began taking dual enrollment courses at Hinds Community College in Mississippi as a student at Pisgah High School. Her early exposure to the college led her to attend a recruiting event there in early 2013, and she began taking Honors classes as a freshman in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring 2014 found her completing a leadership class and working as a chapter officer intern. In fall 2014, she was inducted as a member of the Gamma Lambda Chapter and was elected Vice President of Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need to reach out and inform as many students as possible so they can join Phi Theta Kappa and be rewarded with the scholarships they deserve and be involved in everything Phi Theta Kappa has to offer,&amp;rdquo; Gerlinger said. &amp;ldquo;High school students aren&amp;rsquo;t going to find these opportunities on their own. They still expect their parents, teachers and counselors to do it for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerlinger&amp;rsquo;s advisor, Debbie McCollum, said her chapter is working with the college&amp;rsquo;s Director of Dual Enrollment and Special Projects to inform dually enrolled students about Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hinds has the largest dual enrollment cohort in the state &amp;mdash; 1,283 in 2015,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;We believe that Phi Theta Kappa could encourage many of these students to enroll first in the community college instead of heading straight to a four-year college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;High school students who are dually enrolled in college are high-achieving students with a college degree as their goal. Phi Theta Kappa could be the vehicle that could steer them toward the community college and help them reach that goal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leaders of Tomorrow Conference began as a way for the Iota Alpha Chapter to promote &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/leadership-development"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development course.&lt;/a&gt; Many of the top local high school students were taking dual enrollment courses, and Long hoped giving them a preview of the leadership course would inspire them to sign up for the full course and encourage their peers to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We first used topics chosen from the Leadership Development text as material for speakers and for discussion groups at Leaders of Tomorrow, and we then &amp;mdash; and still do now &amp;mdash; used fun activities from the Leadership Development Course too,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference typically begins with an introduction to Phi Theta Kappa and the showing of a promotional video. Transfer scholarships are also discussed, as is the Leadership Development Course and its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa.leadership"&gt;Facebook study group.&lt;/a&gt; All participants also complete Dr. Taylor Hartman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;People Code&amp;rdquo; survey, and the students then compete in a leadership egg drop activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least two Leaders of Tomorrow have gone on to become Iota Alpha chapter presidents, and three others have become chapter officers. One of the chapter presidents received a &lt;a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/undergraduate-transfer/"&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; and will soon complete his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s the result of a domino effect that began at the Leaders of Tomorrow Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is important for two-year colleges and their best asset, Phi Theta Kappa chapters, to reach out to high school students because the students need to know the many benefits of earning two-year college associate degrees and certificates,&amp;rdquo; Long said. &amp;ldquo;Emphasizing that Phi Theta Kappa can be a stepping stone to their bright futures may help strong students with leadership potential make choices that are better for them, and they will influence many other students and their attitudes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Phi Theta Kappa Members Boast 91 Percent Success Rate</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/student-success-data 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-02-08T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Sunday, February 8, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers don&amp;rsquo;t lie: a recent study of Phi Theta Kappa members shows that members have an overall student success rate of 91 percent, compared to a national success rate of just 38 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/National.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/National.jpg?itok=uLfnjFTs" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa members have a 91 percent student success rate, compared to 38 percent nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come as President Barack Obama puts a spotlight on community colleges in his proposal to offer free tuition to two-year college students. They also help align Phi Theta Kappa with the President&amp;rsquo;s call to increase the number of Americans with college degrees by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The data shows that Phi Theta Kappa is a valued partner in student completion,&amp;rdquo; Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Through research-based and diverse programming, we have proven that Phi Theta Kappa establishes a culture of completion among its members, which is vital in today&amp;rsquo;s society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is estimated that 65 percent of jobs will require some kind of postsecondary credential by 2018. Phi Theta Kappa is establishing itself as a powerful tool in helping community colleges meet the challenge issued to them in 2010 to produce an additional 5 million certificates and degrees by the end of the decade.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2014, Phi Theta Kappa conducted a 50-state survey of student success from a random sample of more than 14,000 members. The methodology used was similar to that used by community colleges to determine their completion and transfer-out rates for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Surveys (IPEDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students studied were inducted as Phi Theta Kappa members in 2009 and were pulled randomly from the Society&amp;rsquo;s membership database. Using matching datasets from the National Student Clearinghouse Student Tracker Database, it was determined that the completion rate for Phi Theta Kappa members was 83 percent and the transfer-out rate was 9 percent, giving the members an overall success rate of 91 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Honestly, I was stunned at the results,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Information and Research Officer Dr. Lynn Tincher-Ladner. &amp;ldquo;We knew Phi Theta Kappa was making a positive impact in the success rate of its members, but we had no idea the difference would be this remarkable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are Phi Theta Kappa members four times more likely to complete college than an average student, but also they are nearly twice as likely to complete college than students with similar grade point averages (3.5 or higher).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And it isn&amp;rsquo;t like Phi Theta Kappa members are that different from average community college students,&amp;rdquo; Tincher-Ladner said. &amp;ldquo;In fact, when we looked at the demographics, our members were strikingly similar to their non-member peers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;45 percent of members receive Pell grant assistance, and 38 percent of all community college students receive Pell;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;38 percent of members are first-generation college students, and 36 percent of all community college students are first generation;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;44 percent of members took at least one developmental course, and 60 percent of all community college students take at least one developmental course;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28 is the average age of a member, and it is also the average age of a community college student;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;66 percent of members are female, and 57 percent of all community college students are female;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;33 percent of members are minorities, and 48 percent of all community college students are minorities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All signs seem to point to student engagement in Phi Theta Kappa being the key to success,&amp;rdquo; Tincher-Ladner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa has been intentional in creating programs and initiatives that align with student success benchmarks outlined by the Center for Community College Student Engagement. These benchmarks &amp;mdash; active and collaborative learning, student effort, academic challenge, student-faculty interaction and support for learners &amp;mdash; have been proven to be powerful contributors to effective teaching, learning and student retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each community college president and each chapter&amp;rsquo;s contact advisor have received specific completion data for their state and engagement data for their chapter to review and use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This study proves that students desire, need and respond to external validation of their achievements,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;However, only 12 percent of students invited to membership in Phi Theta Kappa accept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Colleges can increase student completion rates dramatically by being much more intentional in recognizing students eligible for membership in the classroom and explaining how Phi Theta Kappa membership can increase their likelihood of completing college. Being a member of Phi Theta Kappa matters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>College’s Foundation Helps Cover Member Fees</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/foundation-pays-member-fees 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-02-04T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Wednesday, February 4, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 28.7 percent member acceptance rate for the Theta Iota Chapter at Snead State Community College in Alabama wasn&amp;rsquo;t good enough for college president Dr. Robert Exley &amp;mdash; as a member and former National Officer, he knows all too well the opportunities that students are passing up. Why weren&amp;rsquo;t more of his students saying, &amp;ldquo;Yes!&amp;rdquo; to Phi Theta Kappa? How could he get that number up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Exley%2C%20Robert.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Exley%2C%20Robert.jpg?itok=r_fa_vB6" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Exley, Snead State Community College President and Phi Theta Kappa alumnus and former National President&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found his answer at a meeting with the college&amp;rsquo;s Foundation Board. As he presented the acceptance rate, the board members unanimously pledged to help pay the membership fee and committed $4,000 per semester to help pay for 50 percent of the $80 registration fee for up to 100 students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I want to make sure our students know there&amp;rsquo;s a bigger world out there, so we work hard to get students in Phi Theta Kappa and to get them to Convention,&amp;rdquo; Exley said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa totally changed everything for me. I never looked back, and I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exley was content earning C&amp;rsquo;s in high school. After graduation, he worked five years in a petrochemical plant before deciding he wanted a safer job. He enrolled at San Jacinto College in Texas, although he said, &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I belonged there.&amp;rdquo; He befriended the janitor, and the two often had coffee together.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, a faculty member asked Exley if he planned become a Phi Theta Kappa member. They went together to talk to the chapter advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the first time in my life, I found I could learn things just to learn them, not for the sake of a grade in a class,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It was like somebody had turned on an intellectual curiosity in me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He attended Honors Institute, and his relationship with Phi Theta Kappa &amp;ldquo;went to another level.&amp;rdquo; In 1979, he was elected National President. He went on to receive his bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and master&amp;rsquo;s degrees from the University of Houston-Clear Lake and his doctorate from the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And I met my wife through Phi Theta Kappa as well, so there you go,&amp;rdquo; Exley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since joining Snead State Community College, Exley has watched the number of Phi Theta Kappa inductees grow regularly. He remembers only about eight new members at his first induction at the college; at his most recent induction, there were 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We applaud Dr. Exley&amp;rsquo;s effort to ensure that no student be denied membership because they cannot afford it,&amp;rdquo; Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley said. &amp;ldquo;The Phi Theta Kappa membership experience, programs and scholarships are life-altering. The providing of funds to help those students to accept membership is consistent with our colleges&amp;rsquo; mission of providing access to education with the support and resources necessary to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For students who are eligible to accept membership, their student success rate nearly doubles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student success has been a major focus on Snead State&amp;rsquo;s campus in recent years. The college recently increased its graduation rate to 32 percent in 2014 from 18 percent in 2008. A recent nationwide study by Phi Theta Kappa has found that Society members are four times more likely to graduate than their non-member peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exley hopes the move by the Foundation Board will encourage an even larger number of new Phi Theta Kappa members. He&amp;rsquo;s also looking at other ways to encourage students to accept their membership invitation, including possibly having faculty and staff members sponsor a student by paying half or all of their membership fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this opportunity, and I think we&amp;rsquo;re going to see a big spike in our membership numbers,&amp;rdquo; said chapter advisor Brittany Goble. &amp;ldquo;I think there&amp;rsquo;s definitely been a need, because $80 at the beginning of a semester is a lot of money for a student to have to come up with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before becoming chapter advisor in 2010, Goble worked at Snead State with the National Advisory Corps as a transfer advisor. Phi Theta Kappa membership was an organization she pushed students to work toward and take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her chapter officers are now working on a plan to promote the Foundation Board&amp;rsquo;s decision and to recognize the students in need. They hope to start implementing the aid this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;(The Foundation&amp;rsquo;s decision) shows a continuation of the administration&amp;rsquo;s support,&amp;rdquo; chapter advisor Brittany Goble said. &amp;ldquo;It really makes it possible for some who couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it otherwise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The 2015 &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/honors/institute"&gt;Honors Institute&lt;/a&gt; will be held at University of New Mexico in Albuquerque June 15-20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Advisor Leadership Development Scholarship will be awarded annually to the advisor with the strongest Faculty Scholar application who has not been previously certified in the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/leadership-development"&gt;Leadership Development Studies Program&lt;/a&gt; and who is not eligible for the Parnell Scholarship. The scholarship covers full tuition costs for an Instructor Certification Seminar during the present year or the next year &amp;ndash; a value of more than $1,600.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;During the Faculty Scholar Conference, held at the Center for Excellence January 29-31, first-time Faculty Scholar Cassandra Powell, a linguistics and English professor at Carl Sandburg College in Illinois, was announced as the first recipient of the scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The scholarship was presented by Mayfield and Monika Byrd, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Leadership Development and Service Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Mayfield knows the benefits of the Phi Theta Kappa Leadership Development Studies Program first-hand &amp;mdash; she became a certified instructor in 2002, and Kevin Windham, advisor to the Phi Theta Kappa chapter at Shelton State, is also a certified instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;A former Vice President at East Mississippi Community College, Mayfield earned a Ph.D. in educational leadership from Mississippi State University, where she was a colleague of Risley. As a longtime advocate of Phi Theta Kappa, Mayfield said she has watched the organization thrive and positively impact the lives of students thanks to Risley&amp;rsquo;s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Risley has dedicated his life to Phi Theta Kappa to make a difference in the lives of others. His servant leadership and his passion for supporting success in others should be recognized,&amp;rdquo; Mayfield said. &amp;ldquo;This scholarship in Dr. Risley&amp;#39;s honor will be used to develop leaders necessary to continue his vision of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Risley is unmatched in his commitment and support for developing the next generation of leaders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;During the Faculty Scholar Conference, Risley and Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Honors Programs, also presented Mitch Stimers with the Parnell Scholarship. Given in honor of former American Association of Community Colleges President and Phi Theta Kappa Board Member Dr. Dale Parnell, the scholarship covers registration expenses for a Faculty Scholar who has not previously attended NerdNation, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;A first-time Faculty Scholar, Stimers serves as a geography/geoscience professor at Cloud County Community College in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

     <title>Fundraising Best Practices: Going Beyond Bake Sales</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/fundraising-best-practices 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-02-02T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Monday, February 2, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities in the year of a typical Phi Theta Kappa chapter often include fundraisers to help support its goals. Whether the money raised will be used to start or contribute to a scholarship fund, cover expenses for regional or international travel, or simply offset operational costs, one thing remains the same: the fundraiser must be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/RainCityRockPOSTER.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/RainCityRockPOSTER.jpg?itok=ZHAa6AFZ" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promotional poster for the Rain City Rock concert hosted by the Alpha Chi Zeta Chapter at Seattle Central College&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many chapters know what fundraisers work well for their college and community. They know what their peers respond to; they know what will bring in the money they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/SmartyPants.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/SmartyPants.jpg?itok=TE0kKGJd" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Smarty Pants&amp;quot; sold by the Kansas Region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, a chapter goes beyond the bake sale, the 5K, the raffle. When the risk is big, the reward often is as well, as two chapters and one region have recently found. Heed their advice as you plan your yearly fundraisers, and be inspired by what they were able to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rain City Rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Chi Zeta Chapter at Seattle Central College in Washington does a yearly fundraiser to help fund scholarships through its school&amp;rsquo;s foundation. Several of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s officers and members in early 2014 had experience playing in, booking, and/or promoting a band. So, as they planned their fundraiser, a rock concert seemed a natural fit for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rain City Rock&amp;rdquo; was held on Memorial Day 2014 in the Nectar Lounge, a local hangout off campus, which donated the space. Five local bands were booked &amp;mdash; each of which donated their time &amp;mdash; and the concert was open to all ages. Tickets were $8 pre-sale and $10 at the door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the chapter raised more than $3,000, said chapter advisor Nada Oakley. Combined with previous, smaller-scale fundraisers and a matching gift from the school&amp;rsquo;s foundation, more than $6,000 was donated to the scholarship fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Advertising in the community, ticket sales in the community, planning the event in the community, I think that made all the difference,&amp;rdquo; Oakley said. &amp;ldquo;We needed a large fundraiser to support our scholarships, and this brought a lot of visibility to Phi Theta Kappa and to our chapter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smarty Pants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves good, nerdy gear, as the Kansas Region has found through the sale of its Smarty Pants. Kansas Region Alumni Association President Lucus Drake designed these pants in 2012 when he was an officer in the Alpha Phi Alpha Chapter. They were sold on campus at Butler Community College but were discontinued when he transferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, the Kansas Regional Officers needed to raise money for scholarships and programming. They reached out to Drake, who approved their selling. The proceeds are split between the Kansas Region and its Alumni Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas Regional Coordinator Tammy Fuentez said when the first shipment of pants came in, she posted a picture of them on Facebook. A Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters staffer saw and shared the picture on the alumni Facebook page, and &amp;ldquo;the started selling like crazy,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We shipped from Washington to Florida to Massachusetts, including 15 pairs to a chapter in South Carolina,&amp;rdquo; Fuentez said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a great way to help us support Phi Theta Kappa awareness as well as raise money to continue to provide scholarships for our regional members.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important note: the design is copyrighted and cannot be used by another group.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Contact &lt;a href="http://TammyF@labette.edu"&gt;Tammy Fuentez&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The $27,000 Honors in Action Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 the Chi Nu Chapter at Eastern Florida State College&amp;rsquo;s Melbourne Campus chose to work with Air Mobile Ministries, a local charity that provides water filtration systems to disaster areas and areas where clean drinking water is in short supply. It was their Honors in Action Project, and the chapter raised more than $27,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter held a fundraising gala at the home of the couple who own Air Mobile Ministries &amp;mdash; a home that had recently been featured on the show &amp;ldquo;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.&amp;rdquo; This added to the appeal of the event and drew many from the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There were probably over a hundred people that actually showed up, and there was a donation box set up in the main house,&amp;rdquo; said chapter advisor Maureen Groome. &amp;ldquo;(The homeowners) had also procured some items for a silent auction that helped to contribute to the total amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I found out the total amount, I was stunned.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sponsors covered the cost of food and flower arrangements. The home was decorated with artifacts from the homeowners&amp;rsquo; travels with their organization. The college and local churches donated tables and chairs, and a local tent company donated tents for outdoor seating and entertaining. A jazz band from a local high school provided entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He is the first in his family to be born in the United States and had never had the opportunity to travel overseas and visit the homeland of his ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Unknown-2.jpeg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Unknown-2.jpeg?itok=15r5y_Ht" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Member Allan Lao and his ISLP delegation pose with students in China&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brochure received in part because of his Phi Theta Kappa membership changed that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/islp"&gt;International Scholar Laureate Program (ISLP)&lt;/a&gt; allows community college students to study one of five career fields in five countries: Australia, China, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States (San Francisco). Programs are major-specific and hold opportunities in Business and Entrepreneurship, Engineering and Technology, International Relations and Diplomacy, Medicine and Science, and Nursing and Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Unknown-7.jpeg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Unknown-7.jpeg?itok=IfFfc2p1" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alumna Jessica Troxel takes a selfie in Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It gave me an excuse to get out of my comfort zone,&amp;rdquo; Lao said. &amp;ldquo;It gave me a new type of excitement, I guess. I also saw it as an opportunity to advance my knowledge of engineering and culture in China.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa has partnered with ISLP to offer $10,000 in scholarships for its members to participate. The deadline to apply for a position in the summer 2015 ISLP delegation is February 13; the deadline to &lt;a href="http://www.scholarlaureate.org/scholarships.html"&gt;apply for a scholarship&lt;/a&gt; is February 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lao, a member of the Alpha Sigma Delta Chapter at Merced College in California, received an $800 scholarship to help fund his trip to China during the summer of 2014. He is an aerospace/mechanical engineering major and was able to tour companies such as Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney Shanghai Engine Center, a Volkswagen assembly plant and one of China&amp;rsquo;s major software design companies with a group of about 30 other engineering students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was nice being with people who had similar interests and education as myself,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s also nice to talk to people who really know what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;None of us really spoke any bit of Chinese, and my knowledge of the language didn&amp;rsquo;t really help much either, but the fact that we had each other made it more interesting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rina Annisa, former president of the Alpha Theta Eta Chapter at Olney Central College in Illinois, also traveled to China through ISLP in the summer of 2014. She is no stranger to foreign travel &amp;mdash; originally from Indonesia, she spent her senior year as a high school exchange student in North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annisa had previously traveled to Chongqing, China, in 2009 as a participant of a different study abroad program and was eager to return. While she initially applied to the Business and Entrepreneurship forum in Australia and New Zealand, she eagerly accepted a scholarship to attend the International Relations and Diplomacy forum in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was actively seeking a program that would give me a chance to experience foreign cultures and a career interest at the same time,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;ISLP offered outstanding programs with a great combination of professional development and engagement activities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her trip, Annisa and her group were able to visit the home of a local in Xi&amp;rsquo;an. It instantly reminded her of the culture in her home country and served as a stark reminder of the differences in Eastern and Western culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having a first-hand experience to understand a culture &amp;mdash; whether from a formal discussion or eating a traditional grilled squid on the street &amp;mdash; will always be a memorable learning experience,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISLP took &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/news/scholars-find-second-chances"&gt;Jessica Troxel,&lt;/a&gt; a recent Phi Theta Kappa alumna and Indiana&amp;rsquo;s 2014 New Century Scholar, to Australia and New Zealand over the summer of 2014 with the Business and Entrepreneurship delegation. While she could have traveled to China or San Francisco, she admits the Australian and New Zealand accents swayed her decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was yet another opportunity directly related to my hard work,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I knew it was a long shot raising the amount of money required. I believed in my ability and myself; I knew I could count on my family, friends, campus and community to back me up on this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I also knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and was thrilled!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel is a single mother to two boys. She also lost her left arm in a car accident in 2008. Despite the challenges she has faced, she proved herself to be a leader at Ivy Tech Community College-Bloomington and is today a social work major at Indiana University. Her travels abroad &amp;mdash; including a trip to Guatemala in early 2014 &amp;mdash; have awakened in her an interest in Cultural and Social Anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This experience did change me in ways that are almost difficult to explain,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It was a lot of personal growth and deep personal reflection in relation to my circumstances as a &amp;lsquo;disabled&amp;rsquo; person that is a woman full of ability. No amount of money or words can define the tremendous value on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My travel experience has opened my eyes to a much larger world with so many more possibilities. I realized that after I earn my degree, I could work in another country or study in another country of do anything I want to do.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Phi Theta Kappa Joins AACC in Letter to Congress</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/letter-to-congress 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-01-22T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Thursday, January 22, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a letter written to members of the United State Congress by the American Association of Community Colleges and signed by community college leaders, including Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the Honorable Members of the 114&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Congress:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama reminded us in his State of the Union address, &amp;ldquo;America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.&amp;rdquo; He has unveiled a plan for free community college education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these words the President presented Congress with an unprecedented opportunity to solve many of our nation&amp;rsquo;s greatest challenges &amp;ndash; a lack of affordable higher education, stagnant wages, stubborn pockets of poverty and fierce global economic competition. Without his leadership, we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have arrived at this pivotal moment for educational opportunity. But the keys to unlock the future potential growth of America are now firmly in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We write as leaders of the nation&amp;rsquo;s community college campuses, trustees, policy advisors and advocates. We all stand ready to work with one another and with Congress to make this promise a reality. As we have in the past with collaborations that strengthen our institutions such as Democracy&amp;#39;s Colleges: &amp;nbsp;A Call to Action to Address the Completion Agenda, we can assist our nation&amp;rsquo;s lawmakers in seizing this moment to ensure America&amp;rsquo;s College Promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s remember that the nearly 14 million community college students are your constituents. They are Red, Blue and Independents. They are old and young. They are black and white, Latino, Asian &amp;ndash; the very mosaic of our society. Our students are diverse, but they are all striving to obtain skills for good jobs, to launch a four-year degree, and to achieve economic security for themselves and their families. But their demand is outpacing what we can supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mission-driven not-for-profits, we offer by far the best value in higher education, and we have fought against the odds to keep our tuition and fees low. Our average annual cost to students is $3,264, compared to $8,893 for a public four-year college and $30,090 for a private four-year college. But students still have to pay rent, use transportation, buy books, feed themselves and for many, their children. Our students often come from families and communities on the losing side of the country&amp;rsquo;s expanding economic inequality. Millions are priced out of college, or taking on debt that will drag them down for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With open doors to all we are 1,200 colleges strong, in cities, suburbs and rural areas nationwide. As members of local communities in every state in the nation, community colleges know about collaboration. Our leaders have worked successfully for decades with both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as many for-profit institutions. We will need to find additional support to expand our underfunded system. However, educational and economic opportunity is our mission and we can meet the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By funding community college education, Congress can make one of the most profitable investments in the national economy. The business community is clamoring for a better educated workforce. It is estimated that as many as 3 million job openings in the US go unfilled for months on end, as roughly half of employers now say they are having a hard time finding qualified workers to hire, particularly in technical fields. Community colleges provide students with the necessary training to fill that gap. A recent study found that on an individual level, every $1 a student invests in his or her community college education yields, on average, a return on investment (ROI) of $3.80. But for taxpayers, the ROI per dollar is even better: $6.80 over the course of students&amp;rsquo; working lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider then that with the unsustainable escalation of tuition, our nation has amassed $1 trillion in student loan debt &amp;ndash; and many end up defaulting. Every dollar we invest now is one we don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay later &amp;ndash; particularly when Americans are without the skills they need, unemployed, or working for such low wages that they are forced to depend on social services. Community college graduates earn 20 percent more than their peers with high school diplomas. We applaud the President&amp;rsquo;s suggestion for sharing the burden &amp;ndash; students do their part through maintaining solid grades, and the State and Federal government use the people&amp;rsquo;s money to create more graduates, well-paid workers and contributing taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 78&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; US Congress passed the GI Bill, creating the catalyst for the greatest economic expansion in our nation&amp;rsquo;s history and constructing a middle class that the world would envy. As members of the 114th Congress, you too can go down in history having opened the doors of opportunity to the American people. Members, we ask you respectfully, don&amp;rsquo;t squander this moment. Fulfill America&amp;rsquo;s College Promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walter G. Bumphus, President and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges.&lt;br /&gt;J. Noah Brown, President and CEO, Association of Community College Trustees&lt;br /&gt;Gerardo de los Santos, President and CEO, The League for Innovation in the Community College&lt;br /&gt;Evelyn Waiwaiole, Director, Center for Community College Student Engagement&lt;br /&gt;Rod Risley, Executive Director and CEO, Phi Theta Kappa, International&lt;br /&gt;William Trueheart, President and CEO, Achieving the Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Final Five Star Chapter Plan Reminders</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/final-five-star-reminders 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2015-01-21T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Wednesday, January 21, 2015&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a thousand Phi Theta Kappa chapters have been working to achieve Two to Five Stars in the Five Star Chapter Plan over the past year. To receive your hard-earned recognition, we encourage you to report your progress by &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, January 28.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Star Chapter Plan is a roadmap for creating strong chapters, which in turn creates strong members and a robust college campus. The plan puts the mission of Phi Theta Kappa into action through five levels of engagement that progress from local, campus involvement to regional and international involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the important roles Phi Theta Kappa plays is cultivating leadership,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Cindy Miles, Chancellor of the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District in California. &amp;ldquo;To meet our college completion and transfer goals, we need students as strong, engaged partners.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Phi Theta Kappa chapters began 2014 at the One Star Level. Beyond that, chapters are encouraged to participate at the level that fits them best each year. Participation at every level of the Five Star Plan is critical to fulfilling the mission of Phi Theta Kappa, said Jennifer Stanford, the Society&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 28 is a big day at Phi Theta Kappa &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s also the deadline to submit Hallmark Awards applications for Honors in Action and College Project awards. So don&amp;rsquo;t let the Five Star reporting deadline get lost in the shuffle. Here are some key points to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not wait until the deadline to report your chapter&amp;rsquo;s progress. &lt;/strong&gt;Both advisors and chapter officers may report progress in the Five Star Chapter Plan as activities are completed throughout the year at &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;ptk.org/fivestar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hallmark Awards participation will be updated in early February, following the January 28 deadline for submitting applications. &lt;/strong&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters Staff will automatically update the activity for chapters submitting entries after the Hallmark Awards deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters will be recognized for their 2014 Five Star achievements in the spring of 2015. &lt;/strong&gt;Chapters are recognized for the highest level for which they completed AND reported all the requirements in addition to completing and reporting all of the requirements of the levels below that highest level. In other words, a Three Star Chapter would have completed all activities in Levels One, Two and Three. There are three levels of recognition:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Local: An email will be sent to your college president citing the significance of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s achievement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regional: The chapter will receive the award certificate during your region&amp;rsquo;s annual awards presentation in the spring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International: The achievement will be listed on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s website and at the 2015 Annual Convention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information for the 2015 Five Star Chapter Plan will be posted on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s website in February.&lt;/strong&gt; A breakdown of the plan can be found in the Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success, which all advisors will be receiving soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guide includes a suggested timeline aimed at helping you complete your goal. New advisors and chapter presidents will also receive this helpful tool as they are reported to Headquarters throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every chapter begins anew every calendar year, allowing chapters to have a fresh start and a challenging goal year after year,&amp;rdquo; Stanford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-12-18T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Thursday, December 18, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, MS &amp;mdash; Ebonee Carpenter, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s 2014-2015 International President and a student at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida, has been elected to serve on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/about/board-of-directors"&gt;Board of Directors,&lt;/a&gt; Chairman Kip Johnson has announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/carpenter_ebonee.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/carpenter_ebonee.jpg?itok=Y8NyiqkY" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014-2015 International President Ebonee Carpenter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter will serve as the Student Representative to the Board of Directors through April of 2015. She will meet with the Board during the Annual Winter Meeting, to be held January 24 in Washington, D.C., and again in April 2015 during NerdNation, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention, to be held in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter was elected International President during the Society&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention in Orlando, Florida, in 2014. She has represented the Society during official events throughout the 2014-2015 academic year and will preside with her fellow officers over NerdNation 2015. She will deliver the keynote address during the second general session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter is a Paralegal Studies major who had previously planned to attend law school. However, she has recently been inspired by her Phi Theta Kappa experience to consider pursuing degrees in sociology and organizational leadership. She is a past president of the Alpha Lambda Alpha Chapter at Hillsborough Community College and is currently serving as executive vice president. She is also a former member of the Florida Regional Executive Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Biloxi, Mississippi, to parents in the United States Air Force, Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s family moved around a lot before finally settling in Warner Robins, Georgia. She is a non-traditional student and mother to a 12-year-old son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her many responsibilities, Carpenter has a variety of interests and hobbies. One of her favorite hobbies is singing &amp;mdash; she began when she was just 3 years old. She enjoys watching television crime dramas, and she is interested in electronics. She volunteers with Keep Tampa Beautiful and as a guest teacher with Junior Achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director Dr. Rod A. Risley submitted Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s nomination to the Board based on recommendations of staff members working closely with the International Officers since last April.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She has earned the respect of staff, regional coordinators, and fellow officers in carrying out the responsibilities of her elected office,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;We feel certain that she will ably represent the membership during Board deliberations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Odu, Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s chapter advisor, speaks highly of her leadership abilities and of her ability to inspire others. Mia Ramos-Shirley, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development for Division III, works closely with the International Officer team and echoed his sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have had the distinct pleasure of working with Ebonee, witnessing her ability to lead effectively and inspire greatness in others,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Ebonee leads her fellow International Officers in such a way that allows each one to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She also serves as a role model to our many members of color. Several members have expressed their appreciation for having such a role model in a position of leadership.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, Canada, Germany, Peru, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

Why wait any longer? Go ahead and reserve your spot today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/2015_Convlogo_sombrero.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2015_Convlogo_sombrero.jpg?itok=FcK8Sa8J" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NerdNation promises to be an experience like none other. Nearly 4,000 Phi Theta Kappa members, advisors, supporters, partners and friends from nearly 500 chapters will gather April 16-18 at the &lt;a href="http://www.sahbgcc.com/default.asp?sanantonio=14&amp;amp;urlkeyword=Attendees"&gt;Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; in San Antonio, Texas, for engagement and networking unmatched elsewhere. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be legendary!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/speakers/general-session/john-legend"&gt;John Legend.&lt;/a&gt; The Grammy-winning musician will open the event in the first general session, sharing his creative process and performing three songs. His latest album, &lt;em&gt;Love in the Future, &lt;/em&gt;gave him his first number one hit with &amp;ldquo;All of Me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be an experience you do not want to miss. In addition to Legend, &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/speakers/michio-kaku"&gt;Dr. Michio Kaku&lt;/a&gt; will also take to the NerdNation stage as the featured speaker in the third general session.

     <title>Breaking Down the Hallmark Awards</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/breaking-down-hallmark-awards 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-12-04T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Thursday, December 4, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Hallmark Awards exist to recognize the hard work, growth and development of chapters over the course of the year as members engage in Society programs and initiatives. They also serve to recognize the support and dedication of advisors and college administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hallmark Awards entry is the one thing that will determine which projects, chapters, advisors, members, officers, administrators and teams will be recognized for their excellence on the international level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We understand how hard our chapters and members work during the year,&amp;rdquo; said Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs. &amp;ldquo;The projects they undertake as part of the Honors in Action program are amazing, and they deserve to be rewarded for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Hallmark Awards program allows us to do that, but we know how involved the submissions can be. We aim to make that as easy as possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa provides questions and rubrics as a guide to completing these entries, in addition to feedback from your previous year&amp;rsquo;s entries. These questions and rubrics are updated every year based on feedback from the Association of Chapter Advisors officers and Headquarters staff members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When nominating advisors for awards, for example, there are a few things chapter officers and members will want to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In what ways did the advisor support and encourage chapter development?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did they assist members in developing leadership, personal and professional skills?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did they encourage participation in Phi Theta Kappa programming, both within the chapter and on the regional or international levels?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s important to consider each of these things comprehensively,&amp;rdquo; Edwards said. &amp;ldquo;For instance, some rubrics and questions ask how an advisor contributed to the Honors in Action Project specifically. While not all advisors work directly with that project, work done in other areas &amp;mdash; chapter officer training, project planning, goal setting &amp;mdash; relates to Honors in Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, while there may not be a direct connection between an advisor&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities and the Hallmark Award category, looking at the work they do elsewhere with the chapter, such as officer training that has an impact on chapter members being able to complete their Honors in Action project, would qualify them for an award.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nominating an administrator is a bit more straightforward. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider all the ways these questions might apply to your nominee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has your administrator built a solid foundation for the chapter?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has your administrator developed scholarship opportunities?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has your administrator funded chapter operations and events?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has your administrator supported Phi Theta Kappa programs?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How has your administrator increased visibility of Phi Theta Kappa as a student success partner with the college?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rubrics for all awards are very comprehensive; your evaluation of your nominee should be similar.&amp;nbsp; Don&amp;rsquo;t take what they do at face value; rather, consider more indirect ways their work and support impact the chapter and its projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline to submit &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark/categories#administrator"&gt;Administrator Hallmark Award&lt;/a&gt; entries is 5 pm CST December 10. &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark/categories#member"&gt;Individual Hallmark Awards&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; including &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark/categories#advisor"&gt;Advisor Awards&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; are due January 14, 2015, and &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark/categories#chapter"&gt;Chapter Awards&lt;/a&gt; are due January 28, 2015.

     <title>Member Among 2014 Boren Scholars, Spending Year in Africa</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/member-among-boren-scholars 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-12-04T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Thursday, December 4, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wade Southwell, a Phi Theta Kappa member from Ozarks Technical Community College in Missouri, is spending nearly a year in Africa as a 2014 Boren Scholar. He is one of 160 college students &amp;mdash; and one of just two community college students &amp;mdash; to receive the scholarship award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Boren%20Convocation.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Boren%20Convocation.jpg?itok=grQ5ymen" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa member Wade Southwell at the Boren Convocation in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My main feeling from this, more than excitement, fear or bewilderment, is gratitude,&amp;rdquo; Southwell said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s very rare for this scholarship to be awarded to a student from a community college.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Wade%20in%20S%20Africa.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Wade%20in%20S%20Africa.jpg?itok=lzC46sNu" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wade Southwell in South Africa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.borenawards.org"&gt;Boren Scholarships&lt;/a&gt; are issued by the National Security Education Program and provide unique funding opportunities for United States undergraduate students to study less commonly taught languages in world regions critical to U.S. interests. These are also regions that are underrepresented in typical study abroad programs, including Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Eurasia, Latin America and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to $20,000 is provided for programs ranging from a summer to a full academic year. In exchange for funding, Boren Scholars commit to working in the federal government for at least one year after graduation. &lt;a href="https://www.borenawards.org/boren_scholarship/how_apply.html"&gt;Applications&lt;/a&gt; are now being accepted for 2015 and are due February 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwell is a 24-year-old non-traditional student. He dropped out of high school at 16 and received his GED. When he began college at 23, he earned membership in the Alpha Psi Tau Chapter, even receiving a scholarship to cover the cost of membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Becoming a member of Phi Theta Kappa was a huge confidence booster, and it allowed me to see myself in a different light,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Feeling connected was always a huge contributing factor to my success and satisfaction in college, and Phi Theta Kappa was a great way to make strong, positive connections.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwell has always been eager to study abroad. Because Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC) has no study abroad program, he reached out to the study abroad director at Missouri State University (MSU). He was basically given two options: be patient and wait until he transferred to a university, or apply for the Boren Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was told not to get my hopes up because MSU students have applied every year for this scholarship, and no one has ever gotten it,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The idea of a first-year community college student receiving the Boren International Scholarship was absurd; but the more I learned about the scholarship, the more I realized that it was a perfect fit for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwell left the United States on August 2 and arrived in South Africa two days later. He will spend the next 11 months studying isiZulu, an African language, at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. So far, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been without its adjustments. The travel to South Africa alone reminded him that each country requires a different power cord. Also, he had to acquire insurance that covers war, natural disaster and civil unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;rsquo;s the metric system. Upon his first trip to the gym, Southwell was concerned his strength was declining; it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until he remembered that weight is measured in kilograms rather than pounds that he realized he was trying to do a 60-pound bicep curl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in dozens of cities within the United States, and each certainly has its own culture; but living in another country is entirely different,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m taking everything with an open mind and constantly realizing that, growing up as an American and never leaving the U.S., my world view is incredibly limited. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping my year in South Africa opens me up to become a more cultured, intelligent and insightful person.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application process was rigorous and required hours and hours of research. Southwell wrote more than a dozen drafts of each essay before arriving at the ones he submitted. He attended every informational webinar that was offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wade is an amazing student who works hard and is not afraid to take on new challenges,&amp;rdquo; said Jo Fritts, advisor to the Alpha Psi Tau Chapter. &amp;ldquo;He has been a wonderful asset for our chapter by being willing to volunteer and assist with many of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m proud of his accomplishments within Phi Theta Kappa and at OTC, and I know that his future truly does look bright.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southwell has received six scholarships during his short role as a college student, and he has applied for more than that. One of his favorite bits of advice &amp;mdash; other than knowing that you won&amp;rsquo;t win if you never apply &amp;mdash; is to take advantage of the letters of recommendation, which often don&amp;rsquo;t have word limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If there&amp;rsquo;s something you want to say in your essay but don&amp;rsquo;t have the room, ask your recommender to include it in their letter,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I gave my instructor two pages of notes, and she wrote a detailed letter of recommendation three pages long. Far from being pretentious, recommenders love this because it gives them something to write about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip: be proud of being a community college student. Also, be flexible. Southwell was willing to prolong his graduation in order to spend two full semesters in South Africa. And finally, get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a non-traditional student, being a member in Phi Theta Kappa is essential because scholarship committees traditionally look at a student&amp;rsquo;s high school accomplishments to determine their academic merit,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have the advantage of a strong high school transcript, so joining Phi Theta Kappa is a way of showing I&amp;rsquo;m a student who takes advantage of the resources available to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.borenawards.org/boren_scholarship/current_scholars.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;See the full list of 2014 Boren Scholars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-11-25T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, November 25, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to peek inside the mind of a Phi Theta Kappa &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark"&gt;Hallmark Award&lt;/a&gt; judge? What secrets could he or she share that could improve your submissions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not alone, and this isn&amp;rsquo;t one-sided. After decades of applications, common issues have arisen that Hallmark Award judges would like to share. Here are some things the judges wish you knew, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When answering questions about an individual award nominee, use specific facts to back up the person&amp;rsquo;s qualities. Saying &amp;lsquo;so and so has done wonderful things for the chapter&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t enough; tell us what the wonderful things are. Quotes are also great when describing the influence the individual has had on others. Avoid using generic descriptions that aren&amp;rsquo;t useful in evaluating the person&amp;rsquo;s impact on a chapter, such as &amp;lsquo;Her smile lights up a room,&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;He&amp;rsquo;s the nicest person in our chapter.&amp;rsquo; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For the Honors in Action Project Award and the College Project Award, we need to learn about the &lt;em&gt;processes&lt;/em&gt; people engaged in, not simply the end results of the processes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We can tell that you use a thesaurus to look for various ways to convey the same thought. Be sure your message is still the same and makes sense when using words or phrases from a thesaurus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The word count limit is not a required word count. Don&amp;#39;t use fluff and filler that detracts from the content of your chapter&amp;#39;s accomplishments just because you have a certain number of words allotted for the application responses. Keep your writing clean, clear and concise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Judges read a specific award category, not ALL of your chapter&amp;#39;s award entries. So please don&amp;#39;t assume we will know what you wrote about in your Honors in Action Project entry when writing your Distinguished Chapter Officer entry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;#39;t assume we know your local community partners by just providing their acronym. Spell it out first, and then you can use initials in all other references to save on word counts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On Honors in Action projects specifically, do your research first. We can tell when it&amp;rsquo;s an afterthought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Although we do not designate a specific formatting form for documenting your sources, pick a style and stick to it (APA style for example).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When it comes to sources, be creative &amp;mdash; sources can be found everywhere. Think outside the box and use sources like personal interviews and surveys, in addition to academic journals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Use sources that show you actually researched the Honors Study Topic theme, meaning that all of your sources do not point to one opinion or conclusion. Show us that you looked into varying perspectives on a topic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please, please, please proofread your entries before sending. Although grammar and punctuation only account for a small number of points, these points are sometimes the difference between winning entries and non-winning entries.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t assume you&amp;rsquo;ve hit all of the key points on the Judging Rubric until you have someone completely unfamiliar with your project or individual&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments &amp;lsquo;grade&amp;rsquo; your entry using the rubric. They&amp;rsquo;ll be able to spot holes you weren&amp;rsquo;t even aware of because you know the project/person so well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When judging, I always have the rubric in front of me. Award entries that go specifically by the rubric are so easy for me to judge. I look at the rubric, and I see that the answer is in the nomination &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s scored! I move on!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When nominating advisors for awards, always check to see what they have accomplished prior to your joining the chapter.&amp;nbsp;If an advisor has previously held a leadership role in the organization, it will definitely add points to their score.&amp;nbsp;Not mentioning previous accomplishments indicates to the reader that you do not know the advisor very well or that you did not do your homework.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Administrator Hallmark Awards are due by 5 pm CST December 10. Individual Awards are due by 5 pm CST January 14, 2015, and Chapter Awards are due by 5 pm CST January 28, 2015. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This marks the first time that system-wide, coordinated efforts have been held to promote completion at Mississippi&amp;rsquo;s community colleges (MSC4). In Mississippi, more than 2,000 students committed to complete their degrees or credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is very important for our community college students to complete their degrees or certificates once they enroll at one of our colleges,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Eric Clark, Executive Director of the Mississippi Community College Board. &amp;ldquo;Many studies have shown the positive benefits of graduating from a community college, and I commend each of our Phi Theta Kappa chapters for engaging all students, faculty members, and advisors on this very important issue.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Council of County Colleges&amp;rsquo; (NJCCC) Center for Student Success partnered with the New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) for the second consecutive year to sponsor New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s statewide Phi Theta Kappa Community College Completion Challenge (NJC4). All 19 New Jersey community colleges across the state hosted a series of campus-based college completion activities during the week of October 27-31. The initiative culminated at the Phi Theta Kappa Middle States Region Honors in Action Conference at Bergen Community College in Lyndhurst on Saturday, November 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle States Regional Coordinator Pattie Van Atter reported that in New Jersey more than 14,000 community college students had pledged to complete a college credential, with nearly 1,000 faculty members committing to be &amp;quot;completion champions&amp;quot; who help them reach their goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s events in Mississippi and New Jersey also incorporated CollegeFish.org, the Phi Theta Kappa website designed to help all community college students prepare to transfer to four-year colleges and universities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;We are excited about NJC4 at New Jersey&amp;rsquo;s 19 community colleges,&amp;rdquo; said NJCCC President Dr. Lawrence A. Nespoli. &amp;ldquo;The addition of CollegeFish to the initiative will only enhance the program and allow us to help the students make accurate, informed decisions when planning to transfer to four-year colleges and universities to earn their bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both New Jersey and Mississippi, individual Phi Theta Kappa chapters were in charge of leading their college&amp;rsquo;s events. Programs included speakers on completion and transfer, student commit to complete pledges, faculty and staff completion champion signing ceremonies, college transfer and career fairs, increased emphasis on the advising process, and social activities such as wellness fairs and a 5K run/walk with a &amp;ldquo;Finish the Race&amp;rdquo; theme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Phi Theta Kappa chapters put a creative twist on the C4 initiative, hosting events such as faculty &amp;ldquo;Lunch and Learns,&amp;rdquo; workshops on specific college majors, &amp;ldquo;Get to Know the College Fish&amp;rdquo; demonstrations, the signing of a ceremonial &amp;ldquo;Finish in 4&amp;rdquo; wall, and a western-themed &amp;ldquo;Happy Trails to Dropouts&amp;rdquo; awareness activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Education Association provided $500 grants to each of its Phi Theta Kappa chapters to help offset the cost of NJC4 activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley, who spoke at one of the events at East Central Community College in Mississippi, said new to the C4 initiative this year was an online pledge that allows the tracking of student progress. This enables faculty to commit themselves as &amp;ldquo;completion champions&amp;rdquo; and expanded guidance for follow-up with students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You will never have an opportunity like you do right now,&amp;quot; Risley told East Central students. &amp;quot;Once you make your commitment to complete your degree, seek out an advisor, an instructor, a coach&amp;hellip;and tell them you&amp;rsquo;ve made your commitment and you need their help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, additional statewide C4 events are being planned in 11 other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national Community College Completion Initiative began in April 2010 when leaders from Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, the American Association of Community Colleges, the Association of Community College Trustees, the League for Innovation in the Community College, and the Center for Community College Student Engagement signed Democracy&amp;rsquo;s Colleges: A Call to Action. The Community College Completion Challenge website, cccompletionchallenge.org, showcase the missions, action plans and strategies developed by each organization to involve their constituents to produce 5 million more associate degree and certificate holders by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read news coverage of the New Jersey C4 event &lt;a href="http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2014/10/26/need-students-finish-college/17781279/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; and view videos of the events on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hbiESVEApg"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.

     <title>2014 New Century Scholar Shares Scholarship Advice</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/ncs-shares-scholarship-advice 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-11-20T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Thursday, November 20, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application&lt;/a&gt; has awarded millions of dollars in scholarships to hundreds of two-year college students &amp;mdash; most of them Phi Theta Kappa members. In 2015, approximately $520,000 will be added to the total, and more than 285 students will join the ranks of winning scholars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Izuchukwu%20Abel.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Izuchukwu%20Abel.JPG?itok=-uQm8s2z" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014 New Century Scholar Izuchukwu Abel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it take to join that list? Izuchukwu Abel knows &amp;mdash; he was named a 2014 New Century Scholar and received a $2,000 scholarship, and he has advice for creating a winning scholarship application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The essay is the most crucial part of a good scholarship application,&amp;rdquo; Abel said. &amp;ldquo;The essay is the opportunity to make your case that you are the student the scholarship provider is looking for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abel was born in Nigeria and came to the United States in October 2009. In the fall of 2010, he enrolled at the Community College of the District of Columbia, where he has been working toward a degree in nursing. He is the first in his family to go to college, and he will transfer to a four-year university in January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 he joined the staff of the Symbral Foundation, where he works as a counselor for the mentally disabled community in Washington, D.C. and its metropolitan areas. He also volunteers with Community of Hope, an organization that provides support for individuals and families suffering from poverty, homelessness, addiction, mental illness and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abel was inducted into the Beta Sigma Upsilon Chapter in 2011, and in 2012 he received a Coca-Cola Leaders of Promise Scholarship after submitting the Spring Scholarship Application. He went on to be named a 2013 Oberndorf Scholar as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;(These scholarships have been) very helpful because they have assisted me to have more time to study and volunteer instead of working overtime to make ends meet,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Most important, these have gone a long way in making my short-term dream of being the first in my family to obtain a college degree a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can vividly recall that, as a kid, I have always had the passion to help people; therefore, getting this degree will aid me in my hunger to serve in the community and become a philanthropist in the long run.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having successfully received three Phi Theta Kappa-administered scholarships, Abel has five tips for students applying for the Fall Scholarship Application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Know the requirement.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s imperative to realize that every scholarship provider is looking for a specific student who meets distinctive criteria. When you get your application, look closely at the questions, the organization giving the scholarship and any past recipients you can find.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make your case in your essay. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;For me, the essay is the best chance to make the case for why you should receive the scholarship. It helps the scholarship provider to learn about the person behind the application.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Make it personal. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that the main purpose of your essay is to convince the scholarship provider that you&amp;rsquo;re the student they&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Start your application on time. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Begin your application as early as possible to enable you to write and organize your essay along with other materials that may be needed, i.e. recommendation letters, transcripts, etc.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Proofread your essay. &amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;Getting a teacher, friends or a good grammar editor will go a long way in making sure your essay is not derailed by spelling mistakes or awkward sentences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember &amp;mdash; the Fall Scholarship Application closes at 5 p.m. CST on Monday, December 1.&lt;/strong&gt; The application is for students who are almost finished with their associate degree coursework and intend to enter the workforce or transfer to a four-year college in the upcoming academic year. &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Learn more, and apply today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They will each receive a $1,000 scholarship to aid in the completion of their associate degree and/or their transfer to a four-year college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scholarships were made possible by the support of the following four-year colleges and universities who served as sponsors of Community College Completion and Transfer Month:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spring Hill College, Alabama&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menlo College, California&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loyola Marymount University, California&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cornell College, Iowa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elmhurst College, Illinois&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Morehead State University, Kentucky&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hamline University, Minnesota&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mississippi University for Women, Mississippi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Belhaven University, Mississippi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rowan University, New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drew University, New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LIM College, New York&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Utica College, New York&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long Island University, New York&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;John Carroll University, Ohio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warner Pacific College, Oregon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeSales University, Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;University of Texas at Tyler, Texas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Southwestern University, Texas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dallas Baptist University, Texas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Westminster College, Utah&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Champlain College, Vermont&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are grateful for the generous support of these colleges and universities, and we are proud to join with them and support college completion and transfer for these two students,&amp;rdquo; said Ron Filipowicz, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of College Relations. &amp;ldquo;Student success and college completion are at the heart of what we at Phi Theta Kappa do, and we are excited to be able to offer programs and tools such as CollegeFish.org to help make college completion and transfer easier for every two-year college student.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community College Completion and Transfer Month featured themed weeks relating to college completion and transfer. Webinars were hosted throughout the month on such topics as Scholarship Tips &amp;amp; Tricks and Resume &amp;amp; Essay 101, in addition to general information on CollegeFish.org such as how to set up a profile and find your best-fit scholarships and colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students could qualify for the scholarship by creating a CollegeFish.org profile; logging in to CollegeFish.org in the month of October; liking the CollegeFish Facebook page and posting their name, college and email; and attending a webinar and providing their name, college and email. Qiao and Bay were randomly selected from more than 2,100 participating students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When students invest time and energy into exploring the transfer scholarships and opportunities in CollegeFish.org, there is great potential for reward,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Blalock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Support Officer. &amp;ldquo;Through events like Community College Completion and Transfer Month, our goal is to make sure all two-year college students know the tools that are available to them through CollegeFish.org so they can receive the greatest reward possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two more $1,000 scholarships will be given away in February 2015 as CollegeFish.org hosts Fishpalooza Financial Literacy February. The month-long event will feature contests, webinars and more to master the basics of personal finance, college savings and making smart college tuition financial decisions. More details will be shared in the coming weeks on Facebook and in the Golden Key News Briefs email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, be sure to check out CollegeFish.org&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Twelve Days of Transfer,&amp;rdquo; beginning December 1. Each day, a different Fish Fanatic &amp;mdash; Phi Theta Kappa and two-year college alumni &amp;mdash; will share a transfer tip on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/collegefish"&gt;CollegeFish Facebook page.&lt;/a&gt; Be sure to &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; the page so you don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on a single tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment on the tip and the day&amp;rsquo;s trivia question to be entered into a drawing for one of 13 gift cards. One student will win each day. There will be additional chances to win live by attending a CollegeFish webinar on December 2 and 9. Times will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-11-19T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Wednesday, November 19, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members and advisors from some of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s top chapters may bring different strengths to achieving success, but they all agree on one thing: support from their college presidents and administrators is crucial in reaching their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/img_judy_merritt.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/img_judy_merritt.jpg?itok=Ck1zcNIN" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late Dr. Judy Merritt was a 2012 recipient of the Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our college president plays a huge role in allowing our chapter to exceed the normal expectations,&amp;rdquo; said Jared Steele, president of the Alpha Zeta Eta Chapter at North Lake College in Texas, of their college president, Christa Slejko. &amp;ldquo;She compliments our work and opens doors that would we would have otherwise never seen.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas chapter was named Fifth Finalist in the 2014 Most Distinguished Chapter &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/docs/awards/2014_awards_program.pdf"&gt;Hallmark Awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juliana F. Vianna, president of the chapter at Valencia College &amp;ndash; Osceola Campus in Florida, agrees. She pointed out that their provost, Dr. Kathleen Plinske, serves as keynote speaker for chapter induction ceremonies, sharing her personal story and encouraging all new inductees to be active participants in Phi Theta Kappa. The Alpha Phi Zeta Chapter was named First Runner-Up to the Most Distinguished Chapter during NerdNation 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When we met with her to plan our college project, she gave us a huge opportunity to organize an event that introduced about 1,300 high school juniors to our campus,&amp;rdquo; Vianna said. &amp;ldquo;We gave them a tour and also had many professors volunteer to teach a class based on their selected majors, so they could see what college is like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our college president truly cares about the growth of our chapter. She always makes herself available to discuss ideas and projects with us. We truly couldn&amp;rsquo;t ask for a better college president.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Pi Pi and Beta Lambda Delta chapters at Jefferson State Community College in Alabama were greatly saddened by the recent death of their long-time college president, Dr. Judy Merritt. But they never had to wonder whether they had her full support &amp;ndash; she made that readily apparent during her 35-year tenure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both chapters have a long history of excellence, garnering Most Distinguished Chapter awards and running successful international officer campaigns. Their advisors have also gone on to play important leadership roles in Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Merritt &amp;mdash; affectionately known as Judy &amp;mdash; gave all Phi Theta Kappa officers a full tuition and fees scholarship, and she fully supported our travel and our projects,&amp;rdquo; said Liesl W. Harris, advisor to the Beta Lambda Delta Chapter. &amp;ldquo;More importantly, however, she believed in Phi Theta Kappa and the Society&amp;rsquo;s ideals. She was a passionate advocate for us. Our chapter would not have been nearly as successful had it not been for her unwavering support.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former Pi Pi chapter advisor and Alabama Regional Coordinator, Dr. Jo Marshall understands the power of a college president to impact not only the lives of students, but faculty as well. She currently serves as a Phi Theta Kappa Foundation Trustee and President of Somerset Community College in Kentucky and credits Merritt with teaching her a great deal about leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Judy Merritt was my college president for 20 years. I always knew that I had her support in all aspects of college life. She valued academic standards and student involvement in campus life. She especially supported our Pi Pi Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa,&amp;rdquo; Marshall said. &amp;ldquo;In addition to her financial support, she provided the members and advisors opportunities for travel, professional development and her personal time to encourage all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She served as a sounding board and a mentor for me. Judy encouraged me to continue my education and pursue career goals. I learned from her the art of leadership by believing in the limitless possibilities of individuals. She loved her faculty, staff and students, and we loved her. She was an excellent leader, and Jefferson State Community College and I will definitely miss her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the life of Dr. Judy Merritt &lt;a href="http://obits.al.com/obituaries/birmingham/obituary.aspx?pid=172879339"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. She was also a recipient of the Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction, which honors college presidents for their support of Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters are encouraged to recognize their supportive college presidents and administrators by nominating them for&lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark"&gt; Hallmark Administrator Awards&lt;/a&gt; by December 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Twenty community college students were selected to receive $2,500 each for completion of associate degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Lanza Scholarship program targets part-time, full-time and international students who have completed 50 percent of their course work toward an associate degree in nursing, emergency medical services or respiratory care programs offered by regionally accredited community colleges. Phi Theta Kappa membership is not part of the application or judging criteria; however, the majority of the 2014 recipients were Society members. A panel of independent judges selected the recipients by application based on academic and leadership endeavors as well as community service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/2014-Frank-Lanza-Memorial-Scholars"&gt;2014 winners&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Laura Chamberlin&lt;br /&gt;Maria College-Albany&lt;br /&gt;New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kimberly Coffland&lt;br /&gt;Montgomery County Community College-Blue Bell&lt;br /&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Deanna Corder&lt;br /&gt;Blue Ridge Community College-Weyers Cave&lt;br /&gt;Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kimberly Creasman&lt;br /&gt;Valencia College-Orlando&lt;br /&gt;Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jaebyn Drake&lt;br /&gt;Klamath Community College-Klamath Falls&lt;br /&gt;Oregon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Heather Fast&lt;br /&gt;Riverland Community College-Austin&lt;br /&gt;Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Shirley Maria Flor Frias&lt;br /&gt;Tidewater Community College-Portsmouth&lt;br /&gt;Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Pamela Jones&lt;br /&gt;Athens Technical College-Athens&lt;br /&gt;Georgia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Terry King&lt;br /&gt;Holmes Community College-Grenada&lt;br /&gt;Mississippi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jacqueline Kreider&lt;br /&gt;Fox Valley Technical College-Appleton&lt;br /&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Tamar Mosulishvili&lt;br /&gt;Borough of Manhattan Community College-New York&lt;br /&gt;New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Kristie Mourani&lt;br /&gt;Orange Coast College-Costa Mesa&lt;br /&gt;California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dan Nguyen&lt;br /&gt;Wayne County Community College-Downtown&lt;br /&gt;Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Nneka Nweke&lt;br /&gt;Johnston Community College-Smithfield&lt;br /&gt;North Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jeanelle Pestes&lt;br /&gt;Walla Walla Community College-Walla Walla&lt;br /&gt;Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dawn Simone&lt;br /&gt;Johnston Community College-Smithfield&lt;br /&gt;North Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Moya Stewart-Gray&lt;br /&gt;Middlesex County College-Edison&lt;br /&gt;New Jersey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dorothy Storey&lt;br /&gt;Northeast Alabama Community College-Rainsville&lt;br /&gt;Alabama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Keri Thompson&lt;br /&gt;Labette Community College-Parsons&lt;br /&gt;Kansas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ildiko Yuryev&lt;br /&gt;Cuyahoga Community College-Eastern&lt;br /&gt;Ohio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;quot;Funding provided for these scholarships is critical to helping community college students meet the high cost of completing these rigorous health-related programs,&amp;quot; said Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Executive Director and CEO, Dr. Rod A. Risley. &amp;ldquo;Healthcare is among the top majors for today&amp;rsquo;s community college students and also for our Phi Theta Kappa members, so it&amp;rsquo;s important that we help these students complete their degrees and become a vibrant part of the economy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Frank Lanza served in the U.S. Coast Guard during the Korean War. He was a member of the board of directors for the Coast Guard Foundation and received the 2003 Distinguished Corporate Leadership award from the Soldiers&amp;#39;, Sailors&amp;#39;, Marines&amp;#39; and Airmen&amp;#39;s Club. Lanza was also a member of the board of governors for the Aerospace Industries Association and the American Italian Cancer Foundation. A philanthropist, he and his wife supported a variety of charities through a family foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Lanza founded L-3 Communications in 1997, a global aerospace and defense company that has grown to $15 billion in annual revenues and employs approximately 66,000 people worldwide. With its corporate headquarters in New York City, L-3 is a leader in C3ISR systems (command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), aircraft modernization and maintenance, government services and specialized products that serve the military, homeland security, aviation and other commercial markets. L-3 customers include the U.S. Department of Defense, other U.S. government agencies, allied foreign governments and commercial customers. Under his leadership as chairman and CEO, L-3 became the nation&amp;#39;s sixth largest defense contractor, comprised of more than 73 operating units, among them Medical Education Technologies, Inc. (METI), now known as CAE Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In honor of Lanza&amp;#39;s visionary business leadership and generous commitment to charitable causes, Lou Oberndorf, founder and retired Chairman of METI, initiated the endowment of the Frank Lanza Memorial Scholarship, which was funded by L-3 Communications, CAE Healthcare, AACC, and Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. Oberndorf and his wife, Rosemary, also recently established the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Based in Washington, D.C., AACC is the primary advocacy organization for community colleges at the national level and works closely with directors of state offices to inform and to affect state policy. AACC represents almost 1,200 two-year, associate degree-granting institutions and more than 11 million students. Community colleges are the largest and fastest-growing sector of U.S. higher education, enrolling close to half (43 percent) of all U.S. undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. Nearly 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 131,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>International Officer Named Illinois Student Laureate</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/trevor-mileur-student-laureate 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-11-11T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, November 11, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Division III International Vice President Trevor Mileur has been named a 2014 Lincoln Academy of Illinois Student Laureate. He was the only community college student in his state selected for this honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/IMG_0072.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/IMG_0072.JPG?itok=skeUTZgi" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division III International Vice President Trevor Mileur with Illinois Central College Vice Presdient of Student Services Dr. Tracy Morris, left, and Vice Chancellor of the Lincoln Academy William Bennett, right&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a huge honor and a humbling experience,&amp;rdquo; Mileur said. &amp;ldquo;The award is well-known throughout the state, but it&amp;rsquo;s not something you can set out to achieve. While I was recognized specifically, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a reflection of the work of my college as well as the other community colleges.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mileur was elected to international office during NerdNation 2014, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention, in April in Orlando, Florida. He is serving a one-year term in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lincoln Academy recognizes students at the top of their class for excellence in curricular and extracurricular activities. The awards are presented to seniors from each of the state&amp;rsquo;s four-year, degree-granting colleges and universities and to one student from among the community colleges in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mileur is a student at Illinois Central College (ICC). He was selected from among nominations from the state&amp;rsquo;s 48 community colleges to the Illinois Community College Board to represent the Illinois Community College System as Student Laureate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each student receives a Student Laureate Medallion along with a $1,000 educational grant and a certificate of achievement. The Academy recognized students during the annual Student Laureate Convocation November 1 at the Old State Capitol State Historic Site in Springfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mileur is an engineering student who maintains a 3.6 grade point average. He is highly engaged in campus and community affairs and participates in many activities that require state, regional and international travel.

     <title>Best Practices: Avoid Common Errors in Scholarship Applications</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/common-scholarship-app-errors 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-11-07T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Friday, November 7, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With approximately $520,000 available on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application&lt;/a&gt; for students preparing to complete a certificate or associate degree or planning to transfer to a four-year college or university, it is imperative that your scholarship application be as error-free as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is your one chance to make a good impression on the judges,&amp;rdquo; said Christin Grissom, Director of Scholarship Operations. &amp;ldquo;You want to make sure your thoughts are well organized and your application is grammatically correct, and you&amp;rsquo;ll want to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;re presenting yourself and your accomplishments in the best possible way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 11 tips to keep in mind that will help you avoid some of the more commonly made scholarship application errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do not submit an incomplete application.&lt;/strong&gt; Even forgetting one part of a multi-part question or document will disqualify you. Avoid answering questions with an answer of N/A or none. An incomplete application is as good as NO application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make sure you meet the eligibility criteria. &lt;/strong&gt;If an application says you need to obtain a degree in a specific timeframe, make sure you will do so. The instructions are specific &amp;mdash; eligibility criteria are different for each scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. When writing an essay, be sure to focus your essay. &lt;/strong&gt;If you are asked to write about one significant activity, focus your essay on one strong activity rather than mentioning several activities. You may only get 500 words &amp;mdash; do not use them writing a small amount about a lot of things you did. Take one activity and show how you applied your education and leadership skills to benefit your college, community or society. Show originality, be specific, show creativity, and show how you used your education, how you left an impact and how your college or community will be left better off once you graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Review your transcript. &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure you know how many credits you&amp;rsquo;ve completed, how many of those courses are remedial/developmental, your GPA and number of withdrawals. Remember that withdrawals may count against you if the scholarship program is academically rigorous. Do not shy away from challenging courses, especially math and science, as completion of courses like these can help strengthen your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Do not embellish your story. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Avoid embellishments in your application, as scholarship entries are often fact checked. For example, All-USA applicants go through a rigorous screening process by USA TODAY. Even the smallest embellishment can cause your application to be disqualified. If you win, there will be a thorough check of all information included in your application. Do not &amp;ldquo;fudge&amp;rdquo; facts. Be certain you can back up anything you put in your application. In addition, do not submit any information if you do not want it to become public knowledge. Many applications, especially national or extremely rigorous, may be made available to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Submit transcripts from all schools. &lt;/strong&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Fall Scholarship Application requires transcripts from every school you have attended in the last five years. If they are over five years old, you do not need to submit them. However, check your current transcript &amp;mdash; does is show that you transferred credits? If those credits do not show when they were taken, submit a transcript. Read the directions of the application &amp;mdash; it is always better to err on the side of too many transcripts than not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Haste makes waste! &lt;/strong&gt;Applications filled out and submitted close to the deadline are usually incomplete, and you will not have enough time to create and edit several drafts. Applications need to be COMPLETED by the deadline &amp;mdash; keep technology challenges and timing delays in mind to minimize the risk of not having your application completed on time. Take your time to fill out applications, be aware of the deadline and give yourself plenty of time to complete them. Remember, if you snooze, you lose!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Be certain to provide a phone number or an email that will follow you over several months.&lt;/strong&gt; If your contact information changes, be sure to contact the scholarship provider to ensure that you receive future communications about the status of your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Avoid writing sob stories. &lt;/strong&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s true that a person who has overcome much has an impressive story, writing about a sob story without articulating how the situation encouraged you to identify and address a need is not enough to win. You need the grades, the service learning and involvement to strengthen your application. Articulate the impact of your story, how you have overcome and what you have done to address the situation. Judges are impressed by the quality and nature of your story as well as the steps you have taken to impact others and leave a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Proofread Multiple Times! &lt;/strong&gt;Simple mistakes are easy to overlook but can hinder the strength and impact of your scholarship application. Contact others to help proofread your application, and use online proofreading sites to help you check spelling and grammar usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Student Assessments need to support what you write. &lt;/strong&gt;Your Student Assessment about your significant activity is almost as important as the essay you write. Choose a recommender that can provide specific and pertinent information to back up the activity you discuss in your essay. Explain the criteria of the award. Give recommenders ample time to compose your assessment and remember to send thank-you letters afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deadline for the Fall Scholarship Application is December 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The scholars were selected through a rigorous application process based on knowledge of the 2014/2015 Honors Study Topic, &lt;em&gt;Frontiers and the Spirit of Exploration,&lt;/em&gt; and demonstrated excellence in teaching or administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the strength of their applications, the selection committee also considered where the applicant lives, the Phi Theta Kappa division in which they advise, the teaching or professional discipline and the variety in terms of the number of years the applicant has served as a chapter advisor. The result is a strong, diverse group of Faculty Scholars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We congratulate them for being selected to serve and for their willingness and desire to surpass the traditional duties of an advisor by contributing in this manner,&amp;rdquo; said Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those selected as Faculty Scholars are eight advisors who were chosen to serve on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Honors Program Council. Members of the council serve four-year terms and help assess the Society&amp;rsquo;s honors programming. They will also be charged with developing the 2016/2017 Honors Study Topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2015 Faculty Scholars, along with their community college, state and academic field, are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Boehm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jefferson State Community College, Alabama&lt;br /&gt;English&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michele Daniels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kilgore College, Texas&lt;br /&gt;Speech Communication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Fritts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ozarks Technical and Community College, Missouri&lt;br /&gt;American Sign Language/Counseling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo Fritts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ozarks Technical and Community College, Missouri&lt;br /&gt;Leadership/ASL&lt;br /&gt;Honors Program Council&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Patty Hall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cañada College, California&lt;br /&gt;Early Childhood Education&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margo Hamm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somerset Community College, Kentucky&lt;br /&gt;Library Science&lt;br /&gt;Honors Program Council&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda Lilgreen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normandale Community College, Minnesota&lt;br /&gt;Student Life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeanette Milius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iowa Western Community College, Iowa&lt;br /&gt;Business/Accounting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Myrick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oklahoma City Community College, Oklahoma&lt;br /&gt;Economics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sarah Nichols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hinds Community College &amp;ndash; Vicksburg, Mississippi&lt;br /&gt;Psychology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Michael Odu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillsborough Community College, Florida&lt;br /&gt;Mathematics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Parrett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabethtown Community &amp;amp; Technical College, Kentucky&lt;br /&gt;Physical Sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacklyn Pierce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake-Sumter State College, Florida&lt;br /&gt;English&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cassandra Powell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard J.

Stimers&amp;rsquo; registration, airfare and hotel for NerdNation 2015 will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group will attend the annual Faculty Scholar Conference at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Center for Excellence in Jackson, Mississippi, January 29-February 1.

     <title>Key Qualities of an International Officer</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/qualities-of-a-good-IO 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-30T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, October 30, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving as an International Officer is the highest level of student leadership available within Phi Theta Kappa, and it no doubt requires a special kind of person to hold the office successfully. It&amp;rsquo;s an incredible opportunity; and while the requirements are many and can be difficult, the rewards are immeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/group_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/group_0.jpg?itok=2wR8Lqja" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014-2015 International Officer Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being an International Officer has given me the opportunity to meet people from different parts of the world, and to me that is priceless,&amp;rdquo; said 2014-2015 International Vice President for Division II Jesus Tovar. &amp;ldquo;Also, the support and reception of the members has been beyond anything I expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I ran for International Office knowing that it would be a good experience, but I never imagined it would be this good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/about/international-officers"&gt;International Officers&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; an International President and one Vice President from each of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s four divisions &amp;mdash; will be elected to a one-year term during &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org"&gt;NerdNation 2015,&lt;/a&gt; April 16-18 in San Antonio, Texas. Students interested in seeking international office can &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/get-involved/campaign-for-an-office/international-officer/packet-request-form"&gt;request a candidate application.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Officer Team presides over NerdNation and Honors Institute. They represent Phi Theta Kappa at regional meetings at educational conferences throughout their year in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our International Officer Team loves to spend time with each other, but by far our favorite aspect of this experience is connecting with members, hearing the stories they share, and the moments we share with them,&amp;rdquo; said Division III Vice President Trevor Mileur. &amp;ldquo;There are so many members who want to cheer you on and connect with you. The support is amazing!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawneen Banks, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development for Division IV who oversees the International Officer candidacy process, said that while serving as an International Officer may seem glamorous, it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that, first and foremost, the officers are ambassadors for and liaisons to Society Headquarters. She counts humility as well as &amp;ldquo;the ability to listen with the intent to understand&amp;rdquo; among the top qualities of a good International Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Their ability to communicate clearly the experiences of members, advisors and college representatives enables us to better serve our constituents,&amp;rdquo; said Banks, herself a former International Officer. &amp;ldquo;Utilize this leadership opportunity to learn from others and grow from what you do not know. Be open to new ideas and perspectives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International President Ebonee Carpenter added that a good International Officer should be team-oriented, approachable and flexible. She likens the experience to an actual job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once elected as an International Officer, you immediately become part of a team,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;You have your own personal goals, but also the goals of your team. Everything you do is a reflection of both yourself and the team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many International Officers have held leadership positions on chapter and/or regional levels, previous leadership experience &amp;mdash; while helpful &amp;mdash; is not required when seeking international office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa is a great organization that allows students to develop their leadership abilities in a real world setting, while providing a welcoming environment for growth and enhancement,&amp;rdquo; Carpenter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division IV Vice President Ivette Piña held leadership positions in high school but was a fairly new college student and Phi Theta Kappa member when she decided to seek international office. Nevertheless, she won the support of hundreds of members while campaigning during NerdNation 2014 in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I myself had no idea what I was doing when I ran for (International Office), but I knew I had experience in being a leader with student council in high school,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;You have to be able to step down and be a group of leaders with the other (International Officers) and take into consideration that you&amp;rsquo;re a group of leaders serving as one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key quality of a successful International Officer &amp;mdash; much like that of a successful college student &amp;mdash; is time management. The position involves a good amount of travel to regional and international events, as well as to training sessions at the Center for Excellence in Jackson, Mississippi. There are also hours spent in meetings, preparing presentations, and writing and giving speeches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Time management is a struggle,&amp;rdquo; said Division I Vice President Megan Giles. &amp;ldquo;Many (International Officers) have been parents, students, full-time employees and volunteers, among many other things. It is important to create structure and routine to fulfill your duties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks recommends having an open and honest discussion with family, friends, teachers and coworkers about the commitment required of International Officers. All requirements are detailed on the International Officer Candidate Application so candidates know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is time spent away from school, work and family, and it requires a significant commitment; but, it yields an even greater reward,&amp;rdquo; said Mia Ramos-Shirley, Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development for Division III. Ramos-Shirley works directly with the International Officers and is a former International Officer herself. &amp;ldquo;If you are interested in seeking International Office, you must first answer one simple question: Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In other words, what motivations are compelling you to dedicate a year of your life to serving as an International Officer? This question will define your journey to pursuing International Office in Phi Theta Kappa.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Phi Theta Kappa Supports Completion, Awards $7,000 to Oberndorf Scholars</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/Oberndorf-Scholarship-Winners-Announced 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-29T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, October 29, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, MS &amp;ndash; Seven Phi Theta Kappa members have been selected as &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/2014-Spring-Oberndorf-Scholar"&gt;Oberndorf Scholars &lt;/a&gt;and awarded a total of $7,000 in scholarships. The scholars receive scholarships of $1,000 each to complete their associate degree or certificate studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/oberndorf"&gt;Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; helps Phi Theta Kappa members overcome unanticipated financial barriers preventing the completion of the first college credential, an associate degree or certificate, while enrolled in the two-year college. This scholarship was created through a collaborative effort between benefactors Rosemary and Lou Oberndorf, the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation and the 2011-2012 International Officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011 Lou and Rosemary Oberndorf challenged the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation to raise $125,000 in order to receive a one-to-one challenge grant. When it was announced that the challenge was met at the 2012 Annual Convention, the Oberndorf&amp;rsquo;s challenged the Foundation to raise another $125,000, which they matched one-to-one, resulting in a total $500,000 endowment for the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are very grateful to Rosemary and Lou Oberndorf and donors to the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation for meeting the challenge to create an endowment and making these scholarships available to our members,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley. &amp;ldquo;Congratulations to our recipients. Without a doubt the Oberndorf Scholarships will make a tremendous impact on the lives of these hard-working, high-achieving students &amp;mdash; making it possible for them to complete their associate degrees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship recipients are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karina Aguilar, Mesa Community College, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda Galo, American Samoa Community College, American Samoa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Glynn, Southern Maine Community College, Maine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peggy Hicks, Lone Star College - CyFair, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Johnson, Central Carolina Technical College, South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quan Nguyen, Bunker Hill Community College, Massachusetts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Randal, San Antonio College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every Phi Theta Kappa member, advisor, alumnus and administrator has the ability to make a difference for students struggling to complete,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Foundation CEO Dr. Nancy Rieves. &amp;ldquo;We are so grateful to all the donors who are making these dreams of college completion come true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is focused on long-term financial stability for Phi Theta Kappa. It is dependent upon the generosity of individuals, organizations, foundations and corporations to ensure its future through the support of existing and the establishment of new endowment funds.

     <title>Workshops Help Kentucky Chapter Increase CollegeFish.org Awareness</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/chapter-increases-collegefish-awareness 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-28T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Tuesday, October 28, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter successfully enrolled more than 800 students from Bluegrass Community and Technical College in Kentucky in &lt;a href="http://www.collegefish.org"&gt;CollegeFish.org&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; more than any other Phi Theta Kappa chapter in the world. This year, they&amp;rsquo;re shooting for a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/group%20one.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/group%20one.jpg?itok=klfppEcm" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter holds a series of workshops to help more students realize the benefits of CollegeFish.org, which offers all two-year college students the opportunity to begin planning for the completion of their associate degree and preparing to successfully transfer to the four-year program of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;d already been hosting workshops on different topics like C4 and talking about CollegeFish.org in our chapter meetings,&amp;rdquo; said chapter advisor Cindy Baker. &amp;ldquo;But when our state became one of the first to allow all community college students to use CollegeFish.org, these new workshops just seemed like a natural step for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout October, CollegeFish.org has celebrated Community College Completion and Transfer Month. A series of webinars has featured a variety of topics related to college transfer and completion, including one on October 21 that was hosted by the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter and focused on their successful campus-wide rollout of CollegeFish.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hard work and enthusiasm of the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter is such an inspiration,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Blalock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Support Officer. &amp;ldquo;Cindy and her chapter have done an amazing job of increasing awareness of CollegeFish.org at their college, giving their students a better chance of securing a transfer scholarship, completing an associate degree and transferring to the four-year school of their choice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To kick off the campaign, the chapter hosted two workshops for college faculty, staff and administrators that featured Blalock and Joshua Scott Hancock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Associate Director of College Relations. Engaging these key college personnel helped build understanding and enthusiasm, Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the larger workshops for students, the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter incorporated the teaching of a variety of vital college processes, such as setting up a school email account; accessing PeopleSoft, an online program students use to register for classes, view grades and receive information about financial aid; and scheduling an appointment with an academic advisor. All of this information is also important to create a comprehensive CollegeFish.org profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re providing a huge service to the college at the same time,&amp;rdquo; Baker said. &amp;ldquo;Students are getting more involved in their academic planning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faculty members contact the chapter to request that a workshop be hosted for their class. The chapter currently hosts anywhere from five to 15 workshops a week on the college&amp;rsquo;s six campuses. Chapter members first attend training workshops &amp;mdash; offered weekly &amp;mdash; and then take turns leading the CollegeFish.org workshops for their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The workshops last between 30 minutes and an hour and are held in a computer lab when possible; however, because students can also access CollegeFish.org on their smartphones and tablets, a computer lab isn&amp;rsquo;t a necessity. Chapter members walk attendees through the process of creating a CollegeFish.org profile. Gift bags of goldfish crackers and handouts listing a how-to guide to CollegeFish.org and a schedule of any upcoming webinars are distributed, and the attendees&amp;rsquo; email addresses are collected for follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the workshops, CollegeFish Extravaganzas have been held. This is a three- to six-hour drop-in workshop, where chapter members are available to introduce attendees to those vital college processes, enroll them in CollegeFish.org and promote the college scholarships program application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter also set up tables in high-traffic areas on campus to generate interest and increase visibility among students. To garner support from faculty and staff, the chapter hosted a Faculty Appreciation Day during a day of staff meetings. Phi Theta Kappa members set up tables to distribute goldfish crackers, literature about CollegeFish.org and the workshops, and little origami fish as gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Doing the workshops in the instructor&amp;rsquo;s classrooms has allowed us to help many, many more students realize the benefits of CollegeFish,&amp;rdquo; Baker said. &amp;ldquo;Sometimes students need more incentive to do what&amp;rsquo;s good for them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker has also seen the chapter members benefit from the workshops. Leadership skills have been developed, as members have had to prepare for the workshop presentations, improve their communication skills and often overcome a fear of public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All of our members are building these skills that will help them later in life,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It encourages peer-to-peer interaction, and it allows us to promote Phi Theta Kappa and encourage students to engage in some student group, which helps contribute to their success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Engage on International Level for a Strong Chapter</title>

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-23T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, October 23, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting with your peers at the international level can be key for developing a robust Phi Theta Kappa chapter on your campus &amp;mdash; and, it can help fulfill the final level of the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;Five Star Chapter Plan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/crowdCT3_0041_1.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/crowdCT3_0041_1.jpg?itok=1DI2AGkc" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NerdNation 2014 Educational Forum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s important for students to meet others like themselves, to think about topics and to challenge their own points of view and biases,&amp;rdquo; said Paul Roscelli, advisor to the Beta Zeta Nu Chapter at Canada College in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/crowdDSC_1221_1.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/crowdDSC_1221_1.jpg?itok=zvjPPvIL" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;A general session during NerdNation 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With registration for &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org"&gt;NerdNation 2015&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; April 16-18 in San Antonio, Texas &amp;mdash; now open, your chapter can start planning the myriad ways it can connect with Phi Theta Kappa members, advisors, alumni and partners from all over the world in one big weekend. This is also a golden opportunity for your chapter to complete a portion of the Five Star level for the 2015 calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Star Chapter Plan runs on a January-December timeline, and all activities for 2014 must be reported by January 28, 2015. Levels completed in 2015 will be reported in late January 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the same way that classroom instructors provide students with a syllabus at the beginning of each semester, Phi Theta Kappa provides chapters with the Five Star Chapter Plan, which serves as a blueprint for success,&amp;rdquo; said Courtney Lange, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Regional and Chapter Development. &amp;ldquo;And, it&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that students who are engaged and active on their campus are more likely to succeed and complete their course of study.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to submitting at least three entries in the 2015 Hallmark Awards &amp;mdash; including the Honors in Action Project Award, the College Project Award and at least one other individual award &amp;mdash; chapters may choose to attend NerdNation or Honors Institute to round out the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar/requirements#five"&gt;Five Star&lt;/a&gt; requirement. However, an additional option is available if international travel isn&amp;rsquo;t possible or if international events have already been held for the calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how your chapter can still meet the requirement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;all chapter officers must participate in &lt;a href="http://www.collegefish.org"&gt;CollegeFish.org&lt;/a&gt; by completing a profile and putting at least one college in the fishbowl;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;all chapter officers must complete at least one level in &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/competitive-edge"&gt;Competitive Edge;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;all chapter officers must watch a minimum of three Convention and/or Honors Institute videos found at &lt;a href="https://my.ptk.org/edge/my/"&gt;my.ptk.org&lt;/a&gt; under &amp;ldquo;Presentations&amp;rdquo;; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the chapter must submit an entry in the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/get-involved/honors-case-study-challenge"&gt;2014 Honors Case Study Challenge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;rsquo;re working toward the Five Star level for 2014 but missed this year&amp;rsquo;s international events, the options above will help. And as you set your chapter&amp;rsquo;s goal for 2015, plan and budget for an international event if possible. As any chapter member or advisor who has attended an international Phi Theta Kappa event will attest, it&amp;rsquo;s well worth the effort it takes to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Alexander, advisor to the Kappa Alpha Chapter at Holmes Community College &amp;ndash; Goodman in Mississippi, said his chapter regularly sends representatives to international events and has found great success by doing so. The chapter has been named a Top 10 chapter for seven consecutive years and has been named Most Distinguished Chapter twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We feel as though our participation has been a significant contributing factor in our success on the international level,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The impact of these kinds of opportunities extends way beyond the lectures and sessions.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities for advisor and student engagement resulting in long-term chapter and student success are abundant at &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org"&gt;NerdNation,&lt;/a&gt; beginning with the Phi Theta Kappa Academy. Educational Forums allow for small-group discussions on topics ranging from Honors in Action and scholarship opportunities to college transfer tips and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/honors/institute"&gt;Honors Institute,&lt;/a&gt; to be held June 15-20, 2015 at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, is another international event offering opportunities for growth and engagement for both members and advisors. The event is limited to around 500 attendees, giving it a more intimate feel from the start. Students and advisors stay in dormitories and eat in a common dining room, which encourages fellowship and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General session speakers address the current Honors Study Topic in their presentations and allow time for a Q&amp;amp;A with the audience. Following the general sessions, students break into their smaller seminar groups, where further discussion on the speaker&amp;rsquo;s presentation is held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It gives the students the opportunity to grow academically without the stress of a grade, so they can learn and express their opinion in a safe environment,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Mary James, advisor to the Upsilon Eta Chapter at Florida State College at Jacksonville. &amp;ldquo;Since it is an open discussion format, it allows the students the chance to develop a technique to express themselves. I have seen some personal growth in students as well as in myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;View full Five Star Chapter Plan requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; The deadline to report your progress and receive recognition for 2014 activities is &lt;strong&gt;January 28, 2015.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Alum Does the Work, Reaps Big Benefits</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/sara-oswald-feature 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-23T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, October 23, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa alumna Sara Oswald received the email on April 1, 2011. She was convinced it was an April Fools&amp;rsquo; Day prank, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. An admissions advisor from Harvard University&amp;rsquo;s Extension School had in fact emailed her and was urging her to transfer there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/IMG_1095.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/IMG_1095.JPG?itok=mOeikamM" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Alumna Sara Oswald&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was even a scholarship available for someone like her &amp;mdash; a full ride. All she had to do was apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize you could transfer from a technical college to an Ivy League school like Harvard,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not why I signed up for Phi Theta Kappa, but it certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now, people know the possibility is there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She applied for and received the full scholarship to Harvard, which allowed her to complete her entire undergraduate education for less than $2,000. She graduated from Harvard in May 2014 and is now pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree at Columbia College in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done in education keeps coming back to Phi Theta Kappa,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It keeps coming back to when I joined.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald is a &amp;ldquo;seventh-generation South Carolinian&amp;rdquo; who still lives on the same piece of land as those in the first generation. She comes from a &amp;ldquo;family who worked with their hands all their lives,&amp;rdquo; and she&amp;rsquo;s the first in her family to graduate from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her high school years were somewhat lackluster. She didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it because there was no real challenge there, and she graduated in 1998 with a class of about a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My high school counselor didn&amp;rsquo;t even talk to me about college,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;That just wasn&amp;rsquo;t even on my radar. I guess I got lost in the shuffle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years passed before Oswald enrolled at Midlands Technical College (MTC) in Columbia, South Carolina. It was 2008, and she found herself responding well to college courses. Her only goal was to graduate; there was no career goal in sight. Soon, she received her Phi Theta Kappa membership invitation from the Alpha Eta Kappa Chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never in my life did I think an honor society of any sort would be interested in me,&amp;rdquo; Oswald said. &amp;ldquo;I went to the website and did some research on it. Everything about it and four hallmarks spoke to me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald became the first member in her chapter to reach Five Star Competitive Edge status. She was also the first chapter president to lead the chapter to Five Star status in the Five Star Chapter Plan, and she took the leadership class at MTC, which uses curriculum based on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Studies program. She was also named to the 2011 All-South Carolina Community College Academic Team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I tried to do everything I could,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It all adds up. These are things that will continue to be important in your life. These programs are there to help you, but you have to help yourself first and actually participate in them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald was also able to utilize CollegeFish.org, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s innovative website that helps students complete their associate degree and transfer to the four-year college of their choice. The site was founded in 2011, and Oswald was among its first users to reap its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s such an easy website to use,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;There are so many chances, so many opportunities to transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For me, just like a lot of other members, I got a lot out of it. I also put a lot into it. But the rewards were definitely greater than the time I put into it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Blalock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Support Officer who oversees CollegeFish.org, said stories like Oswald&amp;rsquo;s prove that students who do the research and take advantage of the opportunities afforded to them through Society programs and initiatives will yield big results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is where it all begins,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;With more than $37 million in transfer scholarships available for two-year college students through CollegeFish.org to more than 700 four-year schools, achieving an undergraduate degree is more accessible than ever before. You just have to put in the effort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald is now an active member of the Carolinas Region alumni chapter. She received Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s 2012 Alumni Award of Appreciation, and she continues to work with her former chapter through attending induction ceremonies and volunteering for C4 events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She has been the keynote speaker at several induction ceremonies since her graduation, where she focuses on the benefits of Phi Theta Kappa, specifically the scholarships as she challenges students to dream and work to achieve their dreams,&amp;rdquo; said Kitty Spires, advisor to the Alpha Eta Kappa Chapter. &amp;ldquo;She brings to completion the slogan that is located on all of our campuses &amp;mdash; &amp;lsquo;You can get anywhere from here.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sara embraces, and is the epitome of, the hallmarks of scholarships, leadership, service and fellowship. She continues to reach out to new members, as she understands the importance that Phi Theta Kappa has had in her life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswald is seeking a graduate degree in higher education so she can work with students on the two-year college level and help them find the opportunities to realize and fulfill their dreams. For her, chief among the ways to do that is to get involved with Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa exists to help people,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I have a sense of self-confidence that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have before. It&amp;rsquo;s been a totally transformative experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;People need to go ahead and really make a point to get involved. No one&amp;rsquo;s going to hand it to you. You have to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>  Khan Academy Announces Winners in Phi Theta Kappa Tutoring Challenge</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/Winners-of-Khan-Academy-Tutoring-Challenge-Announced 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-22T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, October 22, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six Phi Theta Kappa members have been named winners in the Khan Academy Tutoring Challenge. Khan Academy is a non-profit educational organization created in 2006 by educator Salman Khan to provide &amp;quot;a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Khan Academy Tutoring Challenge was announced at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s 2014 Honors Institute and closed on September 12. A total of 354 students were tutored by 203 members representing 139 chapters. Those tutored mastered nearly 21,000 skills. Winners were selected based on short videos and written descriptions submitted about their experiences as Khan Academy coaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winners of the challenge include&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elvira Avdeyeva - Tau Eta Chapter, Allen County Community College, Kansas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherri Dillon - Lambda Nu Chapter, Bronx Community College, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Immel &amp;ndash; Beta Mu Gamma Chapter, Solano Community College, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mina Jahan - Alpha Lambda Xi Chapter, Lone Star College-Kingwood, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ogulna Orazgeldiyeva - Iota Alpha Chapter, Trinity Valley Community College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Navarro - Beta Kappa Pi Chapter, Chaffey College, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honorable Mentions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brianna Ingemi, Alpha Chi Kappa Chapter, Nashua Community College, New Hampshire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Han Setiawan, Mu Tau Chapter, Lansing Community College, Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naomi Davidson, Manager of Education Partnerships for Higher Education at Khan Academy, said the winners received the opportunity to serve on an advisory council for Khan Academy, in addition to certificates and t-shirts. The council will help the organization think about best practices and help launch future initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davidson said the Khan Academy website provides videos, choice of languages and closed captioning that help break down barriers to learning, helping students to help themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Khan Academy&amp;rsquo;s mission is one that aligns with Phi Theta Kappa. Both of our organizations are passionate about student success,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;Since many of our members serve as tutors on their campuses, Khan Academy&amp;rsquo;s resources are a wonderful tool for helping students build their skills as tutors while also using the opportunity to brush up on subjects they need as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what some of the challenge winners had to say about the experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Khan Academy Tutoring Challenge was a lot of fun. I extended information of the tutoring service to all the incoming freshmen at my college,&amp;rdquo; said Sherri Dillon. &amp;ldquo;The hardest part was staying in contact with students, since it was summer break, but it was very helpful for me and those whom I have been able to reach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The College Tutor Challenge has been such a wonderful and at the same time challenging experience. I really enjoyed being a tutor and a coach for students who have problems with math,&amp;rdquo; said Elvira Avdeyeva. &amp;ldquo;I love math! I&amp;#39;ve always loved it. I know that the majority of students have difficulties with mathematics, so coaching students and guiding them through Khan Academy has been a big pleasure for me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Khan Academy should be the first stop in math learning endeavors. It is well structured with different exercises and videos by experts. Through Khan Academy Tutoring I have learned the importance of the digital world,&amp;rdquo; said Ogulnazik Orazgeldiyeva. &amp;ldquo;It is an amazing site where you can actually see your progress. Practicing various mathematical skills with my tutor helped me to succeed and go to the higher levels of math classes. It has encouraged my passion to do and learn more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It proved quite a trial to motivate my cousins and siblings on their summer break to hop on a computer and do some math challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s simply not appealing for a kid who has gotten used to the idea of turning off brain functions during summer vacations,&amp;rdquo; said Mina Jahan. &amp;ldquo;However, after a few weeks, my recruited family members got into the habit of doing Khan Academy themselves. They&amp;nbsp;began to see its advantages and appreciate its flexible and student-tailored approach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the competition is over, Phi Theta Kappa members are encouraged to explore the resources available through &lt;a href="http://https://www.khanacademy.org"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We encourage Phi Theta Kappa members to utilize Khan Academy for their studies &amp;ndash; explore, sign up as coaches and use Khan as a tool to be a better tutor,&amp;rdquo; Davidson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtney Taylor, Associate Director of Institutional Advancement for the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, said the Khan Academy tutoring tools are perfect for students who serve as peer tutors and will also help members maintain high GPAs and complete their degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re so appreciative for Khan Academy&amp;rsquo;s approach to completion &amp;ndash; providing tools to help students succeed,&amp;rdquo; Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. Nearly 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 131,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Advisor Institutes Build Confidence for New, Seasoned Advisors</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/advisor-institutes-build-confidence 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-17T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Friday, October 17, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisor since May 2014, Jaton Brame found herself needing an extra education on the ins and outs of the honor society. Enter the 2014 Advisor Institutes, and she now has a newfound confidence in her role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My excitement level has shifted for the better in serving as the chapter advisor,&amp;rdquo; said Brame, advisor to the Alpha Upsilon Omega Chapter at Ivy Tech Community College-Richmond in Indiana. &amp;ldquo;Because of this shift, my zeal to ensure that the students are best served will become more evident in what I do throughout the year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa held two Advisor Institutes this year: September 12-13 near Dallas, Texas, and September 19-20 near Cincinnati, Ohio. More than 160 advisors and three college presidents from 32 states attended the free conferences, where a team of Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters staff members shared with advisors the tools and knowledge to help them and their colleges reap the benefits of a fully engaged Phi Theta Kappa chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions focused on the role of a Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisor and featured breakout sessions on such topics as College Projects, Honors in Action, and member benefits. And an overall look at Phi Theta Kappa as a partner with advisors and their colleges to help all students accomplish their goals was shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We can all be so proud of our honor society&amp;rsquo;s proven record of student success in all its many forms, such as scholarships, college completion rates, career achievements and lifelong-dedicated scholar servant-leaders,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Success Officer. &amp;ldquo;A great deal of this success is because of the work and unfaltering support of our chapter advisors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advisor Institutes are advisor-only conferences aimed at educating, engaging and supporting the nearly 3,000 Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisors. The success of 2013&amp;rsquo;s inaugural Advisor Institute led to a second conference being added in 2014, and two Advisor Institutes are already being planned for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa covers registration, one night&amp;rsquo;s lodging and meals for all registered participants. The only cost to participate is transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s an invaluable networking resource for a new advisor to learn more about Phi Theta Kappa, their role as an advisor, how their chapter can attain Five Star status in year one and beyond, and much more,&amp;rdquo; Brame said. &amp;ldquo;I learned that Phi Theta Kappa is not a student organization, but an organization that focuses on student success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both new and seasoned advisors can learn from Advisor Institute. There is no formal training for advisors once they accept the role, and for many, it&amp;rsquo;s a role that was appointed to them by their college administration or that they inherited from a retiring advisor. For most advisors, it&amp;rsquo;s a learn-as-you-go experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even though I have been an advisor for three school years, I still feel very new at it,&amp;rdquo; said Lisa Maple, advisor to the Alpha Iota Epsilon Chapter at Lincoln Land College in Illinois. &amp;ldquo;This conference is vital for Phi Theta Kappa. I can&amp;rsquo;t even begin to explain how helpful it was, how organized and how much I benefited from attending.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning more about her role, Maple found her confidence increase through her attendance of the Advisor Institute. Not only did she learn skills and ideas she could use to become an even better advisor, but she also felt like she was doing a good job already. And, that she could let go a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My attendance has already benefited my chapter with regards to how I see my role and the role of the chapter officers by letting them take more leadership in decisions,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;This conference was one of the top three that I have attended in my entire life!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the sessions during the Advisor Institute in Dallas were filmed and will be shared online in the coming months. Dates for the 2015 Advisor Institutes will be announced soon. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>10 Tips for Writing Your Scholarship Resume</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/scholarships-resume-advice 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-16T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, October 16, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall scholarship season is officially upon us, and so is the potential for big awards for students preparing to complete a certificate or associate degree or planning to transfer to a four-year college or university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Phi Theta Kappa, approximately $520,000 is available now through December 1 on the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application,&lt;/a&gt; including the Hites Transfer, Guistwhite and GEICO Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree scholarships and the All-USA Community College Academic Team Scholarship. An additional $37 million in transfer scholarships is available on &lt;a href="http://www.collegefish.org"&gt;CollegeFish.org&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; many exclusively for Phi Theta Kappa members. And the &lt;a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/undergraduate-transfer/"&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; application is open now through December 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholarship applications are something nearly all students will face at one point or another in their college career, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to know the ins and outs of what makes an application successful. One key element is your scholarship resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For many scholarships, the application will be your only chance in front of the judges, so you have to make it count by making a good impression,&amp;rdquo; said Christin Grissom, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Scholarship Operations. &amp;ldquo;A scholarship resume is a great resource to help you clearly outline goals, engagement, education, awards earned and leadership experience often required on applications, and it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent way to organize your accomplishments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan Higher Education, a leading international provider of educational and career services for individuals, schools and businesses, shares these 10 tips for writing your scholarship resume.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep your scholarship resume relevant.&lt;/strong&gt; Your resume is meant to introduce you and your background to a scholarship committee that has never met you. Stress the things that are most positive about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Limit your resume to one page.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a font that is easy to read. The font size should be between 10 and 12; your headings may be larger. Ideally, margins should be one inch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Be specific and truthful.&lt;/strong&gt; Be complete, descriptive and specific without being too lengthy. Always be truthful and accurate without exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Accuracy is important. &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure your resume is organized and very neat. It should be free of any spelling or grammatical errors. Have an instructor, classmate or supervisor proofread and critique your resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Always use action words.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid passive or weak phrases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Omit all personal pronouns. &lt;/strong&gt;Examples include &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;we.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Be consistent.&lt;/strong&gt; Consistent punctuation, verb tense, dates and spacing gives your resume a neat and organized appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Use bullets to list your achievements. &lt;/strong&gt;Bullets help draw the reader&amp;rsquo;s eye down the page and convey that your resume is organized and concise. Begin each bullet with an action verb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Personal information is irrelevant.&lt;/strong&gt; This includes religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender, marital status and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Organize your resume. &lt;/strong&gt;You can organize your resume in many different ways, but the following order works well. Use it as a guide to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resume header: Type your name, address, phone number and email address at the top of your resume.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career goals: In a couple of sentences, discuss your career goals. Keep this section concise, but include enough detail to show your reader that you have a plan for your future.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work experience: Beginning with your current or most recent job, list your work experience. Include both part-time and full-time employment, if applicable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education: List your high school and any college courses you have completed and/or degrees conferred. Include your cumulative GPA only if it is 3.0 or above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honors and awards: List any honors and/or awards you have received.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honors courses: Mention any honors courses you have completed or if you are taking courses beyond the standard course load.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Courses attended: Record any seminars or training courses attended (e.g., Red Cross training).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Languages: List your language skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computer experience: List any and all experience you have with computers, using the actual names of the programs you are familiar with (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memberships: List any affiliations, memberships and/or associations you belong to, including any leadership roles. Include any school-sponsored clubs and/or honor societies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community involvement: List any volunteer work or community activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enrichment activities: List any enrichment programs, travel programs and/or hobbies that have expanded your educational experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Athletic achievements: Include any athletic achievements or memberships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visual and performing arts: List any achievements in the visual and performing arts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more scholarship resources, including a sample scholarship resume, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/scholarships/resources"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>2014 Dr. Mary Hood Texas Region Scholar Receives a $1,500 Scholarship </title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/2014-Hood-Scholar-Named 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-13T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Monday, October 13, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, MS &amp;ndash; Timothy West, a student at Weatherford College, has been selected by Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society to receive a $1,500 scholarship as the 2014 Dr. Mary Hood Texas Region Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/timothy%20westweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/timothy%20westweb.jpg?itok=VPcGeIL6" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy West&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his high school graduation, West took a short break from academics to enter the workforce but quickly realized the importance of a college degree. A chemical engineering major, he earned a 4.0 at Weatherford College and became a member of Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West hopes to transfer to the University of Texas, attend law school and pursue a career as a public servant dealing with energy and natural resource issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Hood served as Texas Regional Coordinator for 18 years and was a member of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors at the time of her death in 2011. The Dr. Mary Hood Texas Region Scholarship was established in her memory, providing scholarships to Phi Theta Kappa members in Texas who are still attending community college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dr. Mary Hood Texas Region Scholarship is presented to the Texas applicant with the highest score from Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s spring common scholarship application, where recipients are chosen for multiple programs from more than 800 applicants worldwide to receive in excess of $230,000 in scholarships. Independent judges evaluate the applications based on scholastic achievement, community service and leadership potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley said Dr. Mary Hood was a pioneer in promoting college completion, long before this initiative captured the attention of the higher education community, and that it was fitting to remember her by giving a scholarship that honors leadership and helps students complete an associate degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mary was one of the leaders who helped shape the Phi Theta Kappa of today,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Together, she and Phi Theta Kappa changed the lives of thousands of students, and her legacy will live on as lives are changed with this scholarship presented in her memory.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. Nearly 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 131,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-09T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, October 9, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the second &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/news/collegefish-completion-transfer-month"&gt;Community College Completion and Transfer Month&lt;/a&gt; gets underway, we&amp;rsquo;re going to start with the basics: setting up your &lt;a href="http://collegefish.org/"&gt;CollegeFish.org&lt;/a&gt; profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Get-Hooked-Logo.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Get-Hooked-Logo.jpg?itok=16ZDydf6" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share your Community College Completion &amp;amp; Transfer Month events on the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/collegefish"&gt;CollegeFish.org Facebook page.&lt;/a&gt; #hookedoncompletion #fishfanatics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is where it all begins,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Blalock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Support Officer who oversees CollegeFish.org. &amp;ldquo;Creating a CollegeFish.org account will help you search, select, secure and succeed in completing your associate degree or two-year college certificate, transferring to the four-year college of your choice and competing for scholarships.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need an extra incentive to create your profile? All throughout October, when you create a CollegeFish.org profile, you&amp;rsquo;ll be eligible to &lt;strong&gt;win a $1,000 scholarship!&lt;/strong&gt; One lucky winner will be announced in early November. You can also get qualified by logging into your &lt;a href="http://collegefish.org/"&gt;CollegeFish.org account&lt;/a&gt; anytime in October; by liking the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/collegefish"&gt;CollegeFish.org Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and posting your name, college and email address; and by attending a webinar and providing your name, college and email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do all of these activities and attend multiple webinars to increase your chances of winning. &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/news/collegefish-completion-transfer-month"&gt;Find a full schedule of webinars.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up your CollegeFish.org profile is free and easy. There are several steps, but each one brings you closer to more than $37 million in transfer scholarships that are available &amp;mdash; many exclusively to Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://www.collegefish.org/"&gt;CollegeFish.org&lt;/a&gt; and click on &amp;ldquo;Log in&amp;rdquo; in the upper right-hand corner of the page. The next page is a login page similar to Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s sign-in page at ptk.org. If you have never logged in to CollegeFish.org, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to click &amp;ldquo;Create Account&amp;rdquo; next to the green Login button. One thing to note: if you&amp;#39;re a Phi Theta Kappa member, your CollegeFish.org login credentials should be the same as your credentials for ptk.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to fill in your name and email address and choose a password. Entering your birth date is optional. Important: your password must be at least eight characters and include only numbers and letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will then receive an email with a validation code from donotreply@ptk.org. If it&amp;rsquo;s not in your inbox, be sure to check your junk or trash folders. Open the email and click on the hyperlink, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be taken directly to the next step. As a Phi Theta Kappa member, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to connect your CollegeFish.org and ptk.org accounts by choosing &amp;ldquo;Link Phi Theta Kappa member id.&amp;rdquo; If you&amp;rsquo;re not a Phi Theta Kappa member &amp;mdash; CollegeFish.org is open to all two-year college students &amp;mdash; simply choose &amp;ldquo;Done.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to verify your access. There are three options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a Phi Theta Kappa member and a student at a 2-year school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am a student at a two-year school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not a student at a two-year school.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the category that fits, then click on the green arrow in the lower right-hand corner to navigate through the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve validated your name and input your community college and date of birth, a welcome screen will appear. Click on &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started&amp;rdquo; to complete your personalized profile and receive both college and scholarship matches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll then go through a series of questions &amp;mdash; each one will help CollegeFish.org find the best-fit options for your future. Once you have answered all of the questions and completed the profile, you&amp;rsquo;ll receive both scholarship recommendations and college matches. Then, simply click on them to learn more and start your search!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you can save your top-choice scholarships and colleges in your moneybag and fishbowl, respectively. You can add important dates to your calendar, create goals, monitor your progress through your personalized plan and much more. To learn more about everything CollegeFish.org has to offer, make plans to attend one of these informative webinars:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oct. 14, 1 &amp;amp; 7 pm CST, CollegeFish.org Search &amp;amp; Select 101&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oct. 15, 1 &amp;amp; 7 pm CST, CollegeFish.org Scholarship Resume &amp;amp; Essay 101&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oct. 21, 1 &amp;amp; 7 pm CST, Creating a Successful CollegeFish.org Campus-Wide Rollout, hosted by the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter at Bluegrass Community and Technical College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oct. 22, 1 &amp;amp; 7 pm CST, FishFinance: College Savings 101, hosted by the Omicron Beta Chapter at Mesa Community College&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Now he is well on his way to achieving those goals as one of two 2014 recipients of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s $1,000 GEICO Pathway to Completion Associate Degree Scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/brandon%20hayes%207492%20%282%29.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/brandon%20hayes%207492%20%282%29.jpg?itok=9wvRNGiE" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandon Hayes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/emilie%20st-pierre.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/emilie%20st-pierre.jpg?itok=jHkCnHrv" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilie St. Pierre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employed with Chick-Fil-A since he was 14, Hayes entered their leadership internship program in his first year of employment and was the youngest employee to fulfill a management leadership position in his area. He graduated from high school as a Tennessee Scholar with highest honors, volunteered 150 hours at a local hospital, and entered Walters State Community College, where he maintains a 4.0 grade point average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes holds leadership positions with the college&amp;rsquo;s Student Government Association and his Phi Theta Kappa chapter, and he serves as a Senate Page. He hopes to transfer to East Tennessee State University to double major in accounting and finance and pursue master&amp;#39;s and doctoral degrees in economics and business at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville. Hayes hopes to own and operate a Chick-Fil-A franchise, mentor high school and college students and give back to the community by developing a college scholarship program to help other children of single parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second 2014 GEICO Scholar is Emilie St. Pierre. Taking her first programming class at the College of Southern Nevada challenged her and cultivated an interest in networking forensics. While maintaining a 3.91 grade point average, St. Pierre serves as Math Club President and as a PC and server repair technician within her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of Phi Theta Kappa, she is pursuing an Associate of Arts degree in Network Security and Computer Forensics. St. Pierre plans to pursue a career in cybersecurity, helping organizations investigate their data structure and past breaches to implement strategies to avoid future work disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GEICO Pathway to Completion Associate Degree Scholarships are presented by GEICO to Phi Theta Kappa members pursuing associate degrees. A sponsor of the Phi Theta Kappa Annual Convention, GEICO has given more than $1 million to support scholarships and programs for Phi Theta Kappa members. GEICO also provides additional scholarships to Phi Theta Kappa members for the completion of baccalaureate and master&amp;rsquo;s degrees and for the professional development for chapter advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scholarships of $1,000 each are given to Phi Theta Kappa members who have held a significant leadership position on campus or in their community, with preference given to those who have held chapter, regional or international office. Phi Theta Kappa provides more than 900 applicants worldwide in excess of $230,000 in scholarships to complete associate level studies each fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GEICO is a member of the Berkshire Hathaway family of companies and is the third-largest private passenger auto insurance company in the United States, serving more than 12 million private passenger customers and insuring more than 18 million vehicles (auto and cycle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. Nearly 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 131,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Best Practices: Make Your Fall Scholarship Application Stand Out</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/fall-scholarship-app-tips 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-06T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Monday, October 6, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Phi Theta Kappa members apply for scholarships using the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application&lt;/a&gt; each year. So how do you make sure your application stands out from the rest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christin Grissom, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Scholarship Operations, shares these tips that will help your scholarship application be one the judges will remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply EARLY! &amp;bull; Give yourself time to create an exceptional scholarship entry. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;bull; Don&amp;rsquo;t wait until the last minute to apply. Deadlines can make or break you. &amp;bull; Transcripts and Student Assessments take time to obtain. &amp;bull; Online applications can&amp;rsquo;t be completed two hours ahead of the deadline; give yourself time in case you run into technological or login problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a scholarship RESUME before beginning the application. &lt;/strong&gt;Outlining engagement and hours of service in the following areas can help prevent important omissions. As you build experience in these areas, update your scholarship resume to quickly access necessary information to complete future scholarship applications. Your resume should include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Campus Involvement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community Service&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scholarships and Awards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work Experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the PURPOSE of the Scholarship. &lt;/strong&gt;Understanding the purpose of the scholarship helps you to both customize and strengthen your scholarship entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish solid STUDENT ASSESSMENTS.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; Choose a recommender who knows you well and can elaborate on specific and pertinent information outlined within in your application. &amp;bull; Explain the criteria of the award &amp;mdash; send a copy of your application to them. &amp;bull; Give recommenders ample time to complete the Student Assessment. &amp;bull; Send thank-you letters afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When writing your ESSAY:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stick to the topic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use vivid details, share numbers or facts and address the impact of your engagement to make your application stand out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD, PROOFREAD! Have others proofread your essay to provide feedback and use this to revise your entry.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your application should be NEAT and FLAWLESS.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;bull; It can be difficult to identify misspellings, grammatical or punctuation mistakes when completing online applications. Compose responses in a separate document to help you identify errors before transferring them to your application. &amp;bull; Never submit your first draft. &amp;bull; Organize information with bullets. &amp;bull; This is your one chance in front of the judges &amp;mdash; make a good impression!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have MULTIPLE people CRITIQUE your application. &lt;/strong&gt;Ensuring your application is cohesive and flawless from start to finish strengthens your entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-check your application for COMPLETION. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;An incomplete application is as good as NO application. All components of the application, including transcripts and Student Assessments, must be submitted by the deadline for your application to be considered complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRINT your application before submission. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;bull; You can use it as a reference for future scholarship entries. &amp;bull; If it gets lost, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above all, do not miss the deadline! Applications are due December 1, 2014!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read more about the scholarships offered on the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Jack Kent Cooke Scholarship App Opens Oct. 6; Amount Increased</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/jack-kent-cooke-app-opening 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-03T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Friday, October 3, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications for the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/undergraduate-transfer/"&gt;2015 Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the largest undergraduate scholarship in the nation &amp;mdash; will be accepted beginning October 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 85 of the nation&amp;rsquo;s top two-year college students will be selected to receive $40,000 each per year for up to three years to complete a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree at an accredited college or university in the United States. The Foundation recently increased the amount awarded from $30,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We believe it is important for our Scholars to graduate from college as close to debt free as possible so that they can maximize the career and graduate school opportunities that await them,&amp;rdquo; said Emily Froimson, Vice President of Programs at the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deadline to apply for the scholarship is December 2.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;a href="http://info.jkcf.org/jkcf15-0-0-0"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt; for the 2015 Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship will be held October 9 at 4 pm ET. Learn more about the &lt;a href="http://www.jkcf.org/"&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, 71 of the 85 undergraduate transfer scholarship recipients were Phi Theta Kappa members. Among them was Lori King-Nelson, who along with her family had been struggling financially since she began attending classes as a non-traditional student at Tarrant County College&amp;rsquo;s South Campus in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To know things are going to be okay over the next few years while I finish my degree is pretty overwhelming,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the $120,000 award each student stands to receive, the Foundation offers up to $50,000 each to scholars upon the completion of their baccalaureate degree if they meet renewal criteria and continue enrollment for a master&amp;rsquo;s degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I always wanted to go as high as I could go in my education; but until recently, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a reality,&amp;rdquo; said Dennis Murphy, a 2014 Jack Kent Cooke Scholar from Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts and a Phi Theta Kappa chapter officer. &amp;ldquo;This award gives me the opportunity to achieve the education I need to reach my dreams. It&amp;rsquo;s opening doors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, only about 12 percent of two-year college students who express interest in earning a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree actually reach that goal. Many students are deterred by the high price of four-year colleges, the limited options for transfer students and a lack of knowledge about the possible academic pathways, the foundation has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is why partnerships providing varied sources of stackable scholarships matter,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley. &amp;ldquo;While we are extremely grateful for the commitment the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation has made to our two-year college students, more foundations and organizations must invest in our nation&amp;rsquo;s students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not only an investment that will benefit the students; it&amp;rsquo;s an investment that will benefit us all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Scholars are selected based on high academic ability and achievements, persistence, leadership and financial need. The average GPA of the 2014 Scholars is 3.98, and they come from families with an average adjusted gross income of approximately $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation has long been committed to helping outstanding community college students transfer to and succeed at the nation&amp;rsquo;s top colleges and universities,&amp;rdquo; Froimson said. &amp;ldquo;Since the program started in 2002, the Foundation has supported 643 community college students directly, and thousands more through the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s grant-making initiatives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past Undergraduate Transfer Scholars have attended such prestigious colleges as Amherst College, Columbia University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Stanford University, Wellesley College and Yale University. Among the 2013 Scholars, 62 percent were first-generation college students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although Phi Theta Kappa membership is not required for this award, Society members often make up a large percentage of the recipients each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Students who engage in Phi Theta Kappa programs gain immeasurably from the experience and are recognized for their achievements by prestigious scholarship providers like the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Consistently, the majority of scholarship recipients are engaged Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We value the strong working relationship that Phi Theta Kappa has for many years shared with the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation in providing our members access to selective senior colleges.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-02T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, October 2, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know its mascot, and you know its tagline. But did you know that GEICO has given more than $1 million to support scholarships and programs for Phi Theta Kappa members?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/ChrisLemaster.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/ChrisLemaster.jpg?itok=9cTkMUh2" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris LeMaster and the GEICO Gecko at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s 2013 Annual Convention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie Goldszmidt does; she is a recipient of the 2014 GEICO Pathways to Completion Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree Scholarship, which awards $1,500 each to the two top-scoring applicants for Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Guistwhite Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/angie%20goldszmidtweb_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/angie%20goldszmidtweb_0.jpg?itok=TDGp7BcX" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014 GEICO Pathways to Completion Bachelor&amp;#39;s Degree Scholarship recipient Angie Goldszmidt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, Goldszmidt was living with her family in underground shelters in Northern Israel, taking cover from Hezbollah rocket attacks. She immigrated to the United States at the age of 14. After high school, she worked 40 hours a week at a wholesale diamond company each day and as a waitress on weekends while earning a 4.0 GPA as a student at Bergen Community College in New Jersey at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldszmidt served as secretary for the Model United Nations Club and as president of her Phi Theta Kappa chapter. She hopes to earn advanced degrees in political science and become an advocate of positive change on the national and international levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Many of our students come from low-income families and broken homes, and some live in homeless shelters,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I feel it is my personal duty to do everything I can to help them graduate and support them through the transfer process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership between GEICO and Phi Theta Kappa has proven valuable for both organizations. In addition to serving as an Annual Convention sponsor, GEICO also provides a &lt;a href="https://www.geico.com/landingpage/member-discount/?logo=17848"&gt;discount on car insurance&lt;/a&gt; to Phi Theta Kappa members and advisors. Plus, a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GEICOCareers"&gt;GEICO Career Fair&lt;/a&gt; will be hosted later in the year exclusively for Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We value education and actively promote it within our company too,&amp;rdquo; said Deedre Daniel, GEICO&amp;rsquo;s Director, National Sales and Service: Partnership, Affinity and Membership Discounts. &amp;ldquo;It is our hope that these students go on to finish their bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degrees and find rewarding careers when they graduate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GEICO Pathways to Completion Scholarship Program provides a total of $10,000 in scholarships to Phi Theta Kappa members: two awards of $1,000 at the associate level; two awards of $1,500 at the baccalaureate level; and two awards of $2,500 at the graduate level. Applications for the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships/geico-masters"&gt;GEICO Pathway to Completion Master&amp;rsquo;s Degree Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; are now being accepted through October 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;GEICO is an ideal partner, and it is fitting that their innovation would fund our first graduate-level scholarship,&amp;rdquo; said Courtney Taylor, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Associate Director of Institutional Advancement. &amp;ldquo;We are thankful that they consistently go above and beyond for our members through discounts, jobs and now this scholarship program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program also funds the Marshall and Mosal Leadership Awards, two awards of $5,000 each for advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;GEICO is committed to supporting Phi Theta Kappans as they pursue their education, career and lifetime goals,&amp;rdquo; said Chris LeMaster, GEICO&amp;rsquo;s Service and Event Manager: Partnership, Affinity and Membership Discounts. &amp;ldquo;We understand that for some individuals their goals may include getting an advanced degree. It is our hope that the scholarships will help alleviate some of the financial burden placed on them and allow the recipients to focus on their goals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeMaster visits with Phi Theta Kappa members and advisors regularly when he attends Nerd Nation, the Society&amp;#39;s Annual Convention. The excitement and gratitude they express for the GEICO partnership moves him every time, and he knows it&amp;rsquo;s a partnership neither organization will end anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa is one of the most passionate, energetic and driven groups that I work with,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;From the staff to the members, you would be hard-pressed to find a group that lives and breathes the mission and goals of an organization as much as Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are so fortunate to work with such a great honor society and look forward to many more years of supporting Phi Theta Kappa members and saving them money.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-10-01T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, October 1, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application&lt;/a&gt; opens October 1, and brings with it access to approximately $520,000 for students preparing to complete a certificate or associate degree or planning to transfer to a four-year college or university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some significant changes have been made to the application in an effort to both streamline the application process and to make the application itself more user-friendly. These changes affect students, college nominators and those asked to submit student assessments (formerly letters of recommendation). The application deadline is December 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With nearly $1 million up for grabs through our fall and spring scholarship applications, we want to ensure that as many eligible students apply as possible,&amp;rdquo; said Christin Grissom, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Scholarship Operations. &amp;ldquo;The ease and convenience of our scholarship application is one of the largest determinants of the number of students that will apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve heard the feedback, and we&amp;rsquo;ve made the changes that will hopefully encourage even more students to apply for these incredible scholarship awards.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, students will now self-identify with a college to access the application. In the past, students had to receive a special code from the college&amp;rsquo;s designated scholarship nominator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students will also notice fewer uploads during the application process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uploads have been tremendous barriers to students completing our application,&amp;rdquo; Grissom said. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve cut down on front-end uploads and will be requiring minimal uploads on the back end before we select winners.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of letters of recommendation, recommenders will be asked to complete a student assessment &amp;mdash; a questionnaire assessment within the application. This change will both increase the quality of responses and reduce upload barriers for recommenders as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We hope these changes will benefit the application process for students, advisors and nominators alike,&amp;rdquo; Grissom said. &amp;ldquo;Our two-year college students are among the hardest working students out there, and they deserve as much financial help as they can get to encourage them to continue their education.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following scholarships are administered on the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Fall Scholarship Application:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hites Transfer Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be a Phi Theta Kappa member&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 scholarships of $7,500 each, for a total of $75,000 awarded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guistwhite Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be a Phi Theta Kappa member&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15 scholarships of $5,000 each, for a total of $75,000 awarded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;GEICO Pathway to Completion Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be a Phi Theta Kappa member&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must apply for the Guistwhite Scholarship&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 scholarships of $1,500 each, for a total of $3,000 awarded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-USA Community College Academic Team Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open to non-members; must be nominated by your college&amp;rsquo;s designated nominator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20 scholarships of $2,500 each, for a total of $50,000 awarded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Community College Academic Team Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open to non-members; must be nominated by your college&amp;rsquo;s designated nominator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50 Gold Scholar Awards of $1,500; 50 Silver Scholar Awards of $1,250; and 50 Bronze Scholar Awards of $1,000, for a total of $187,500 awarded&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola New Century Scholars Scholarship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open to non-members; must be nominated by your college&amp;rsquo;s designated nominator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awarded to the top-scoring student from each of the 50 United States, Canada or other sovereign nation where at least one Phi Theta Kappa chapter resides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;52 scholarships of $2,000, for a total of $104,000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-State Community College Academic Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must be nominated by your college&amp;rsquo;s designated nominator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Must reside in one of the 38 participating states&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than $41 million available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Best Practices: Creating an Induction Celebration</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/razzle-dazzle-induction 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-09-26T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Friday, September 26, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some chapters, the induction ceremony is the only Phi Theta Kappa-related event that many of its members will ever attend. If this is your only chance to interact with such members, how can you communicate the myriad benefits of membership and encourage involvement while still keeping the honor that comes with the induction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/most%20distinguished%20chapter%20ky.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/most%20distinguished%20chapter%20ky.jpg?itok=AASTBIrO" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter at Bluegrass Community &amp;amp; Technical College in Lexington, Kentucky, has the answer &amp;mdash; and it involves a lot of &amp;ldquo;Razzle and Dazzle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Basically, we incorporated joy and excitement into every single element of our program,&amp;rdquo; advisor Cindy Baker said. &amp;ldquo;I know it sounds so simple, but it made all the difference in the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter&amp;rsquo;s first Razzle Dazzle Induction took place in spring 2014. The goal of the reimagined induction ceremony was to engage the new members&amp;rsquo; families &amp;mdash; especially their parents &amp;mdash; in chapter development and opportunities so they would encourage their children to be active members. To accomplish this, the chapter created an atmosphere more conducive to fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location was the first thing to change. Rather than holding the ceremony in an auditorium followed by a small standing reception in the lobby, the chapter reserved a large conference room and arranged tables throughout. This allowed new members to sit with their families during the ceremony, and it encouraged them to stay for the reception because they could actually sit and enjoy the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as new members lingered in the reception, there was more time for chapter officers and other members to reach out to them about Society initiatives and programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The point is to engage more active members,&amp;rdquo; Baker said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s more of a celebration, and it worked. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we didn&amp;rsquo;t think of it before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tables were topped with balloons and other colorful decorations to encourage the celebratory atmosphere. Music by the Beach Boys filled the room and helped attendees shake the unseasonably cold weather outside. Families were given pompoms to use to cheer on their students as they were called up for induction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine action tables were set up around the venue focusing on programs like Honors in Action, CollegeFish.org and Scholarships; fundraisers for the chapter; and regional and international conferences. Attendees were given a road map to guide them easily from one table to the next. This gave new members and their families an easy look at the various programs and opportunities available. A drawing was held at each table for a prize donated from a local business, which helped draw interest to the tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current chapter members were stationed at each table. They welcomed the inductees and their families, and offered them &amp;ldquo;Fellowship Snacks&amp;rdquo; like hot chocolate. Having chapter members participate in such active ways encouraged them to interact with the new members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even chapter leaders can be hesitant to interact with people they&amp;rsquo;ve never met,&amp;rdquo; Baker said. &amp;ldquo;This was organized to give them something to talk about.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video showing the chapter in action and outlining awards it has won opened the ceremony. Guest speakers kept their presentations short and peppy &amp;mdash; the overall tone was representative of a &amp;ldquo;pep rally for the smart kids,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being invited into Phi Theta Kappa is such a happy moment for a student,&amp;rdquo; Baker said. &amp;ldquo;Our chapter had no hesitation at all in making this change. We were all very excited.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kentucky Regional Coordinator Margo Hamm said the induction ceremony was the best one she&amp;rsquo;s ever attended. She was so impressed that she asked the chapter to share planning tips at the regional convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Moving from a more serious approach to a fun celebration seemed to appeal to the new members and engaged both the students and their guests in the ceremony,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Phi Kappa Chapter will be holding its second Razzle Dazzle Induction in October, themed &amp;ldquo;Under the Big Top.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planning an induction ceremony? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/pam/induction-ceremony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find tools and resources here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Ready, Set, Goal!</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/ready-set-goal 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-09-25T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, September 25, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No goal? No problem! Chapters can set and update their Five Star Chapter Goals at any time throughout the calendar year. Even this late in the game, your chapter can still set and reach a goal. So let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;Five Star Chapter Plan&lt;/a&gt; is that many of the activities in which a chapter regularly participates &amp;mdash; like organizing a membership drive, holding twice-monthly meetings and reporting new chapter officers to Headquarters &amp;mdash; count toward your progress. Even the act of setting a Five Star goal helps you fulfill part of the plan. It&amp;rsquo;s that easy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the same way that classroom instructors provide students with a syllabus at the beginning of each semester, Phi Theta Kappa provides chapters with the Five Star Chapter Plan, which serves as a blueprint for success,&amp;rdquo; said Courtney Lange, Phi Theta Kappa Director of Regional and Chapter Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lange explained that the Five Star Chapter Plan not only serves as a foundation for chapter success, but it also contributes directly to student success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that students who are engaged and active on their campus are more likely to succeed and complete their course of study,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 the Center for Community College Student Engagement (CCCSE) outlined five Benchmarks for Effective Educational Practice proven to be powerful contributors to effective teaching, learning and student retention: active and collaborative learning, student effort, academic challenge, student-faculty interaction and support for learners. The Five Star Chapter Plan meets all five benchmarks, often in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The plan promotes involvement on campus and in the community through recruitment, the College Project and the Honors in Action Project, which includes writing and research. &lt;em&gt;CCCSE Benchmarks: Active and Collaborative Learning, Academic Challenge, Student-Faculty Interaction and Student Effort&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The plan encourages engagement with other chapters through attendance of Regional and International Conventions. &lt;em&gt;CCCSE Benchmarks: Student-Faculty Interaction, Student Effort, Support for Learners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participation in the plan encourages excellence, recognizes attained goals set by the chapter and enhances the chapter&amp;rsquo;s working relationship with the college administration. &lt;em&gt;CCCSE Benchmarks: Active and Collaborative Learning, Student-Faculty Interaction, Student Effort, Support for Learners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Five Star Plan does more than award chapters for involvement and engagement,&amp;rdquo; Lange said. &amp;ldquo;It actually creates stronger members, which results in stronger chapters and more robust college campuses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Phi Theta Kappa considers your chapter to be active, then chances are good that you&amp;rsquo;ve already completed the One Star Level. There are only three requirements: organize a membership recruitment campaign, submit the Chapter Annual Report to Headquarters, and have your chapter&amp;rsquo;s bylaws approved by and on file with Headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know our chapters are doing wonderful things. Now, we want to make sure they get credit for them,&amp;rdquo; Lange said. &amp;ldquo;Set your chapter&amp;rsquo;s Five Star goal, and tell us about the great things that are happening in the life of your local chapter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must fulfill all requirements in a level to consider it completed. Likewise, just as each level builds on the one before it, you must fulfill all requirements for the highest level reached and all levels before it to receive recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you can work on multiple Five Star levels at the same time. Requirements for each level are detailed in the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/resources/chapter-leaders-guide"&gt;Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar/requirements"&gt;ptk.org/fivestar/requirements.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deadline to submit Five Star Chapter Plan updates for 2014 activities is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;January 28, 2015.&lt;/strong&gt; Find a list of Five Star FAQ&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar/faq"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; And then the plan begins again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every chapter begins anew every calendar year, allowing chapters to have a fresh start and a challenging goal year after year,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;Participation at every level of the Five Star Plan is critical to fulfilling our mission, which is why we encourage all chapters to participate at the level that fits them best each year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Member Recruitment Best Practices</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/member-recruitment-best-practices 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-09-24T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, September 24, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas Regional Coordinator and chapter advisor Tammy Fuentez has one piece of advice for chapters who want to increase their chapter&amp;rsquo;s on-campus visibility &amp;mdash; don&amp;rsquo;t be shy about Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/TauTheta_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/TauTheta_0.jpg?itok=Asywqjv4" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Tau Theta Chapter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuentez, who serves as Tau Theta chapter advisor at Labette Community College, set out on a mission with her chapter officer team. Their goal? To show others what Phi Theta Kappa has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/0_IMG_6448_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/0_IMG_6448_0.jpg?itok=BQNFsD8U" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Romeu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We do a good job of telling the story of Phi Theta Kappa, but not necessarily in showing others what Phi Theta Kappa has to offer,&amp;rdquo; Fuentez explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Fuentez and her team set out to spread the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau Theta found visibility through its multiple collection drives on campus. Pop tabs for the Ronald McDonald House; loose change for St. Jude&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital and Million Meals Kansas; old cell phones and ink cartridges for Holden&amp;rsquo;s Hope; all of these activities gave prospective members a good look at the fun and fellowship of the chapter. It also helped them put faces with their campus&amp;rsquo; Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If members see chapter officers having fun while being servant leaders and gaining scholarships, they are more likely to participate in activities,&amp;rdquo; Fuentez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter leaders also provided weekly email communication to members, informing them of upcoming activities and opportunities for participation. The result was a huge increase in participation and a 32 percent increase in membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the Beta Pi Theta Chapter at Miami Dade College-Hialeah Campus turned to a grassroots campaign of good old-fashioned word of mouth to increase its membership. In 2012, the chapter had only four active members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The then-incoming chapter president Jeffrey Romeu and new chapter advisor Dr. Kelly Kennedy needed a plan to overcome their biggest hurdle &amp;mdash; the small size of the Hialeah campus meant only one main academic building and a smaller pool of eligible members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We put posters on every floor of the buildings on campus,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said. &amp;ldquo;We set up a Facebook page. We had faculty members promote the benefits of Phi Theta Kappa membership in their classrooms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter also garnered about 800 signatures during a &lt;a href="http://www.cccompletioncorps.org/"&gt;C4 event,&lt;/a&gt; lending further visibility to the chapter. The chapter also promoted Phi Theta Kappa programming by displaying the results of its &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/honors-in-action"&gt;Honors in Action Project&lt;/a&gt; in the campus library, which also generated buzz and interest, Dr. Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beta Pi Theta Chapter also partnered with college administrators to send out an email invite to all eligible members. A follow-up email and passcode were sent, allowing students to accept membership online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding payment via credit card was important to the chapter, whose college campus is located in a low-income area. Many eligible students have been unable to pay the fees otherwise. Adding &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/docs/chapter/online_membership_flier.pdf"&gt;online acceptance&lt;/a&gt; was also a boon to the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Allowing students to accept membership online and pay by credit cards has been the best thing we&amp;rsquo;ve done related to making membership more accessible to our students,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were small steps, but they resulted in approximately 160 new members in about a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An increasing number of students operate in an online environment, spending less and less time on campus,&amp;rdquo; said Courtney Lange, Director of Regional and Chapter Development. &amp;ldquo;These are our students. In fact, 45 percent of students who accept membership online do so between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. We think that is significant.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online students represent untapped potential for many chapters. A 2013 study by Babson Survey Research Group found that the percentage of college students taking at least one online course has more than tripled over the past decade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holding his first induction ceremony as advisor for Darton State College&amp;rsquo;s Chi Xi Chapter, Frank Malinowski met a new member who was interested in a leadership office. But, he was an online student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I just created a position for him &amp;mdash; Vice President of Online,&amp;rdquo; Malinowski said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa was completely new to me, so I was just learning as I went. We wanted to test the waters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinowski, who also serves as Georgia Regional Coordinator, estimates that about a third of the students at Darton State College are online only. And, he said about another third take at least one online class. He believes that engaging these students in addition to the on-campus ones is critical to the success of his chapter as well as to student success on his campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;(Online students) can&amp;rsquo;t participate in everything we do, but they can participate in most things that we do,&amp;rdquo; Malinowski said. &amp;ldquo;With things like our Honors in Action and College Projects, online students have just as much of an ability and desire to participate. It&amp;rsquo;s really a matter of being flexible and letting them know they can be involved&amp;mdash;especially if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to leverage technology.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chi Xi Chapter streams its regular chapter meetings online to help increase member awareness and participation. A meeting moderator runs a live chat with online members so they can ask questions and make comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinowski said engaging online students &amp;ldquo;completely changes&amp;rdquo; the college experience they&amp;rsquo;re having. It also helps them gain visibility with faculty, staff and administrators, putting online students in the running for awards and scholarships that they may not have had access to otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each week will have a themed focus and will feature a variety of webinars related to college transfer and completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;CollegeFish.org offers all community college students the opportunity to begin planning for the completion of their two-year degree and preparing to successfully and seamlessly transfer to the four-year program of their choice, with academic and financial resources in place,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Blalock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Support Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa introduced CollegeFish.org in 2007. In 2012 the Society received a $2.9 million grant from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to enhance the website. It is now available to all two-year college students for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When students invest time and energy into exploring the transfer scholarships and opportunities in CollegeFish.org, there is great potential for reward,&amp;rdquo; Blalock said. &amp;ldquo;Through Community College Completion and Transfer Month, our goal is to make sure all two-year college students know the tools that are available to them through CollegeFish.org so they can receive the greatest reward possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One highlight this month is Ike CollegeFish&amp;rsquo;s birthday party on October 23. Webinars will be held live from Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters at 1 and 7 pm CST and will feature Society VIP&amp;rsquo;s detailing the impact and goals of Collegefish.org both now and for the future.

     <title>Developing Leaders, Student Success </title>

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-09-18T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, September 18, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite serving in both local and regional leadership positions in Phi Theta Kappa, Janet Walker considers herself a wallflower. Still, she joined Cohort 15 of the Leadership Development Study Group on Facebook and was one of 11 to complete the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was able to observe the discussion of how other members and students view and understand what leadership is all about,&amp;rdquo; said Walker, who is the interim president of the Beta Beta Tau Chapter at Atlanta Metropolitan State College in Georgia. She&amp;rsquo;s also the former chapter co-president and the former Georgia Regional Chapter Relations Representative. &amp;ldquo;I enjoyed reading everyone&amp;rsquo;s responses to the discussions and how we each interpreted those discussions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/leadership-development"&gt;Leadership Development Studies&lt;/a&gt; program is grounded in the humanities and offers a diverse, interdisciplinary approach to leadership instruction. The curriculum is accessible and relevant to all, regardless of whether a leadership position is held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of a personal philosophy of leadership is only one example of how participation in Phi Theta Kappa programs can contribute to student success. Even if a member is not currently serving in a position of leadership, the skills gained through the program will be highly sought after by a future employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two separate surveys &amp;mdash; the National Association of Colleges and Employers Job Outlook 2012 survey and the Center for Creative Leadership 2012 Leadership Insights survey &amp;mdash; found that the qualities employers most look for in recent college graduates are leadership skills:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;79.8 percent of employers look for the ability to work in a team on a candidate&amp;rsquo;s resume;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;77.2 percent want to see leadership skills;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;95 percent of employers believe leadership development should begin by age 21;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;90 percent believe leadership development opportunities should be part of every student&amp;rsquo;s educational experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a lot in the scholarly literature about leadership that focuses on the exercise of leadership regardless of position or authority,&amp;rdquo; said Monika Byrd, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Leadership Development and Service Learning. &amp;ldquo;Our Honors in Action Hallmark Award rubric, for example, is worded to encourage a broad and emergent, collaborative interpretation of the concept of &amp;lsquo;leadership.&amp;rsquo; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Studies program was recognized by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as one of only eight Exemplary Leadership Development Programs in Higher Education. Selection was based upon effectiveness, philosophy, sustainability, comprehensiveness and targeted training, development and support for program facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Throughout the course you learn about leadership skills that give you an understanding of what it is to work with a team,&amp;rdquo; said Elvira Avdeyeva, a member of the Tau Eta Chapter at Allen County Community College in Kansas and the Vice President of the Southern District in the Kansas Region. &amp;ldquo;This course will also enlighten you in areas such as decision making, team-building and servant leadership.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohorts of the Leadership Development Studies Study Group on Facebook run throughout the year for roughly eight weeks at a time, and discussions explore the readings found in all 11 units of &lt;em&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Leadership Development Studies: A Humanities Approach &lt;/em&gt;as well as other key topics related to leadership. While the study group is free and open to anyone, the &lt;a href="http://www.hmpublishing.com/ptk-leadership"&gt;leadership textbook&lt;/a&gt; is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa.cohort17.leadership.study.group"&gt;Cohort 17&lt;/a&gt; runs Thursday, September 25, through Wednesday, November 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I really benefited from this cohort in more ways than I can express,&amp;rdquo; said Theodore McCreadle, who signed up for and completed Cohort 15 upon being elected president of the Beta Gamma Sigma Chapter at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College in Ohio. &amp;ldquo;Not only did I read the book, but the discussions between those who had participated was valuable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Facebook group, many colleges offer a leadership class based on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s curriculum and textbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have seen amazing results and transformative experiences for students,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Jennifer Lane, Honors Program Coordinator at Glendale Community College in Arizona. &amp;ldquo;This course is working wonderfully on our campus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those interested in teaching the course must become certified through a Leadership Instructor Certification Seminar &amp;mdash; more than 2,700 educators from over 700 institutions have been certified since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This course is invaluable as a tool for chapter development,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Fritts, co-advisor of the Alpha Psi Tau Chapter at Ozarks Technical Community College in Missouri and Associate Regional Coordinator for the Missouri Region. &amp;ldquo;You will hear our students quote the text and the principles learned in the course and see evidence of behaviors that were directly impacted by the material.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leadership Instructor Certification Seminars are being scheduled for July 2015.

     <title>Membership Eligibility 101</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/member-eligibility-101 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-09-16T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Tuesday, September 16, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way that students and instructors review course requirements at the beginning of each semester, this is a great time to review the requirements for eligibility in Phi Theta Kappa. Consider this a refresher course!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average on a total of 12 hours of associate degree coursework completed at a two-year college, explains Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Regional and Chapter Development Courtney Lange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chapters may and often do set their own eligibility requirements over and above these minimums,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;In fact, most Phi Theta Kappa chapters require a 3.5 GPA to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That GPA is typically then lowered to what is known as a maintenance GPA, which members have to maintain in order to keep their member status.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each chapter does things a little differently, so be sure to review your chapter&amp;#39;s bylaws to learn its full eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa recognizes that community colleges are becoming increasingly diverse organizations &amp;mdash; often offering certificate, associate and baccalaureate degrees in fields ranging from welding to nursing to business administration. It is important to embrace the diversity of the community college system and to recognize that there is &amp;ldquo;no such thing as a typical Phi Theta Kappa student.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a former chapter advisor, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that all students &amp;mdash; traditional and non-traditional, full time and part time, career technical and academic, those online and on campus &amp;mdash; have something special to contribute to their local chapter, their region and to the larger community of Phi Theta Kappa scholars,&amp;rdquo; Lange said. &amp;ldquo;The list of unique characteristics that your prospective members share is long, but your message to them is the same: you are welcome in Phi Theta Kappa.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some commonly asked questions regarding eligibility. Study up, especially if your chapter is planning to host a Phi Theta Kappa Awareness Week. &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/awareness"&gt;More ideas and resources are available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are part-time students eligible for membership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part-time students are eligible if they have accumulated at least 12 hours over several academic terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are online students eligible for membership? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students who complete at least 12 credit hours of associate degree coursework with the required cumulative GPA are eligible for membership, regardless of the course format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is attendance at the induction ceremony mandatory to receive member status?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely not. Although we hope that you will take advantage of everything that Phi Theta Kappa has to offer, participation is not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are community college students eligible for membership if they do not plan to complete their associate degree but instead plan to transfer to a senior institution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Phi Theta Kappa, we strongly encourage students to complete an associate degree, before transferring to a four-year university, although it is not required for membership in Phi Theta Kappa. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are students pursuing certificate programs rather than associate degree programs eligible for membership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A certificate student may be eligible for membership if the student has accumulated at least 12 hours of coursework that could be applied toward an associate degree at the community college where the student is currently enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My community college offers baccalaureate degrees. Are those students also eligible for membership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phi Theta Kappa is the oldest and largest honor society, serving students at a two-year college. As long as the courses they are taking could be applied to an associate degree and they meet the requirements of membership in your chapter, they are eligible for membership in Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Provisional Membership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some chapters use provisional membership as a way to recognize and encourage students who are not yet eligible for membership in Phi Theta Kappa, while also giving them a taste of the Phi Theta Kappa experience. Provisional members are allowed to participate in chapter events, but are not eligible for the full benefits of membership like the ability to apply for scholarships or serve as a chapter officer. Provisional members are not reported to Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters&amp;mdash;meaning that they do not yet receive the full benefits of membership in Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are international students, those who are citizens of countries other than the country where they attend college, eligible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;International students attending college outside their home countries who possess full rights of citizenship of their countries are eligible for membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can transfer hours from other colleges be considered when determining membership eligibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courses taken at another institution may be considered when determining membership eligibility if this procedure is acceptable to the institution the student is currently attending. All courses considered must be applicable towards an associate degree at the student&amp;rsquo;s current institution. The decision should be addressed in the chapter&amp;#39;s bylaws and followed consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a high school student who is taking college credit be a member of Phi Theta Kappa?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A high school student enrolled at a two-year college who completes at least 12 credit hours of associate degree coursework with the required cumulative GPA is eligible for membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a community college student who has already earned a degree be a member?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A student with a degree who is enrolled at the two-year college is eligible for membership if that student completes at least 12 hours of associate degree coursework with the required cumulative GPA at the two-year college he or she is attending presently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a student attended our college several years ago and did not do well, do we have to consider those grades when determining the student&amp;rsquo;s eligibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Courses taken more than five years ago need not be considered when determining membership eligibility. However, the college administration has the prerogative of increasing the number of years that must elapse for waiving course consideration to any period beyond five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There was just one problem &amp;mdash; she would be graduating college with $80,000 in student loan debt. That&amp;rsquo;s when Jessie decided to go a different route from her friends and attend a community college instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/jessie_warme_cropped.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/jessie_warme_cropped.jpg?itok=5rjlBiUf" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014 Hites Scholar Jessie Warme&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Now she is a 2014 Hites Scholar, receiving a $7,500 scholarship to complete her baccalaureate degree &amp;mdash; and there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance she&amp;rsquo;ll have very little, if any, student loan debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;A social science/mathematics major and Phi Theta Kappa member at College of the Canyons in California, Warme is one of 10 two-year college students to be named a recipient of the 2014 Phi Theta Kappa Hites Transfer Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Hites Transfer Scholarship Program&lt;/a&gt; recognizes the outstanding academic achievement of Phi Theta Kappa members and provides $75,000 annually to selected scholars for the completion of a baccalaureate degree. The program was made possible through support from the Hites Family Community College Scholarship Foundation and the &lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Scholarships of $7,500 each were awarded to 10 students based on applications submitted by members. Students enrolled in associate degree programs and eligible to transfer to a regionally accredited baccalaureate degree-granting senior institution in the fall of 2014 were eligible to apply. Judges reviewed and scored applications for academic rigor, engagement and leadership. The 2014 Hites Transfer Scholars were selected from more than 2,200 applicants worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The 2014 Hites Transfer Scholars are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stacey Dawes, Connors State College, Oklahoma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Renee Duffy, SUNY Ulster, New York&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laura Edwards, Howard Community College, Maryland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holly Highfill, Santa Barbara City College, California&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chuong Le, Orange Coast College, California&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Megan Oleno, Paradise Valley Community College, Arizona&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Halina Miho Rachelson, Miami Dade College, Florida&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donald Evans Rimel, State College of Florida - Manatee-Sarasota, Florida&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heather Smyth, Mesa Community College, Arizona&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jessie Warme, College of the Canyons, California&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2010 the Hites Foundation gave a $250,000 grant in addition to matching donations to the Society&amp;rsquo;s Foundation 2-1 to create a $1 million scholarship endowment. Each year $75,000 in scholarships is awarded, $7,500 each to 10 Phi Theta Kappa members for the completion of a baccalaureate degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Hites Family Community College Scholarship Foundation was established by the late Robert Hites, an executive with Ralston-Purina in St. Louis, Missouri. Upon his retirement he fulfilled a lifelong dream and became an instructor at St. Louis Community College, where he valued the educational experience offered by community colleges and witnessed the determination and will to succeed of his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation is focused on long-term financial stability for the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. It is dependent upon the generosity of individuals, organizations, foundations and corporations to ensure its future through the support of existing and the establishment of new endowment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,280 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. Nearly 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 131,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Best Practices: Regional Honors Institute as a TEDx Event</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/regional-meeting-as-tedx-event 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-09-11T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, September 11, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the incoming president for the Upsilon Eta Chapter at Florida State College at Jacksonville, Justin Cran saw an opportunity to try something different as his chapter planned the 2014 Florida Regional Honors Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/FL%20region.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/FL%20region.jpg?itok=ZMfZAVhm" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendees of the recent Florida Regional Honors Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re always looking to try something new,&amp;rdquo; Cran said. &amp;ldquo;Being fresh to the position and not quite knowing what all is required gave me a little freedom to do something different.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter had been selected through a lottery system to host the Honors Institute. Rather than host it on their own campus, the chapter chose to host it July 11-12 at St. Johns River State College in St. Augustine. As the oldest city in the United States, the location lent itself well to the 2014-15 Honors Study Topic, &lt;em&gt;Frontiers and the Spirit of Exploration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They wanted to incorporate that historical aspect into it,&amp;rdquo; said Nell Freeman, advisor to the Alpha Xi Eta Chapter at St. Johns River State College. She and her chapter worked with their college on the logistics of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location may have been a nod to the past, but the format of the event was as &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo; as possible. A TEDx event utilizes live TED-like talks paired with previously recorded TED presentations. Three general sessions were held, each one featuring a live speaker and two pre-recorded TED talks related the Honors Study Topic themes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It fit well with the Honors Study Topic,&amp;rdquo; Cran said. &amp;ldquo;It was something that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been done before &amp;mdash; for our regional Honors Institute anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Walters, Upsilon Eta&amp;rsquo;s former chapter president, is the president and executive producer for his campus&amp;rsquo; TEDx club, TEDxFSCJ. As part of Upsilon Eta&amp;rsquo;s College Project in 2013, the chapter applied for a TED license. Although it wasn&amp;rsquo;t granted to the chapter, a professor on campus later applied for a license and received one on the condition that the organization be a collaborative effort between students and staff at the college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If there is a licensed TEDx group on campus, I would absolutely recommend a collaboration,&amp;rdquo; Walters said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa is a top-notch organization for smart people, and so is TED; it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect match.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group holds three salon events featuring pre-recorded TED presentations throughout the year, in addition to a TEDxFSCJ Conference. Members of the club also get experience in event planning, logistics, stage design, marketing, digital media, filming, preparing and coaching presenters and all other elements that go into preparing a TED-level conference. Walters and Cran worked together from the beginning to organize the TEDx event. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I knew he could help us narrow down what would be good to use and what would be suitable for the themes,&amp;rdquo; Cran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following each general session, 30-minute breakout sessions were held to discuss each talk. At the end of 30 minutes, attendees could move to a different breakout session to hear about a different presentation that was given for another 30 minutes. About 120 participants attended the Honors Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;TED Talks work for a conference like a Regional Honors Institute because there are so many different themes within the study topic,&amp;rdquo; Walters said. &amp;ldquo;TED Talks are generally under 20 minutes, so the time allows for each theme to be part of the conference in a short period of time and without fatiguing the audience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaborating with the TEDxFSCJ club allowed the Upsilon Eta chapter to concentrate on aspects of the conference that would make it a good experience without sacrificing the educational component, Walters said. And, the TED Talk videos were posted on the &lt;a href="http://www.tedxfscj.com"&gt;TEDxFSCJ website&lt;/a&gt; so members who were unable to attend the Regional Honors Institute could still benefit from the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The program was just the right balance between live speakers and TED Talk,&amp;rdquo; said Florida Regional Coordinator Connie LaMarca-Frankel. &amp;ldquo;I thought that the programming for this institute was one of the best I have experienced in my time as (regional) coordinator.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format reminded Freeman of the international Honors Institute hosted annually by Phi Theta Kappa. There was, however one notable difference: the length of the presentations. The live speaker was limited to 20 minutes, and the TED talks capped at 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been to talks before, and one area of improvement is with the live speakers and the length of time they speak,&amp;rdquo; Cran said. &amp;ldquo;This generation wants quicker content and more of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs, applauded the Florida Region&amp;rsquo;s new take on hosting such an event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What a great idea to combine the Florida Honors Institute with a TEDx event,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It is a best practice for regions and &amp;mdash; with substantive, intentional seminar meetings to add depth to the shorter presentations &amp;mdash; can work well as a prompt for Honors in Action research.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to selecting the live speakers and watching countless TED video talks, students from the Upsilon Eta Chapter also served as moderators for the breakout sessions. Freeman was impressed with all they accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The whole point is student participation,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It really develops great student leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;And the new format was really encouraging to small chapters like ours. We didn&amp;rsquo;t think our campus or our chapter was big enough to ever try to host it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the TEDx Program here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It provides students assistance with completing scholarship applications and support for completing an online portfolio for career and job enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thus, having a strong chapter is not only central to the mission of the community college, but it also demonstrates to students the college&amp;rsquo;s commitment to excellence and achievement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Star Chapter Plan puts the mission of Phi Theta Kappa into action through five levels of engagement that progress from local, campus involvement to regional and international involvement. Using the plan as a guide to success, chapters can enhance their working relationship with the college administration by becoming active on campus and in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, involvement in the program will educate chapter members in the importance of deadlines and organizational skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Five Star Plan is a barometer for Phi Theta Kappa that measures the engagement of our chapters,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;Participation at every level of the Five Star Plan is critical to fulfilling our mission, which is why we encourage all chapters to participate at the level that fits them best each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every chapter begins anew every calendar year, allowing chapters to have a fresh start and a challenging goal year after year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A breakdown of the plan can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/resources/chapter-leaders-guide"&gt;Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success.&lt;/a&gt; It includes a suggested timeline aimed at helping you complete your goal. All contact advisors should have received one earlier this year, and new advisors and chapter presidents also will receive this helpful tool as they are reported to Headquarters throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all begins with setting a goal for the year. Advisors and chapter officers should use the Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success to review the full list of requirements for all five levels of the plan and determine what level they are able to maintain based on their chapter planning for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal may be changed &amp;mdash; raised or lowered &amp;mdash; at any point based on progress throughout the year. Both advisors and chapter officers have access to update the progress report form for the chapter at any time during the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters can check their progress any time at the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/fivestar/overview/"&gt;Five Star Regional Overview&lt;/a&gt; page, which is updated nightly. &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;Use this form&lt;/a&gt; to report your progress throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline to report activities for 2014 is January 28, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-08-21T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, August 21, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, Mississippi - The Alpha Beta Eta Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa at Lurleen B. Wallace Community College in Andalusia, Alabama, is being recognized as a Top 100 Chapter, among nearly 1,300 chapters worldwide. The chapter will also receive recognition in the Honors in Action and Honors in Action Theme categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An award-winning chapter, Alpha Beta Eta has already received recognition as a Five Star Chapter at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention, &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/"&gt;NerdNation 2014&lt;/a&gt;, which was held at Disney&amp;rsquo;s Swan &amp;amp; Dolphin Resort in April. Advisor Heather Owen was also recognized as a Continued Excellence Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional recognition comes after a review of the scores revealed an error in the scoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, all chapters who participate in the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/docs/awards/2014_awards_program.pdf"&gt;Hallmark Awards Program&lt;/a&gt; are given an opportunity to review their scores. This provides transparency in judges&amp;#39; scoring and serves as a benchmark to improve scores for future entries, explained Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Upon discovering the error, Phi Theta Kappa staff members conducted a thorough review of scores recorded for all chapters in the 2014 Hallmark Awards program and found no further errors,&amp;quot; Risley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley applauded the work of the Alpha Beta Eta Chapter and extended congratulations to the chapter and college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Alpha Beta Eta Chapter will receive recognition for their achievement at the upcoming Alabama Regional Meeting, being held this fall,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Hallmark Awards Program, which reflects the scholarly ideals of Phi Theta Kappa, serves to recognize superior individual and chapter achievement in Society programs. The awards, based on competitively-judged applications, recognize individuals, chapters and regions for excellence in the Society&amp;#39;s Hallmarks of Scholarship, Leadership, Service and Fellowship as exemplified through Honors in Action activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Honors in Action Theme Award recognizes chapters whose Honors in Action Project Award entries scored highest in each of the 10 themes related to the 2012/2013 Honors Study Topic, &amp;quot;The Culture of Competition.&amp;quot; The Alpha Beta Eta Chapter won a theme award in the category &amp;quot;Competition and the Arts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Honors in Action Project Award recognizes the top chapters whose Honors in Action Project entries demonstrated excellence in academic research into the Honors Study Topic, leadership roles and leadership development activities, service learning and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. Nearly 3 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 131,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Ohio Regional Coordinator Carbone Accepts New Post in Michigan</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/cindy-carbone-resigns 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-08-20T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, August 20, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio Regional Coordinator Cindy Carbone has accepted a new position at Oakland Community College in Michigan and now serves as Dean of English and Communications. She will step down as Ohio Regional Coordinator, a post she has held since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/CindyCarbone.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/CindyCarbone.jpg?itok=h7rl7JoM" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cindy Carbone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbone currently serves as the Regional Coordinator Representative on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors. She will retain her position through July 31, 2015. Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Constitution and Board guidelines direct Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley to recommend to the Board a Regional Coordinator to serve the unexpired term, from August 2015 to April 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A call for nominations for Ohio Regional Coordinator has been distributed to all college presidents and chapter advisors in the region. As a new Regional Coordinator for Ohio is sought, Carbone will act as Ohio Senior Regional Coordinator to ensure a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am so proud of the Ohio Region and their growth over the last 10 years,&amp;rdquo; Carbone said. &amp;ldquo;It has been such a privilege to guide and lead them through these years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My heart will always be with Ohio and Phi Theta Kappa, but it is time to spread my wings in Michigan and mentor new advisors and new students. All my love and support go to the Ohio Region during this transition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbone served as a Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisor at Edison Community College from 1993 to 2009 and most recently as an advisor at Central Ohio Technical College. She succeeded Dr. John Kesler as Ohio Regional Coordinator and served as advisor of the Alpha of Ohio Region Alumni Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the region&amp;rsquo;s accomplishments under her leadership is the establishment of a specialty license plate dedicated to Phi Theta Kappa, the sales of which fund a Commit to Complete Scholarship for Ohio members.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbone was named a Distinguished Regional Coordinator in 2009 &amp;mdash; the top recognition provided a Regional Coordinator who has served at least five years. She has served in many leadership roles in Phi Theta Kappa over the years, including as an Honors Program Council member, a Faculty Scholar and a certified instructor of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Studies program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley appointed Carbone to the Society&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors in early 2012 upon the death of the late Texas Regional Coordinator Dr. Mary Hood, which she served until she was elected to a full three-year term during the Annual Convention in Nashville, Tennessee, that same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cindy has shown a strong commitment to Phi Theta Kappa and to the Ohio Region over the years, and we are grateful for her dedication,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;While we will miss her service to the Society, the Ohio Region and the Board of Directors, we are hopeful and confident that she will find a home in the Michigan Region and that we will see her again soon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Transfer Opportunities Lead Husband-Wife Alumni to Ole Miss</title>

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-08-13T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, August 13, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the college students returning to class in the coming weeks are Stephanie and Ian Rogers, a wife-husband team of Phi Theta Kappa alumni from Delgado Community College in Slidell, Louisiana, who worked with college advisors to meet their specific transfer needs and allow them both to continue their education at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/officer%20pic.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/officer%20pic.jpg?itok=gjSHc-kt" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie and Ian Rogers during their installation as Phi Theta Kappa chapter officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The help that we received was extremely helpful, considering at the time we were still both fulltime students and lived five hours away,&amp;rdquo; Ian said. &amp;ldquo;To know that Ole Miss took the time to help us as much as they did made me feel as if we were wanted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/family%20pic.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/family%20pic.jpg?itok=puaziXEP" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie and Ian Rogers with their son Greyson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple was also able to secure several scholarships to ease their financial burden. Ian was awarded a Phi Theta Kappa President Scholarship and a Phi Theta Kappa Transfer Scholarship. Stephanie received two Community College Academic Excellence Scholarships and a Phi Theta Kappa Transfer Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie, who was Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s 2014 New Century Scholar, also received a Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Class Scholarship, as well as the prestigious Lyceum Scholar Award &amp;mdash; a full resident tuition scholarship for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When students invest time and energy into exploring the transfer scholarships and opportunities in CollegeFish.org, particularly those available to Phi Theta Kappa members, there is great potential for reward, as Stephanie&amp;rsquo;s and Ian&amp;rsquo;s successes prove,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Blalock, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Support Officer. &amp;ldquo;The message here is to take an active role in your chapter, use the resources in CollegeFish.org, apply for every scholarships you&amp;rsquo;re eligible for, and you will see results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with several students who weren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to ask for more assistance from their transfer college or university of choice. My advice to students is if you don&amp;rsquo;t ask, the answer is always no. If you do, you increase your odds by 50 percent. Those are much better odds. Transfer admissions officers know how valuable an asset community college transfer students are to their campuses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie, 24, and Ian, 25, are non-traditional students with a 2-year-old son. Ian dropped out of high school when he was 16, received his GED and joined the army. Stephanie excelled in high school and joined the Navy JROTC. She joined the Army Reserve after high school but was injured in training and discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two married and moved to Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Ian was deployed for a year shortly after, and upon his return they moved to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. They started a family, Ian was discharged from the military, and they returned to Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We quickly realized that the options for those who do not have a college degree are extremely limited,&amp;rdquo; Stephanie said. &amp;ldquo;We knew that we needed to ensure a secure future for our family, and college would do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We chose a community college because it was smaller, more affordable and would allow us to transition back into school easier. I was also able to find class, work and daycare all in the same place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rogers immersed themselves into campus life at Delgado Community College. Both were inducted into Phi Theta Kappa, and they each soon took on leadership roles. Stephanie served as the Omega Nu&amp;rsquo;s Vice President of Scholarship, and Ian as the chapter&amp;rsquo;s Vice President of Leadership and later President.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I almost dropped out of college until I learned about Phi Theta Kappa,&amp;rdquo; Ian said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa gave me a reason to continue school.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie echoed his sentiment, adding that the Society became a way for her to make a difference on campus and in her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It allowed me to make friendships with like-minded students in college,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I do not have much free time between class, work and family to meet people, but I was able to meet other students who would be an excellent support system that I was able to grow with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both received Delgado Honors Excellence Awards in two areas, as well as Delgado Honors Scholarships while at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They are role models for other students, and hopefully hearing their story will encourage other students to know that yes, dreams can come true,&amp;rdquo; said Kim Russell, Omega Nu Chapter Advisor. &amp;ldquo;I have watched them make an educational plan for themselves and continue to stay focused on their goals. For being as young as they are, they are very wise for their ages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie and Ian visited several four-year college campuses as they prepared to transfer. A Phi Theta Kappa conference took them to the University of Mississippi, a school they didn&amp;rsquo;t really consider until they began speaking with people from the college. As they explained their unique situation to transfer advisors, they received assistance on many unexpected levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ole Miss is the only college that took extra time and energy into hearing about our needs as a family to succeed at their school,&amp;rdquo; Stephanie said. &amp;ldquo;Every college will tell you about their scholarships, but Ole Miss is the only one that could tell us about our daycare options in the area for our son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They told us about what having a family in Oxford is like and why going to their school would be a good fit for our son as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They even received help finding housing. Because the Rogers lived about five hours away, their transfer advisor would drive to places they found online and report back about the atmosphere, the commute and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve got to get involved and network,&amp;rdquo; Ian said. &amp;ldquo;Networking has made a tremendous difference in finding out about opportunities available to non-traditional students. Many universities value the diversity that non-traditional students bring to their communities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie will begin working this fall toward a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in general engineering with a Pre-Med emphasis. She ultimately plans to go to veterinary school. Ian is working toward a doctoral degree in geological engineering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Choosing a College Project</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/choosing-a-college-project 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-07-23T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, July 23, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of planning goes on during the summer; and as any successful Phi Theta Kappa chapter can attest, that planning should include a College Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the Honors in Action Project engages chapters with their surrounding community, the College Project encourages chapters to look closer to home &amp;mdash; on their college campuses &amp;mdash; for needs and opportunities to engage and give back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The College Project is a great opportunity to foster communication with your college administration,&amp;rdquo; said Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A College Project can also help a chapter achieve Three, Four or Five Stars in the Five Star Chapter Plan. More than 450 chapters submitted College Project Hallmark Award entries for 2014. Of those, 182 of them had a college completion focus. The rest focused on other service needs at the college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your College Project does not have to be sexy,&amp;rdquo; Edwards said. &amp;ldquo;It is all about communication between your chapter and your college administration to find a project that addresses a need related to your college&amp;rsquo;s mission.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters should start by meeting with college administrators to discuss those needs. Conversations and reflections with the administration should be ongoing throughout project planning and implementation and the assessments of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 Hallmark Awards applications will be available this fall, and rubrics for each category will be online soon on the Hallmark Awards page. Scores for 2014 College Project award entries have been emailed to the contact advisor for each chapter. Arm yourself with all of this information, and begin the planning process with the end in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Check out the College Project judging rubric, and consider it a planning rubric,&amp;rdquo; Edwards said. &amp;ldquo;Write up your project as a Hallmark Award entry, and share it with your college administration.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are samples of successful and award-winning College Projects. These projects were among the Top 25 submitted for 2014 Hallmark Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Omicron&lt;br /&gt;Tyler Junior College, Texas&lt;br /&gt;Topic: C2C &amp;ndash; Tyler Junior College&amp;rsquo;s Completion Initiative: Partnering C4 with Achieving the Dream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Omicron Chapter and the Tyler Junior College administrators met in January 2013 to reflect on the previous year&amp;rsquo;s College Project and discuss the focus for 2013. As discussions turned toward the chapter&amp;rsquo;s C4 outreach in 2012, it became apparent that the chapter had succeeded in addressing the student body but failed to address faculty, who had not been fully engaged with the college&amp;rsquo;s C4 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administrators suggested that the current focus should be on addressing faculty and added that the college&amp;rsquo;s Achieving the Dream (ATD) initiative &amp;mdash; aimed at improving student success &amp;mdash; should be integrated. A comprehensive program designed exclusively for the college and highlighting the combined resources available through C4 and ATD was requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C2C Committee began hosting small, informal discussions with faculty in conference rooms and faculty lounges, leading to conversations with approximately 80 percent of the faculty by the end of the fall semester. More than 185 faculty members signed Commit to Complete pledge cards. Talking points from the C2C program were incorporated into general education courses, required of all students, beginning with the fall 2014 semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Nu Sigma&lt;br /&gt;Horry-Georgetown Technical College, South Carolina&lt;br /&gt;Topic: Mentor Incoming Freshmen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The college president emphasized a need for the College Project to promote the use of resources available on campus for student success, including writing, math and computer skills labs boasting low student engagement. Never Overlook Roads That Help (NORTH) became the chapter&amp;rsquo;s project, to coordinate with the college&amp;rsquo;s Quality Enhancement Plan entitled Guided Plan for Success (GPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter members arranged visits with Freshman Skills classes to present the resources available to them for success on campus and the value of utilizing them. They developed a document containing tips for success in college &amp;mdash; including a &amp;ldquo;First Day of School&amp;rdquo; checklist &amp;mdash; and facilitated three new student orientations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NORTH reached nearly 600 students through the orientations and classes. Chapter members trained as public speakers and improved their communication skills in preparation for their presentations. And, feedback from freshmen revealed that they enjoyed the student-to-student interaction because they were able to relate more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zeta Sigma&lt;br /&gt;Texarkana College, Texas&lt;br /&gt;Topic: Hispanic Outreach and Recruitment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meeting with administrators revealed plans for the college to increase its Hispanic population through community outreach efforts. Therefore, the chapter chose to work as college ambassadors to educate the area Hispanic population on degree planning and financial aid options. Objectives included informing them of financial aid options for both documented and undocumented students and offering personal administrative assistance to those who may need help when applying for college and financial aid and choosing a degree plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter planned a presentation to be held following the Spanish Mass at local Catholic churches. College administrators and Hispanic students addressed parishioners, presented bilingual fliers and encouraged them to sign the Commit to Complete banner. In addition, a Hispanic Outreach Committee was formed and included several Hispanic community leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The college noticed a slight increase in the number of Hispanic students in 2013, from 208 in the spring to 243 in the fall. The chapter reached approximately 400 people through presentations at local churches and plans to expand the presentations to more churches in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha Kappa Sigma&lt;br /&gt;Red Rocks Community College, Colorado&lt;br /&gt;Topic: Community Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter adopted The Fox-Star Challenge to inspire and encourage students to participate in volunteer opportunities on campus and within the local community in an effort to boost their leadership and networking opportunities while encouraging them to embrace the &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; aspect of community college. Participants were encouraged to perform community service hours both individually and through group projects, and service opportunities ranged from rebuilding a scenic trail on campus to walking dogs from a shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service hours were recorded and displayed on a leader board in the main hallway on campus. Students recording the greatest number of hours were honored at a special recognition luncheon and received a personalized recommendation letter from the college president. Challenge participants were eligible to receive various other prizes, including a free three-credit class courtesy of the Marketing and Communications department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-six students completed a total of 2,111.75 hours of community service during the fall 2013 semester. In 2014, the program was expanded to include a Volunteer Fair featuring diverse organizations from the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Chapter Presents Honors in Action Research at Statewide Conference</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/chapter-presents-honors-research 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-07-17T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, July 17, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its 2013 Honors in Action project, the Upsilon Eta Chapter from Florida State College at Jacksonville-Kent Campus researched food deserts in Jacksonville. The results were surprising, but even more so was the chapter&amp;rsquo;s invitation to present its findings during the 2014 Florida Undergraduate Research Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/64077_386817398085441_1008913320_n_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/64077_386817398085441_1008913320_n_0.jpg?itok=4BJBtEX2" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013-14 Officers from the Upsilon Eta Chapter at Florida State College at Jacksonville-Kent Campus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Normally participants at this conference are at the university level, because community colleges typically aren&amp;rsquo;t involved in a lot of research,&amp;rdquo; said Keith Walters, 2013-14 chapter president. &amp;ldquo;But we submitted our abstract, and we were selected to present.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A food desert is loosely defined as an urban neighborhood and/or rural town without access to fresh, healthy and affordable food. Working under the 2012/2013 Honors Study Topic, &lt;em&gt;The Culture of Competition,&lt;/em&gt; the chapter sought to determine the relationship between a person&amp;rsquo;s socioeconomic status and his or her accessibility to supermarkets. The chapter compiled its findings at &lt;a href="http://competitionforfood.com/"&gt;competitionforfood.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topic of food deserts had been in the news lately in the Jacksonville area, and it piqued the interest of the chapter officer team. Seven percent of Jacksonville&amp;rsquo;s residents &amp;mdash; greater than the national average of five percent &amp;mdash; are living in a food desert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their research, chapter members discovered that zip codes with a higher average income among its residents also boasted greater access to supermarkets. Access to supermarkets and therefore healthy, more nutritious food was limited in zip codes with lower income levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We wanted to do a really thorough and objective research project,&amp;rdquo; Walters said. &amp;ldquo;All of the officers knew we wanted to go get a graduate degree, so we wanted to get familiar with the research process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group &amp;mdash; particularly Walters, Amy Brownfield and Stephanie Hughes, authors of the project &amp;mdash; turned to faculty members who had recently completed doctorate degrees for guidance on the research process. They purposefully chose faculty members with varied backgrounds to get a wide array of perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We spent a lot of time just on the writing,&amp;rdquo; Walters said. &amp;ldquo;Obviously this is something that will be invaluable as we write research papers on the graduate level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience actually came in handy in just the next semester, as Walters enrolled in a Business Statistics class. That class focused on research similar to the kind he had just finished for his Honors in Action project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I learned it outside the classroom before the class even started,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three months, when the research was completed, the data examined and the paper written, the chapter held a mock defense to defend its findings, attended by the college president and about 40 college administrators. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was very proud of my students with the quality of work and the manner in which they presented themselves as they defended their research,&amp;rdquo; said chapter advisor Dr. Mary James. &amp;ldquo;It really reminded me of my dissertation defense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team shared its research with county health department officials as well as with researchers from the University of Florida, aiming to spread its findings by any means possible. The team was even asked to help develop a mobile famers market to serve food insecure areas. The chapter was also named a Top 100 Chapter during NerdNation 2014 in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, being invited to present during the 2014 Florida Undergraduate Research Conference was the icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The success of the research was great,&amp;rdquo; Walters said. &amp;ldquo;We had validation in the work we did. We felt we did a good job, which was an important feeling when we&amp;rsquo;d worked so hard on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Has your chapter planned its Honors in Action Project yet?

     <title>Honors Institute Changes Lives in Many Ways</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/Honors-Institute-Changes-Lives 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-07-16T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, July 16, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the months leading up to the 2014 Honors Institute, first-time Faculty Scholar Kari Kahler, who serves as Michigan Regional Coordinator, wondered how she would create a meaningful experience for her seminar group, composed of regional officers from around the world. As it turned out, an unplanned experience would change the lives of the members of Seminar Group 9, and they would learn valuable lessons far beyond the campus of Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/2014HonorsInstitute.jpeg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2014HonorsInstitute.jpeg?itok=0Ip99iXQ" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Walker and Brandi Husch share their experiences with Foundation CEO Dr. Nancy Rieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/seminar9web.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/seminar9web.jpg?itok=AyRka4fw" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seminar Group 9 is pictured with Dr. Rieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My biggest take-away from Honors Institute 2014 was to experience the incredible passion of Phi Theta Kappa members honoring one of their own with genuine compassion, incredible leadership and thoughtful action,&amp;rdquo; Kahler said. &amp;ldquo;Sometimes, even seasoned leaders learn to step back and let events unfold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those events began to unfold on Wednesday, June 18, as part of an Honors Institute outing in St. Louis. Phi Theta Kappa had organized a riverboat ride along the Mississippi with Gateway Cruises. The students had learned about the history of the riverfront, including the courthouse made famous by the Dred Scott decision and the landmark Gateway Arch. As the buses filled with Honors Institute participants arrived for the cruise, they were re-directed due to construction on the riverfront in front of the riverboat entrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Walker, a Georgia Regional Officer who uses a walker, and Denise Keller, Indiana Regional President who uses a cane, found themselves dropped off several blocks away from the dock with the rest of their seminar group. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Schutt, Greater Northwest Regional Vice President for District III, searched for a safe route to the riverboat, but unfortunately the only way down was a steep, unshaded staircase. Keller was able to make it, but Walker was struggling to descend the crumbling steps with the help of Indiana Regional Public Relations Officer Denise Lynch. Due to the 94-degree heat, the mile-long walk and the numerous steps, Walker and Lynch missed the 1:30 p.m. cruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schutt had agreed to go ahead to request that a wheelchair be brought to help Walker get to the dock in time for the next scheduled cruise at 3 p.m. She texted back to Lynch that a wheelchair was on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am so amazed by the strength of character that Janet and the two Denises showed,&amp;rdquo; Schutt said. &amp;ldquo;They are amazing women, and I am so happy to know them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A riverboat cruise employee returned shortly with the wheelchair and, according to Lynch, was very helpful, professional and courteous in helping Walker get to the cruise. However, she added that the wheelchair provided was unstable, leaving Walker very nervous that she would tip over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The wheelchair almost got away from him three times although I was bracing it on the downslope side,&amp;rdquo; Lynch explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving at the boat, Lynch insisted upon giving the riverboat employee a $20 tip, although he said they owed him nothing. At first he refused, but she encouraged him to donate the money to charity if he wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker and Lynch then enjoyed the riverboat ride and located Phi Theta Kappa staff members, who helped make arrangements to assist Walker back to the buses. The two members spent the rest of the afternoon exchanging ideas about their chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I picked her brain and got two pages of notes filled with great ideas to promote Phi Theta Kappa, increase membership and member involvement,&amp;rdquo; Lynch said. &amp;ldquo;I told Janet that it turned out to be a blessing to spend the afternoon with her, since she was a really nice person and had many great ideas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening as Seminar Group 9 shared their experiences of the day, Walker took her turn to speak and told fellow members about her day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Because of my experience, I wanted to pay it forward by getting the riverboat landing a better wheelchair to assist others who are disabled,&amp;rdquo; she said. As the group became somewhat angry as she told of her experience, Walker said, &amp;ldquo;I told the group it did nothing to get mad or frustrated, but I could help find a way to help others in the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our seminar group was overwhelmed with her thoughtfulness and how she chose to create a better experience for others rather than blame the company or wallow in self-pity about her afternoon,&amp;rdquo; Kahler said. &amp;ldquo;They reached into their pockets and shared with Janet everything they had.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kahler explained that Brandi Husch, Regional Vice President for Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Southern District of Illinois, was so moved that she inspired many attending the Honors Institute to join in the cause and was instrumental in the amount of money collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker promised to research wheelchair prices and report to the group at Friday&amp;#39;s seminar meeting. By Friday evening the group had collected more than $755.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Janet Walker is an extremely amazing individual who has forever changed how I look at certain situations in my life,&amp;rdquo; Husch said. &amp;ldquo;The whole story represents why I love Phi Theta Kappa so much, and I am honored and humbled to be a part of it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the group debriefed during the Friday evening seminar session, they were joined by Dr. Nancy Rieves, CEO of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, and turned the money over to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon returning from Honors Institute, Rieves contacted Gateway Cruises and explained what had transpired. Karen Bolinger, Director of Sales and Marketing responded. &amp;quot;Please accept our apologies for the challenges students faced in getting around the riverfront,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Second, what a neat bunch of students &amp;ndash; rallying around their friend!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this experience, Bolinger shared that Gateway Cruises will internally review their equipment and protocols to ensure they are able to provide better assistance for this type of scenario in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please redirect the funds to your organization,&amp;quot; Bolinger said. &amp;quot;While the students&amp;rsquo; intent is admirable, their efforts should be directed to support your mission.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieves explained that the funds collected by Seminar Group 9 will now be directed to the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship and will be awarded to a member with disability needs who applies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is a wonderful example of how seminar groups pull together to help one another,&amp;rdquo; said Susan Edwards, Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs. &amp;ldquo;The bonding that takes place at Honors Institute represents Phi Theta Kappa fellowship at its best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We hear wonderful stories about paying it forward,&amp;rdquo; Kahler added. &amp;ldquo;But for Seminar Group 9, we were able to live it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Secrets of the 2014 Most Distinguished Chapter’s Success</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/secrets-of-2014-mdc 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-07-10T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, July 10, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the 2013-2014 chapter officer team from the Alpha Zeta Omicron Chapter at Cedar Valley College in Texas left their successors a detailed, 17-point list of instructions on establishing and maintaining a successful chapter. It&amp;rsquo;s good advice to follow: the Alpha Zeta Omicron Chapter was named Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s 2014 Most Distinguished Chapter during NerdNation 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/most_distinguished_chapter.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/most_distinguished_chapter.jpg?itok=lXQktKTN" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Alpha Zeta Omicron Chapter on stage at NerdNation 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When we were announced, I was ecstatic beyond belief,&amp;rdquo; said Toby Lasco, former chapter president. &amp;ldquo;As I went up with my chapter to receive the award, I did a mental recap of every bit of effort we invested in our chapter the previous year. I also thought about the fact that this is undoubtedly the greatest accomplishment any of us had achieved thus far in our lives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of Alpha Zeta Omicron&amp;rsquo;s success lies in the development of its chapter officer team. The team is elected in April and takes office in May of each year. Two retreats are planned, during which officers participate in leadership development and team-building activities. The team also uses resources from Phi Theta Kappa to set its calendar and begin planning its year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We take the Five Star Chapter Plan, the Honors Study Topic Guide, the Leadership textbook and the Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Tommy Thompson, currently serving his 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; year as chapter advisor. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s so much information out there. Every chapter officer and chapter advisor needs to have these materials at their fingertips if they really want to see what they can do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team jumps right into the planning and research phases of its Honors in Action and College Projects. An initial topic is chosen, questions are developed and research on those questions is completed in July. Before the fall semester begins, a topic is refined and selected, and the first week of August is spent creating and planning the action step. The action step or event is implemented by the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing for the Hallmark Award essay questions is done throughout the project, with a first draft completed in August. The team will go through 10 or 12 drafts of their Hallmark Awards applications before submitting a final. To keep up with and encourage writing and note taking along the way, each officer is given a notebook when they are installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re not journaling and taking notes, then it&amp;rsquo;s like trying to pull a research paper together at the last minute,&amp;rdquo; Thompson said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just not going to work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter has also found success through its attendance of regional and international events. Chapter officers, members and advisors attend and present at educational forums during the events. They have attended the Phi Theta Kappa Academy immediately prior to Annual Convention, and they regularly send at least one chapter officer to Honors Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Honors Institute is something we greatly value,&amp;rdquo; Thompson said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s very important to get that perspective on the Honors Study Topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t go to the events, then you&amp;rsquo;re falling behind. You&amp;rsquo;re not learning. We learn as we go, and we grow over the year. Through participating like this, we have really seen the value of Phi Theta Kappa and the Phi Theta Kappa Experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s officers were Five Star Competitive Edge members, an accomplishment that both Thompson and the 2013-14 officer team believe helped the chapter&amp;rsquo;s success. In fact, points 11 and 12 on the list of advice for new officers recommend reaching the Three Star Level in mid-July and the Five Star Level by early October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winning Alpha Zeta Omicron officer team &amp;mdash; which also received a Distinguished Chapter Officer Team Award &amp;mdash; also urges its successors to read the chapter bylaws, learn to delegate, learn to work autonomously and to get to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I believe one of the aspects that set my chapter apart from others was the unity of our officer team,&amp;rdquo; said John MacLean, Alpha Zeta Omicron&amp;rsquo;s former vice president of leadership. &amp;ldquo;As the year passed, we developed friendships, making the time we spent together on projects a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing can be worse than pursuing a team goal with a bunch of people you hardly know. Never forget to have fun.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Zeta Omicron Chapter received the following Hallmark Awards during NerdNation 2014 in Orlando, Florida:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;2014 Most Distinguished Chapter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished Chapter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished Theme Award &amp;ndash; Honors in Action: Theme 1 &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s All in Your Mind: Foundations of Competition/Competition and Psychology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished Honors in Action Project Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished College Project Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished Chapter Officer Team Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 100 Chapter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Called the &amp;ldquo;crown jewel of Phi Theta Kappa programming,&amp;rdquo; the week-long exploration of the Society&amp;rsquo;s Honors Study Topic includes internationally recognized speakers, small group seminars, educational field trips and experiential activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/johnbook_1.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/johnbook_1.jpg?itok=rHFtjMbB" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaker Patrick Lee (as Captain William Clark) signs a copy of his book for Dr. John Modschiedler, the sponsor of his Honors Institute lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Fedor_Ramirez_HI14%20%282%29_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Fedor_Ramirez_HI14%20%282%29_0.jpg?itok=_v-Ka8OG" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joan Fedor visits with speaker Ken Ramirez, whose lecture she sponsored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What many of those 500 attendees may not know is that their experience was made possible by a group of former advisors, regional coordinators, alumni and friends who did an extraordinary thing. Passionate about opportunities for Phi Theta Kappa members, they had the vision and commitment to sponsor lectures for the Honors Institute with financial gifts to the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation is grateful for the sponsors of the Honors Institute lecture series, who made this outstanding program possible for the 2014 Honors Institute,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Nancy Rieves, CEO of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation. &amp;ldquo;We encourage those who&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from their generosity to say thank you to our lecture sponsors for making Honors Institute the high-quality program that it is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants may send messages of thanks to &lt;a href="mailto:foundation@ptk.org?subject=Thank%20you"&gt;foundation@ptk.org&lt;/a&gt; and they will be shared with sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Ecton, a member of the Pi Theta Chapter at Hagerstown Community College who serves as Maryland State President for the Middle States Region, said he&amp;rsquo;s grateful to those who created the Honors Institute, endowed lectures and developed the Honors Study Topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Honors Institute is greatly enriched thanks to the generosity of its sponsors,&amp;rdquo; Ecton said. &amp;ldquo;This experience has allowed me the opportunity not only to develop my own leadership skills in service to Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s future, but to also reflect on the leadership that was required in the past to get us all to this point.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We think it was cool that some of the lecture sponsors actually attended our general sessions,&amp;rdquo; said Lisette Dalton, Kentucky Regional President of Honors in Action. &amp;ldquo;It showed us how much value they placed in our general session speakers.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Knowing that the amazing speakers we have heard come at a high cost, the lecture sponsors allow the registration to be obtainable for students to attend Honors Institute,&amp;rdquo; said Shawna Gaccetta, a member of the Beta Delta Omicron Chapter at Tarrant County College and President of the Texas Region. &amp;ldquo;These sponsors allow Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s legacy of excellence to continue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following individuals sponsored lectures at the 2014 Honors Institute:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. John Modschiedler, long-time advisor at College of DuPage in Illinois, sponsor of:&lt;br /&gt;The Modschiedler Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Captain William Clark&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Frontiers and the Exploration of the West&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Janice Freeman and Dr. Joyce Freeman, alumni and long-time advisors at Wharton County Junior College in Texas, sponsors of:&lt;br /&gt;The Freeman Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Nina Tandon&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Frontiers of Health and Medicine: Where Sci-Fi Meets Reality&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leanne Jardine, alumna and former New York Regional Coordinator, and Richard Jardine, sponsors of:&lt;br /&gt;The Jardine Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Ray Arvidson&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Celestial Frontiers: Lessons from the Earth and Planetary Remote Sensing Laboratory&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Blank, former New York Regional Coordinator, sponsor of:&lt;br /&gt;The Blank Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Prof. Dan Rooney, Prof. Steve Schroeder and Dr. Patricia Scott West&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring the Gateway to the West: St. Louis, Missouri&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fifth General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Joan Fedor, International Honorary Member, former Washington Regional Coordinator, and the late Bob Fedor, sponsors of:&lt;br /&gt;The Fedor Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Ken Ramirez&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring the Natural World: Frontiers in Animal Training&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sixth General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The late June Cordier, International Honorary Member, sponsor of:&lt;br /&gt;The Cordier Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Sylvia Earle&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Exploring Under the Seas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seventh General Session&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gayle Wyatt, former Headquarters staff member who helped develop the Honors Institute, sponsor of:&lt;br /&gt;The Wyatt Lecture&lt;br /&gt;Pokey LaFarge&lt;br /&gt;&amp;rdquo;Quest for Human Expression in the American Song Book&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fedor, who also serves as a member of the Honors Program Council, has said that for her, Honors Institute was &amp;ldquo;love at first sight.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I think about opportunities in Phi Theta Kappa I keep coming back to the Honors Institutes. I think our speakers contributed to international understanding long before we had the internet and email to bring us closer together,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Having international speakers come and talk was an incredible chance for our students to learn.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modschiedler was the first to dub the Honors Institute &amp;ldquo;the crown jewel of Phi Theta Kappa programming.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The camaraderie for students, the academic experience, are like nothing else,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa has been the pinnacle of my community college experience, and I wanted to give something back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieves encourages others with a passion for Phi Theta Kappa to join these lecture sponsors in continuing Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s legacy of excellence. For more information about how you can participate, contact Rieves at &lt;a href="mailto:nancy.rieves@ptk.org"&gt;nancy.rieves@ptk.org&lt;/a&gt; and learn more at the Foundation &lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Divisional Team Leaders are Valuable Resources for Regions, Chapters</title>

One of each is assigned to the chapters in each division:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division I&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development: &lt;a href="mailto:onjalai.flake@ptk.org"&gt;Onjalai Flake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key Services Consultant: &lt;a href="mailto:danya.stuart@ptk.org"&gt;Danya Stuart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division II&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development: &lt;a href="mailto:courtney.lange@ptk.org"&gt;Courtney Lange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key Services Consultant: &lt;a href="mailto:melissa.price@ptk.org"&gt;Melissa Price&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division III&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development: &lt;a href="mailto:mia.ramos@ptk.org"&gt;Mia Ramos-Shirley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key Services Consultant: &lt;a href="mailto:paige.still@ptk.org"&gt;Paige Still&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division IV&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Associate Director of Regional and Chapter Development: &lt;a href="mailto:dawneen.banks@ptk.org"&gt;Dawneen Banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key Services Consultant: &lt;a href="mailto:fredrica.packnett@ptk.org"&gt;Fredrica Packnett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divisional Team Leaders provide resources and hands-on assistance for chapter and regional leaders in membership acceptance campaigns as well as in engaging members in the Phi Theta Kappa Experience through benefits, programs and conferences. They have a vast knowledge of a variety of Society programs and initiatives, including Honors in Action, the Five Star Chapter Plan, Competitive Edge, CollegeFish.org, NerdNation, Honors Institute and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our Divisional Team Leaders really are Phi Theta Kappa gurus,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;They each have had their own unique experiences with Phi Theta Kappa that especially qualify them to work side-by-side with our regional and chapter leaders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lange, who also serves as Director of Regional and Chapter Development, is a former chapter advisor from Holmes Community College in Ridgeland, Mississippi, which has been recognized as a Top 10 Most Distinguished Chapter by the Society. She attended numerous regional and international events as an advisor, including the first Advisor Institute held in 2013, and she recently completed her master&amp;#39;s degree in communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel as though the AD role can be summed up very simply by saying that we are ambassadors,&amp;rdquo; Lange said. &amp;ldquo;From the standpoint of Phi Theta Kappa, we serve as ambassadors as we promote awareness and encourage student engagement in Society programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;From the standpoint of regional and chapter leaders, we again serve as ambassadors as we carry the messages of students, advisors, regional coordinators, community leaders and college administrators back to Headquarters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flake is a Phi Theta Kappa member from Mt. Hood Community College in Oregon, where she held both local and regional leadership roles. She also served as the 2010-2011 International Vice President for Division IV, and she was a 2011 Guistwhite Scholar. Prior to joining Phi Theta Kappa as a staff member, she worked as the Student Orientation Coordinator at George Fox University in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramos-Shirley has been a Phi Theta Kappa member for more than 10 years, having served as a chapter, regional and international officer along the way. While at Columbia University, she chartered the first Phi Theta Kappa alumni chapter at an Ivy League school. She previously worked as the Assistant Director of Programs (New Colleges) at Achieving the Dream, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks has been a Phi Theta Kappa member for nearly 12 years and is a charter member of the Beta Kappa Lambda Chapter at Aims Community College in Colorado. She served as the Colorado Regional Vice President and was the first student from Colorado elected to International Office. She previously worked as a Manager of Business Development for Ellucian, formerly known as SunGard Higher Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;These AD&amp;rsquo;s have been in the shoes of our members and our advisors,&amp;rdquo; Stanford said. &amp;ldquo;They have faced the same struggles, and they have had the same questions and concerns. They are ready and able to extend their knowledge and experience to our regions and chapters, and they are committed to seeing the chapters in each of our four divisions grow and succeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AD&amp;rsquo;s work alongside regional leaders to help educate new advisors, plan conferences, orientate regional officers and set regional goals. They provide training at chapter and regional conferences, and they provide direct support to advisors on reporting members and managing chapter operations through PAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also work closely with the International Officers, coaching and guiding them as they serve as liaisons between chapters and Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having three former International Officers as part of the Regional and Chapter Development Team, we feel as though we are really able to arm them with the information and tools needed to be successful ambassadors for Phi Theta Kappa,&amp;rdquo; Lange said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask an AD what the best part of her job is, and her answer will depend on what time of year it is. In February, they assist with Hallmark Awards judging. In April, they&amp;rsquo;re gearing up for NerdNation. In May and December, they&amp;rsquo;re seeing the students in their divisions honored with life-changing scholarship offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;For me, the bottom line is that Phi Theta Kappa has been changing the lives of students for almost a century now,&amp;rdquo; Lange said. &amp;ldquo;I am so grateful to be connected to that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the AD&amp;rsquo;s are often traveling throughout their divisions, the Key Services Consultants maintain a home base at the Center for Excellence where they can be easily reached with questions or concerns. Stuart, Price, Still and Packnett have more than 10 years of combined experience at Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our Key Services Consultants are an integral part of our engagement with our regions and chapters,&amp;rdquo; said Wendy Giammarco, Director of Key and Conference Services. &amp;ldquo;The knowledge they possess allows them to assist our regional coordinators, advisors and members with virtually anything, from chapter chartering and member recruitment to advisor education.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Candidate Finalists Spark Additional Giving by Oberndorf Family Foundation</title>

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-06-25T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, June 25, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jackson, Mississippi&lt;strong&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Phi Theta Kappa member Christina Urbina recently ran for Division II International Vice President, and although she was a finalist for the position, she did not win. However, that&amp;rsquo;s not the way Urbina sees it &amp;mdash; she came away with a $500 scholarship from the Oberndorf Family Foundation and may have found her life&amp;rsquo;s calling in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/finalist_0.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/finalist_0.jpg?itok=7HfOZuOG" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10 Candidate Finalists celebrate at NerdNation 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Oberndorfsweb.jpeg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Oberndorfsweb.jpeg?itok=eSqChWyr" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou and Rosemary Oberndorf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;As an International Officer Candidate Finalist at NerdNation 2014, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention held in Orlando April 24-26, Urbina and nine other finalists of the 27 who ran for office had the opportunity to present a speech on the Society&amp;rsquo;s Honors Study Topic, &lt;em&gt;Frontiers and the Spirit of Exploration,&lt;/em&gt; to more than 4,000 attendees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In the audience philanthropist and Phi Theta Kappa Foundation Trustee Lou Oberndorf and his wife, Rosemary, were incredibly impressed &amp;mdash; not just with the five candidates who were eventually elected, but with all 10 of the students who gave speeches. By the end of NerdNation, they announced they would fund a new scholarship that would award $500 scholarships to each of the 10 International Officer Finalists for the next five years, a $25,000 commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou Oberndorf was a founder of METI, a world leader in medical education technology. As CEO of METI, he was responsible for establishing the Frank Lanza Memorial Scholarships for community college students in health care fields. He and his wife Rosemary helped establish the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship, matching Foundation contributions one-to-one to provide a $500,000 endowment for the scholarships, which are directed to community college students at risk of dropping out due to financial hardships. Last year, $20,000 in scholarships were presented to members in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Receiving the scholarship was unexpected, yet thrilling,&amp;rdquo; Urbina said. &amp;ldquo;I will be able to spread out my final classes between two semesters thanks to the $500 scholarship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Following the 2014 Annual Convention, the five new International Officers and the five finalists were awarded $5,000 in scholarships, each receiving a check of $500. The 2014 recipients were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For International President - Eric Mueller of Coffeyville Community College in Kansas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For Division I Vice President - Megan Sims of Southwest Virginia Community College in Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For Division II Vice President - Christina Urbina of Polk State College in Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For Division III Vice President - Rashida Jones-Frazier of Oklahoma State University-Oklahoma City in Oklahoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For Division IV Vice President - Sheena McPeek of Central Community College-Grand Island in Nebraska&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014-15 International Officers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;International President - Ebonee Carpenter of Hillsborough Community College in Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Division I Vice President - Megan Giles of Harrisburg Area Community College in Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Division II Vice President - Jesus Tovar of El Paso Community College in Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Division III Vice President - Trevor Mileur of Illinois Central College in Illinois&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Division IV Vice President - Ivette Piña of Phoenix Community College in Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon successful completion of their terms, the five International Officers will receive an additional $10,000 in scholarships &amp;mdash; $2,000 each plus a stipend to cover expenses associated with serving. Learn more about them and their year ahead &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/get-to-know-2014-2015-IOs"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Student Engagement Officer Jennifer Stanford said the International Officer Campaign is an extraordinary leadership opportunity in itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Out of 130,000 members inducted every year, usually less than 30 seek out the highest position of leadership we call International Office. Furthermore, only 10 of those will become Candidate Finalists,&amp;rdquo; Stanford said.&amp;rdquo; To give a speech on our Honors Study Topic in front of 4,000 audience members is quite an accomplishment! How wonderful it is to have Rosemary and Lou Oberndorf recognize the hard work and courage of these individuals with a scholarship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Campaigning was a great experience for all members involved. Phi Theta Kappa provided another unique opportunity at leadership development and scholarly fellowship through the election of international officers,&amp;rdquo; said candidate Eric Mueller, who plans to use his scholarship to buy a laptop computer needed for classes. &amp;ldquo;There are no losers among candidates. Running for international office introduced me to so many inspiring people that I believe will change the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I appreciate Mr. and Mrs. Oberndorf&amp;#39;s continued dedication to Phi Theta Kappa and its aspiring leaders. They truly recognize the effort required of all finalists and the influence this organization has had on our lives.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urbina said the campaign was an eye-opening experience for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After speaking in front of over 4,000 Phi Theta Kappa members, I realized that I want to be a motivational speaker. With the help of my college President Dr. Holden, I am starting my own business as a public speaker,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I never would have thought it was possible, until I ran for this position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I might not have been chosen for the position, but I won because I found my true calling. I have received letters and messages from members who heard my story and said it changed their way of thinking. I helped make a difference in others&amp;rsquo; lives, and that is truly what I wanted out of this endeavor.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urbina said she would encourage others to take the opportunity to run for a Phi Theta Kappa International Office. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The experience will change your life and open new doors,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about running for International Office &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/campaign-for-an-office/international-officer/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

     <title>AACC Makes $10,000 Donation to New Pierce Scholarship Fund</title>

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-06-25T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, June 25, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, Mississippi &amp;ndash; When Michelle Machado Davis was growing up in Brazil, she had to walk several miles to and from school every day &amp;mdash; often in shoes that didn&amp;rsquo;t fit, either too small or stuffed with tissues so that she could grow into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/davisgradweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/davisgradweb.jpg?itok=2CWeESMN" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Davis (Photo Courtesy of Collin College/Nick Young, photographer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/DavidPierceweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/DavidPierceweb.jpg?itok=u9r5ufLR" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. David R. Pierce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But today, Davis has shoes that fit just fine; and as the first David R. Pierce Scholar, she&amp;rsquo;s become a quickly rising star in the community college universe. For her, it&amp;rsquo;s not about the $1,000 Pierce Scholarship she received in addition to the scholarships of $2,500 as a member of the All-USA Community College Academic Team and $2,000 as Texas&amp;rsquo;s New Century Scholar. It&amp;rsquo;s about feeling comfortable in her own shoes in more ways than one; ready to walk ahead into the better life she&amp;rsquo;s built for herself and her family.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) has kicked off the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&amp;rsquo;s campaign to raise funds for the David R. Pierce Scholarship with a gift of $10,000 to make sure that more students like Davis get the recognition they deserve and the scholarships they need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation announced that the Society would honor the memory of former AACC President and Phi Theta Kappa Board Vice Chair Dr. David R. Pierce with the establishment of a scholarship in his name. The $1,000 scholarship will be presented annually to the student chosen to represent the All-USA Community College Academic Team by speaking during the Closing Plenary Brunch at the AACC annual convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We wanted to do something in memory of David, and the extraordinary leadership he provided to AACC, and the exceptional man that he was,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Walter Bumphus, President and CEO of AACC. &amp;ldquo;Recognizing how important Phi Theta Kappa was to David and the great value he and his family placed on community college students, we thought it only fitting that we make a contribution to the inaugural Pierce Scholarship in his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierce served as president of AACC from 1991-2000 and as a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Board of Directors for 11 years, serving as Vice Chair from 2001-2003. He provided extraordinary leadership to both organizations and was respected by his peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon his death in early 2014, the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation wanted to establish a scholarship in his memory with the donations received in his honor. Maureen Pierce, his wife, and his family requested that the scholarship be awarded to a community college student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Phi Theta Kappa introduced the inaugural All-USA Community College Team at AACC during the Society&amp;#39;s Presidents Breakfast. Pierce, then president of AACC, requested that Phi Theta Kappa continue to recognize the All-USA Team annually at AACC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is fitting that the David R. Pierce Scholarship be presented to the scholar selected each year from the All-USA Community College Academic Team to represent and speak on behalf of the scholars at AACC&amp;#39;s Annual Convention,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Nancy Rieves, CEO of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation. &amp;ldquo;As a former president of AACC, it seems appropriate to remember Dr. Pierce among his peers and the scholars of the nation&amp;rsquo;s community colleges.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The All-USA program is widely recognized as the most prestigious academic honor for students attending community college. Nominees are hand-selected by college presidents or their designated nominator for demonstrating academic rigor, leadership and civic growth. The program also recognizes students who extend their community college education to better themselves, their schools and their surrounding communities. A student does not have to be a member of Phi Theta Kappa to be selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first David R. Pierce Scholarship was awarded to Michelle Davis during the 2014 AACC Annual Convention on April 8 in Washington, D.C. A business major at Collin College in Texas, Davis hopes to earn a baccalaureate degree and become a tax accountant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the AACC Convention, Davis told her story of emerging from a childhood of poverty in Brazil, overcoming a language barrier and many other obstacles to earn a 4.0 grade point average. She persevered to complete her associate degree even as she miscarried, her husband was diagnosed with cancer and the family struggled with medical bills due to lack of health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Determination, unwavering hope, persistence and a powerful support system sustained me when I encountered difficulties in my journey through school,&amp;rdquo; Davis said. &amp;ldquo;Instead of focusing on problems at hand, I focused on end results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sleepless nights did not keep me from going to school the following mornings. I still studied for tests while tears rolled down my eyes. In the midst of storms, I learned precious lessons about resilience and the importance of having a support system around me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis said Phi Theta Kappa has been a crucial support system to her and the highlight of her educational journey; that being a member taught her the value of giving back to her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieves said the Foundation is extremely grateful for the gift from AACC, as they are actively seeking donations to provide future scholarships to students like Davis &amp;mdash; particularly from college presidents and administrators &amp;mdash; to fund the David R. Pierce Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Pierce would have been so proud to hear Michelle&amp;rsquo;s story and the role we played in it,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;A gift to this scholarship fund is also a wonderful way to remember a truly great community college leader.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rieves said donations for the Pierce Scholarship are starting to roll in from presidents and administrators around the country who remember Pierce fondly and want to show their support for scholarships that benefit outstanding community college students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on how to contribute to the David R. Pierce Scholarship fund or other scholarships for Phi Theta Kappa members through the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, contact Philanthropy Coordinator Karri Chaney at &lt;a href="mailto:karri.chaney@ptk.org?subject=Pierce%20Scholarship"&gt;karri.chaney@ptk.org&lt;/a&gt; or 601.987.5507, or give online at the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/ptkfoundation?code=Standard+Website+Link"&gt;secure website&lt;/a&gt;.

Additional support is provided by Phi Theta Kappa and the American Association of Community Colleges. Each team member received a $2,500 scholarship, furnished by Follett Higher Education Group, and was featured in &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/08/phi-theta-all-usa-academic-team/7380319/"&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/a&gt; newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/First-Pierce-Scholar-Named"&gt;Michelle Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/Former-AACC-President-and-Board-Vice-Chair-Remembered"&gt;Dr. David Pierce&lt;/a&gt; online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is focused on long-term financial stability for Phi Theta Kappa. It is dependent upon the generosity of individuals, organizations, foundations and corporations to ensure its future through the support of existing and the establishment of new endowment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

     <title>Have a Five Star Summer!</title>

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-06-03T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Tuesday, June 3, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As your chapter officer team meets this summer, be sure to check your status in the Five Star Chapter Plan to make sure your chapter is on its way to meeting its goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Star Chapter Plan puts the mission of Phi Theta Kappa into action through five levels of engagement progressing from local, campus involvement to regional and international involvement. A breakdown of the Five Star Chapter Plan can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/resources/chapter-leaders-guide"&gt;Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Five Star Plan is a barometer for Phi Theta Kappa that measures the engagement of our chapters,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;Participation at every level of the Five Star Plan is critical to fulfilling our mission, which is why we encourage all chapters to participate at the level that fits them best each year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your chapter wants to reach higher than One Star, update your goal by clicking on the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Report Your Progress&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; button and choosing a different goal. Many activities that an active chapter already does &amp;mdash; setting a membership recruitment goal, submitting a Chapter Annual Report, holding at least two chapter meetings a month and communicating with chapter members through a newsletter, Facebook or other means &amp;mdash; count toward your progress in the plan. Be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;report your progress&lt;/a&gt; regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success includes a suggested timeline aimed at helping your chapter complete its goal. You can also find requirements for each level &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar/requirements"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some activities your chapter can do this summer to maintain its momentum. Please note that these are only suggested summer activities &amp;mdash; many of these activities can be completed at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapters holding a recruitment campaign, submitting the chapter annual report, and having bylaws on file with Headquarters will be recognized as One Star Chapters.&amp;nbsp; Don&amp;rsquo;t miss an opportunity for your chapter to be recognized as a Star Chapter!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the Five Star Chapter Plan requirements and &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar/report"&gt;set a Five Star goal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare to conduct a fall membership recruitment campaign and &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/pam/open-your-enrollment-period"&gt;open a second enrollment period&lt;/a&gt; in PAM in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/pam/chapter-management/chapter-officer-reporting"&gt;Report new officers&lt;/a&gt; for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verify on the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/resources/chapter-directory"&gt;chapter directory&lt;/a&gt; that the college president, chapter administrator and chapter advisor information is current, and &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/contact" title="help"&gt;report any changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a structured orientation for new officers, advisors and committee chairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have your chapter and/or chapter officers meet twice each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your chapter advisor(s) and chapter president each have the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/get-involved/honors-in-action"&gt;2014/2015 Honors Program Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set research objectives and goals and investigate a theme of the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/get-involved/honors-in-action"&gt;Honors Study Topic,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Frontiers and the Spirit of Exploration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have your chapter advisor(s) and officers meet with the college president or other administrator to develop and discuss the chapter&amp;rsquo;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread the word about your chapter&amp;rsquo;s meetings and activities through a chapter newsletter, website or Facebook page or with articles published in a college publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start preparing now for your Honors in Action Project and College Project activities (if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronicle chapter activities for historical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If available, attend a regional event this summer. Or, find another way to engage with others in your region. Check your region&amp;rsquo;s information at &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/regions"&gt;ptk.org/regions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attending Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/honors/institute"&gt;Honors Institute,&lt;/a&gt; June 16-21 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, is one way your chapter can participate at the international level. So if you have a member going this year, be sure to let us know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your chapter was unable to send a representative NerdNation 2014 or to Honors Institute, the requirement to participate at the international level can be met if all chapter officers participate in &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/competitive-edge"&gt;Competitive Edge,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.collegefish.org"&gt;CollegeFish.org,&lt;/a&gt; and view three recorded Convention or Honors Institute speakers presentations (available at &lt;a href="https://my.ptk.org/edge/my/"&gt;my.ptk.org&lt;/a&gt;), and if the chapter completes the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/honors/casechall"&gt;Honors Case Study Challenge&lt;/a&gt; (winners receive $500). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update your chapter&amp;rsquo;s activities regularly at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ptk.org/fivestar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Working 40 hours per week at a wholesale diamond company each day and as a waitress on weekends, she attended college classes at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Goldszmidt served as secretary for the Model United Nations Club and as president of her Phi Theta Kappa Chapter. She hopes to earn advanced degrees in political science and become an advocate of positive change on the national and international levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Many of our students come from low-income families, broken homes and some live in homeless shelters,&amp;rdquo; Goldszmidt explained. &amp;ldquo;I feel it is my personal duty to do everything I can to help them graduate and support them through the transfer process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Students who apply for Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Guistwhite Scholarship are automatically considered for the GEICO Pathway to Completion Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree Scholarship.

She serves as youth band director for her church and volunteers as a mentor for local middle school and high school students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In addition to working as a counselor and welcome center employee at the YMCA, Vandervort serves as a student ambassador at Paradise Valley Community College and president of her Phi Theta Kappa Chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;She sees her life&amp;rsquo;s successes as bridges, leading from one road to another, and challenges, such as suffering from asthma and financial struggles, as &amp;ldquo;potholes that are just dips in the road of life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;GEICO Pathways to Completion Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree Scholarships&lt;/a&gt; are presented by GEICO (Government Employees Insurance Company) to Phi Theta Kappa members who have held a significant leadership position on campus or in their community, with preference given to those who have held a Phi Theta Kappa office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;A sponsor of the Phi Theta Kappa Annual Convention, &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/geico"&gt;GEICO&lt;/a&gt; has given more than $1 million to support scholarships and programs for Phi Theta Kappa members. GEICO is a member of the Berkshire Hathaway family of companies and is the third-largest private passenger auto insurance company in the United States, serving more than 12 million private passenger customers and insuring more than 18 million vehicles (auto and cycle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

     <title>Continue Your Phi Theta Kappa Experience in an Alumni Association</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/join-an-alumni-association 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-05-30T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Friday, May 30, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you prepare to leave your two-year college behind, make sure you keep Phi Theta Kappa with you by joining an alumni association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Alumni%20pic.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Alumni%20pic.jpg?itok=gNlxSf18" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaron Neely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alumni associations can be tied to a specific four-year college or to a specific region, chapter or college. Regardless, they serve as venues for committed Phi Theta Kappa members to continue networking with other like-minded individuals and serving the Society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Kitty%20Spires.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Kitty%20Spires.jpg?itok=mrsVCyDc" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitty Spires&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our alumni and alumni associations are invaluable to Phi Theta Kappa, its advisors and especially its members,&amp;rdquo; said Courtney Taylor, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Giving and Alumni Relations Coordinator. &amp;ldquo;The work they do to support our chapters and members has a tremendous effect on the success of the students and chapters on a local, regional and international level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alumni associations often volunteer for local, regional and international events, allowing chapter members to focus on the programming and to network with others. They provide workshops for their local chapters and act as mentors for chapter officer teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on a more personal level, alumni associations &amp;mdash; especially those associated with a four-year college &amp;mdash; serve as a ready-made network of friends as well as a support group for Phi Theta Kappa members who long to stay connected with others like them, said Mary Kohls, advisor to the Alpha Gamma Pi Chapter at Austin Community College in Texas, which has a local alumni association.&amp;nbsp; The Alpha Gamma Pi Alumni Association was among three associations named outstanding in 2014.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I joined an alumni association because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to leave Phi Theta Kappa yet,&amp;rdquo; said Aaron Neely, the Vice President of Alumni Relations for the Kansas Region and an alumnus of the Eta Gamma Chapter at Coffeyville Community College. &amp;ldquo;This organization has given me so much and has been such an integral part of my life. Phi Theta Kappa gave me opportunities that I would otherwise not have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neely, now a student at Kansas State University, has served as a campaign manager for an International President candidate at NerdNation 2014 in Orlando, Florida; an induction speaker for various Phi Theta Kappa chapters across Kansas; and as a liaison between chapter advisors and officer teams both locally and regionally. He has worked with community college presidents to increase college completion, and he has represented the Kansas Region at local, regional and international events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neely received a 2014 Alumni Award of Appreciation during NerdNation 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An organization is only as strong as the impression it makes,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Alumni dedication shows members and potential members the impact that Phi Theta Kappa has had on their life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to give back to Phi Theta Kappa and its members is just one reason alumni associations exist. Many alumni associations offer scholarships to pay membership fees. Others raise money to support existing scholarship programs, such as the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Without the help of alumni, some students might not be able to join Phi Theta Kappa, some might not get to finish their college education, and some chapters/regions might not be able to get the help they need to be successful,&amp;rdquo; said Hannah Kilpatrick, past president of the Phi Theta Kappa Alumni Association at Athens State University (ASU) in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASU Alumni Association offers Golden Opportunity Scholarships to assist chapters in the Alabama and Tennessee Regions in defraying the cost of Phi Theta Kappa membership. The group received a 2014 Alumni Award of Merit during NerdNation 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alumni associations also encourage member engagement in Phi Theta Kappa programs. Members serve as role models for two-year college students and work to instill the importance of degree completion and academic excellence. They also promote an engaged citizenship in communities, transfer universities and the international Society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We can offer advice and stories of experience to eager new chapters or even to chapters who just want some insight,&amp;rdquo; said Brooklyn McCarley, incoming president of the ASU Alumni Association. &amp;ldquo;In addition, they offer a continued venue for leadership.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Gamma Pi Alumni Association at Austin Community College in Texas conducts workshops with both its local chapter and the Texas Region on such topics as &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa 101,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Running for Office&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Improving Your Phi Theta Kappa Experience.&amp;rdquo; Before presenting, many associations are asked to conduct training with Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also raises funds for various regional scholarships and offers Golden Opportunities Scholarships to potential Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being a part of an alumni association allows us to help with our chapter,&amp;rdquo; said Katherine Petsche, president of the Alpha Gamma Pi Alumni Association. &amp;ldquo;Doing something as small as handing out ice cream bars during an ice cream social at a regional meeting allows host chapters more time to socialize and participate in events.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And alumni associations aren&amp;rsquo;t only for members. Kitty Spires, an alumna of the Alpha Eta Kappa Chapter at Midlands Technical College, returned to the college as a professor and began serving as the chapter advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I joined the Carolinas Alumni Association as a model to the students in my chapter,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;By doing that, I felt students would feel the importance of continuing their association and their service with Phi Theta Kappa.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remaining active and engaged in Phi Theta Kappa initiatives allows members to take on a &amp;ldquo;strategic servant leadership role,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Kim LaFevor, advisor to the ASU Alumni Association. They&amp;rsquo;re there for the chapters when they need support; and, they&amp;rsquo;re able to provide working knowledge of Society programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Individuals like to be a part of success, and the aim of Phi Theta Kappa is all about success and excellence in scholarship, fellowship, leadership and service,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It is more than a membership; it can be a very rewarding life-long experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about joining an alumni association visit &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/alumni"&gt;ptk.org/alumni&lt;/a&gt; or email the Alumni Advisory Council members at &lt;a href="mailto:aac@ptk.org"&gt;aac@ptk.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Chapters Raise Over $76,000 for American Cancer Society</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/chapters-raise-money-for-acs 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-05-29T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, May 29, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer diagnoses of two faculty members, one staff member and two students at Eastern Maine Community College led the Beta Beta Omicron Chapter to start a fundraising campaign for the American Cancer Society. The result? More than $15,000 collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/acs_pic.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/acs_pic.jpg?itok=YRgUCaQT" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa members present the American Cancer Society with a check for more than $3.6 million during NerdNation 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So many of us have been touched by cancer, &amp;ldquo; said chapter advisor Kim Campbell. &amp;ldquo;Therefore, we decided to host a Relay For Life event on our campus. We felt it was a way to give back, to help just a little, in our own way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Relay_Top10_Chapters_2014Conv.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Relay_Top10_Chapters_2014Conv.jpg?itok=MNqCrSxB" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Top 10 fundraising chapters of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campbell saw participation as having a two-fold purpose: the chapter would be educating the college and community while raising money for a worthy cause; and chapter members would gain the knowledge and the leadership and organizational skills that come with planning a large-scale event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beta Beta Omicron Chapter was the top fundraising Phi Theta Kappa chapter for the American Cancer Society in 2013. Bake sales, raffles and a bingo night contributed to the chapter&amp;rsquo;s success. The chapter also had 15 teams and almost 200 participants in its campus&amp;rsquo; Relay For Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2013 Top 10 fundraising chapters raised more than $76,000 for the American Cancer Society. Since 2002, Phi Theta Kappa chapters have raised more than $3.6 million for the American Cancer Society. It is a partnership that has exceeded expectations in terms of chapter involvement and community impact, and it is the longest and most robust partnership that the nonprofit has had with a member-based organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are so impressed with the level of continued commitment Phi Theta Kappa members invest in our fight against cancer and are inspired by their enthusiasm and genuine philanthropy,&amp;rdquo; said Kristen Solt, Vice President of the Hope Lodge Network with the American Cancer Society. &amp;ldquo;There is a spirit of service within Phi Theta Kappa, and the American Cancer Society is honored to count Phi Theta Kappa as a true partner in our work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That spirit is vital to tackling the problem of cancer, and Phi Theta Kappa members, as ACS ambassadors and leaders in their communities, enhance and extend the fight in hometowns across the country and the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alpha Rho Gamma Chapter at Washington State Community College in Ohio raised more than $10,500 through community-wide events such as spaghetti dinners, craft fairs and bake sales. Chapter members also raise money individually &amp;mdash; one raised over $500 on Facebook alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Making the Relay For Life the signature event for our chapter has brought our chapter closer together,&amp;rdquo; said advisor Brad Merritt. &amp;ldquo;Moreover, it provides a bonding experience for our chapter leaders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this partnership does indeed go both ways. The American Cancer Society sponsors Educational Forums during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are incredibly grateful to partner with the American Cancer Society,&amp;rdquo; said Courtney Taylor, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Giving and Alumni Relations Coordinator. &amp;ldquo;The support they provide allows our members to learn how to be better global citizens.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer touches millions of lives each year. According to the American Cancer Society&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Cancer Facts and Figures 2014,&amp;quot; more than 1.6 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed this year. Cancer is expected to kill almost 1,600 a day this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that more people are surviving cancer, thanks to progress in diagnosing certain cancers earlier and to improvements in treatments. According to the ACS, the five-year relative survival rate for all cancers diagnosed between 2003 and 2009 is 68 percent, up from 49 percent in 1975-1977.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participation in American Cancer Society fundraising events has more than tripled since the Alpha Nu Omega Chapter at Harrisburg-Area Community College-Lancaster campus in Pennsylvania founded a Relay For Life team in 2011. In 2013, the chapter raised more than $9,000 for the ACS through community nights at local restaurants, prom dress sales and other similar events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think our membership has grown in its acceptance and understanding of social problems in our area and in areas beyond our immediate reach,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer St. Pierre, Alpha Nu Omega chapter advisor and founding Relay team advisor (Lancaster Campus). &amp;ldquo;We have received support from numerous members of the faculty and staff and have been touched by stories of loss and triumph included in our membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Each year we are growing and having a greater impact at our college, on our campuses and in our communities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Shoemaker, one of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s executive board members and a cancer survivor, expressed interest in forming a campus-based Relay For Life team at the Lancaster campus in 2011. Just two years later, the event had grown to include four of the college&amp;rsquo;s campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Helping with Relay For Life was a valuable exercise in giving of our chapter&amp;rsquo;s time and efforts, both to the college community and to the wider world,&amp;rdquo; said Cathy Itnyre, co-advisor of the Beta Rho Pi Chapter at Copper Mountain College in California, which raised nearly $7,400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Beta Rho Pi Chapter assists with fundraising efforts for the college&amp;rsquo;s Relay For Life team &amp;mdash; Team CMC &amp;mdash; by holding events such as bake sales. Chapter President Eva Chavez said continuing with the fundraising will be a priority for the chapter again this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The close partnership with Team CMC will remain an important factor for our chapter in the future,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Our college is participating in Relay For Life annually, and our chapter always does its best to help raise as many funds for cancer research as possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Has your chapter participated in a Relay For Life event? &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/get-involved/relay-for-life/report"&gt;Tell us about it!&lt;/a&gt; The reporting deadline is September 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-05-29T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, May 29, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Rod Risley, Executive Director and CEO of Phi Theta Kappa, served as commencement speaker at five ceremonies this spring, the common themes were clear &amp;ndash; all over the U.S., community college graduations symbolized new beginnings, second chances and that the American Dream is alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Risley%20-%20Pref%20%282%29.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Risley%20-%20Pref%20%282%29.jpg?itok=WLB0V2Xf" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rod Risley delivers the commencement address at Northeast Community College in Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/TauMuweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/TauMuweb.jpg?itok=mGCcPJOs" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Risley is pictured with Tau Mu officers and advisors, Jayde Lynn Scott, Taylor Murray, Jena Freese, Kristi Peters, Dr. Jack Oden and Vicente Cortez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/BishopStatewcredit.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/BishopStatewcredit.jpg?itok=g9miS6eT" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Bishop State Community College&amp;#39;s commencement Dr. Risley tells graduates that completion matters. (Photo courtesy of Mike Brantley)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Bishop State Community College&amp;rsquo;s commencement held in Alabama on May 7, Risley told the story of Phi Theta Kappa member Breanea Loveless. Finding herself a single mother at the age of 14, she refused to become a victim and instead enrolled in classes and worked at two jobs to support her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am proud to share that the University of South Alabama has awarded Breanea a full-tuition scholarship to study electrical engineering,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Well done Breanea. I congratulate all of the students here today for completing what they started.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the commencement at Bishop State Community College&lt;a href="http://blog.al.com/live/2014/05/graduation_2014_bishop_state_c_1.html"&gt; online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 8 Risley addressed the graduates of Enterprise State Community College, also in Alabama, explaining that he sometimes became frustrated by what we, as a society, seem to value and not value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We value professional athletes more than our instructors. We value being entertained more than we do learning,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;We value buying more things rather than providing more for those in need. We value knowing what people are doing to each other rather than for each other.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I feel ours is a society and a culture that promotes mediocrity,&amp;rdquo; Risley told the graduates, &amp;ldquo;Make this a community where being smart is valued. It&amp;rsquo;s cool to be smart. Don&amp;rsquo;t you ever apologize for that!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited data that revealed in less than four years, two-thirds of jobs in the United States will require a post-secondary degree or credential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley also celebrated the graduates, who often complete despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shared the story of Phi Theta Kappa member Vicente Cortez, who was home-schooled and completed his GED at Enterprise State. He served as president of his Phi Theta Kappa chapter, leading Tau Mu to Five-Star status, all the while caring for his chronically ill mother and working part-time on the weekends -- using tip-money to pay for his tuition. Cortez was honored as Alabama&amp;rsquo;s New Century Scholar and one of 20 members of the prestigious All-USA Community College Academic Team, receiving nearly $5,000 in scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jack Oden, who served as advisor of the Tau Mu Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa for 25 years, served as Honorary Marshall for the commencement. While in Enterprise Risley also had lunch with incoming and outgoing Tau Mu officers, alumna and current advisor Kristi Peters, and Oden, who led the chapter to the Most Distinguished Chapter title twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commencement ceremony for Northeast Community College in Nebraska was held in the college gymnasium that seated 2,500, with 500 guests seated in a separate room to watch a live camera feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The college president told me as we were about to enter the gym that ticket scalping was taking place &amp;ndash; with family members anxious to witness the event firsthand,&amp;rdquo; Risley said, &amp;ldquo;While I don&amp;rsquo;t endorse scalping, how cool is it that family members wanted so much to be in the room where a commencement was to take place?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He praised the perseverance of graduates to complete their degrees and certificates, noting they are the exception to the rule and the answer to the needs of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nationally only 15-25 percent of students enrolled in community colleges earn their credential or degree within six years,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;The United States has fallen from number one among the 34 industrialized economies in the world with the highest percentage of its citizens with a higher education credential to number 16.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to President Barack Obama&amp;rsquo;s call to action to increase credentialing rates, Phi Theta Kappa developed the Community College Completion Corps, which champions the cause of college completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the commencement at Scott Community College in Iowa on May 21, Risley attended a brunch celebration for faculty and staff at which the Phi Theta Kappa chapter was recognized for winning a College Project Award during NerdNation 2014, the Society&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record number of students received degrees during the commencement, with Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s chapter president, Amanda Sue Peterlin, who also serves as Iowa Regional Vice President, speaking on behalf of the class. She received nearly a full scholarship, including a Phi Theta Kappa scholarship, to study art education at Augustana College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa members decked in stoles and medallions were asked to stand and be recognized at the ceremony, which Regional Coordinator Sima Dabir also attended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley told graduates that the gift of an education they received had &amp;ldquo;strings attached.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A true scholar doesn&amp;rsquo;t merely acquire or receive, but gives,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It is not enough to know or possess knowledge. Each of you has a responsibility to share your knowledge acquired here so that all might know. You must improve the quality of life for those who cannot help themselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the Scott Community College commencement in &lt;a href="http://www.qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?id=682097."&gt;local news coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the rural communities where the Alabama, Nebraska and Iowa commencements took place, on May 22 Risley addressed an audience of 3,000 at the graduation held for Hudson County Community College at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in downtown Newark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa member Diana Angelo received a standing ovation after giving the valedictorian address on behalf of the student body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve had students from every race, every country...We&amp;#39;ve had single mothers, we&amp;#39;ve had people in the military. Many of us are the first in our families (to graduate college),&amp;quot; Angelo said. &amp;quot;Reaching the top means something different to everyone, but I know we all got there. I want you to remember what you accomplished here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley told the story of member Maritza Beniques, a native of Puerto Rico. With two children, one of whom will be graduating from HCCC in May 2015, Maritza dedicated most of her adult life to providing for them. Until 2010, she worked at various jobs and would be offered promotions over the years that she could not accept because she did not meet the requirement of having a college degree. After losing her job in 2010, Maritza found it nearly impossible to obtain work. She enrolled at HCCC with the goal of becoming a registered nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Through several scholarships and help from family members, Maritza was able to make it through and complete her degree. The thought of becoming the first of her mother&amp;#39;s children to graduate from college motivated her through the toughest times,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Maritza has been accepted to the New Jersey City University bachelor of science in nursing program, and plans to attend in the fall.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Risley advised graduates that there has never been a better time to be a community college graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ivy League schools across this country are aggressively recruiting these community college students,&amp;rdquo; he told the audience. &amp;ldquo;Because we now have the data to say that if you give these people a seat at the table at a selected senior college, they will perform as well, if not better, than students who attended that senior institution exclusively.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley noted that Pell Grant recipients from the college were transferring to Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Rutgers and the University of California, Berkley. Following commencement he observed that 80 percent of the students at Hudson County Community College were the recipients of Pell Grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They are so hungry for opportunity, for recognition and for someone to believe in them and guide them,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;They are not victims, they are not &amp;lsquo;takers.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is just a small example of how providing resources and access to college can build a better country for all of us.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See full coverage of the Hudson Community College commencement &lt;a href="http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/05/over_900_graduates_receive_diplomas_at_hudson_county_community_college_commencement.html"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, and view &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudsonccc"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; from the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risley added that the 2014 commencement season comes at a time when completion matters more than ever before. Students who complete their degrees or certificates will earn an average of $500,000 more over the course of their careers than their peers who did not complete. In addition, individuals with credentials are less likely to become unemployed than their co-workers who did not earn credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Community College Completion Corps at the Society&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.cccompletioncorps.org"&gt;C4 website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He is planning to go to Northwestern University and hopes to work in both the public and private sectors: at the Caterpillar, Inc. Headquarters in Peoria, Illinois, and as a business consultant for non-profit start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trevor has served as a Student Trustee on the Illinois Central College Board for two years and was recently elected for a third term. He has been named the college&amp;rsquo;s Student of the Year, and upon graduation will begin an internship at Caterpillar, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the classroom, he volunteers as a youth wrestling coach and works as a math tutor. His hobbies include breakdancing, running, studying and frequenting local coffee spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ivette Piña&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Vice President, Division IV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivette is a member of the Alpha Eta Delta Chapter at South Mountain Community College in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivette is a Criminal Justice major.

Each scholar received a commemorative medallion in addition to the funds to complete their proposed projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/marshall"&gt;Jo Marshall Leadership Award&lt;/a&gt; (Marshall Award) is named in honor of Somerset Community College President Dr. Jo Marshall of Kentucky.

In addition to serving as Leadership Development Certification Program Facilitator, Dr. Marshall is also Vice Chair of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation Board of Trustees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Marshall Award was created to encourage the professional growth of Phi Theta Kappa advisors by providing a $5,000 stipend for the completion of a project that leads to personal leadership growth beyond the completion of professional degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Underwood-Smith received the Marshall Award for her proposal, &amp;ldquo;Leadership Dialogues: Building Better Communities Through Family Discourse in the British Virgin Islands.&amp;rdquo; The stipend will allow her, through a series of dialogues and experiential exercises held on Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Jost Van Dyke, to expose parents and their teens to concepts of ethical and servant leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/mosal"&gt;Mosal Awards&lt;/a&gt;, named for the Society&amp;#39;s late Executive Director Emeritus, Dr. Margaret Mosal, are presented to faculty advisors with at least five years of service who have submitted project proposals. Only outstanding, well-reasoned and intellectually substantive proposals are selected by a panel of scholars for funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. West was selected as a Mosal Scholar for her proposal &amp;ldquo;Contested Realities: The Rhetorical Constructions of Antebellum Perspectives,&amp;rdquo; which will allow her to recreate in a documentary film the rhetorical worls of Ohio farmer Garrett Sharp and North Carolina farmer Albert Ingle, two men who lived 500 miles apart in the tense decade preceeding the American Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Nichols received the Mosal Scholarship for her proposal, &amp;ldquo;An Autobiographical Case Study of Nature vs. Nurture Through the Eyes of an Adoptee,&amp;rdquo; which will allow her to research her biological parents and, through that journey, garner information about the roles nature and nurture play in human development. She will share what she learns with her Human Growth and Development students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

     <title>Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Makes a $10 Million Investment in 71 Members</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/71-named-jack-kent-cooke-scholars 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-05-15T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, May 15, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lori King-Nelson and her family have struggled financially since she began attending classes as a non-traditional student at Tarrant County College&amp;rsquo;s South Campus in Texas. But as a recipient of the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://blog.jkcf.org/welcome-to-the-jack-kent-cooke-foundation-blog/media-release-foundation-awards-85-undergraduate-transfer-scholarships"&gt;2014 Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship,&lt;/a&gt; she can stop worrying for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/JKCF%20Logo%202c%20CMYK%20Sml.jpg.jpeg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/JKCF%20Logo%202c%20CMYK%20Sml.jpg.jpeg?itok=7y33fmXD" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To know that things are going to be okay over the next few years while I finish my degree is pretty overwhelming,&amp;rdquo; King-Nelson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Lori%20King-Nelson.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Lori%20King-Nelson.jpg?itok=oexmyhKw" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lori King-Nelson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-one Phi Theta Kappa members are among the 85 two-year college students named 2014 Jack Kent Cooke Scholars by the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest private scholarship program. Historically, a vast majority of Jack Kent Cooke Scholars are also Society members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Dennis%20Murphy.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Dennis%20Murphy.jpg?itok=Dtc7P55B" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis Murphy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment the Foundation is making in these Phi Theta Kappa members has the potential to reach nearly $10 million. Each student will receive a scholarship worth up to $30,000 a year for up to three years &amp;mdash; up to $90,000 total &amp;mdash; to complete his or her undergraduate degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Foundation offers up to $50,000 each to scholars upon the completion of their baccalaureate degree if they meet renewal criteria and continue enrollment for a master&amp;rsquo;s degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I always wanted to go as high as I could go in my education; but until recently, that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a reality,&amp;rdquo; said Dennis Murphy, a 2014 Jack Kent Cooke Scholar from Middlesex Community College in Massachusetts and a Phi Theta Kappa chapter officer. &amp;ldquo;This award gives me the opportunity to achieve the education I want and achieve my dreams. It&amp;rsquo;s opening doors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley said the investment being made in Society members and in two-year college students across the country by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation is vital if students are to complete college and realize their full potential. It&amp;rsquo;s an example he would like to see more organizations follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, only about 12 percent of two-year college students who express interest in earning a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree actually reach that goal. Many students are deterred by the high price of four-year colleges, the limited options for transfer students and a lack of knowledge about the possible academic pathways, the foundation has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is why partnerships providing varied sources of stackable scholarships matter,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;The 2014 Jack Kent Cooke Scholars are eligible to receive up to $140,000 each, if they take full advantage of the offerings available through the program. But some of these students may still find themselves in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While we are extremely grateful for the commitment that the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation has made to our two-year college students, more foundations and organizations must invest in our nation&amp;rsquo;s students. It&amp;rsquo;s not only an investment that will benefit the students; it&amp;rsquo;s an investment that will benefit us all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship is the largest private scholarship for two-year and community college transfer students in the country. Scholars are selected based on high academic ability and achievements, persistence, leadership and financial need. The average GPA of the 2014 Scholars is 3.98, and they come from families with an average adjusted gross income of approximately $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s recipients represent the largest group in the program&amp;rsquo;s 13-year history, with 85 finalists selected from 3,705 applications representing 737 two-year colleges from 48 states, two U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Jack Kent Cooke Foundation has long been committed to helping outstanding community college students transfer to and succeed at the nation&amp;rsquo;s top colleges and universities,&amp;rdquo; said Emily Froimson, Vice President of Programs at the Foundation. &amp;ldquo;Since the program started in 2002, the Foundation has supported 643 community college students directly, and thousands more through the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s grant-making initiatives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past Undergraduate Transfer Scholars have attended such prestigious colleges as Amherst College, Columbia University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Stanford University, Wellesley College and Yale University. Among the 2013 Scholars, 62 percent were first-generation college students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Phi Theta Kappa members often make up a large percentage of the recipients each year, Society membership is not required for this award. Phi Theta Kappa Foundation CEO Dr. Nancy Rieves said that while the program is rigorous and highly competitive, Phi Theta Kappa members seem to have a competitive edge over other applicants because of the Society&amp;rsquo;s emphasis for its members to develop as leaders, achieve academic success and engage thoughtfully in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Students who engage in Phi Theta Kappa programs gain immeasurably from the experience and are recognized for their achievements by prestigious scholarship providers like the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation,&amp;rdquo; Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Consistently, the majority of scholarship recipients are engaged Phi Theta Kappa members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We value the strong working relationship that Phi Theta Kappa has for many years shared with the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation in providing our members access to selective senior colleges.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application cycle for the 2015 Undergraduate Transfer Scholarship Program will be open from late September to early December 2014. Rising sophomores and those who have graduated from two-year colleges within the last five years but who have not yet enrolled at a four-year college are encouraged to apply for this scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sites/default/files/docs/news/14_JKC Scholar List.docx"&gt;View all 71 Phi Theta Kappa members that have been named 2014 Jack Kent Cooke Scholars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jkcf.org"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Instructor Certification Seminars Go Beyond Leadership</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/seminars-go-beyond-leadership 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-05-14T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, May 14, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a mathematics professor, Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisor Chris Bush was intimidated by a leadership development program grounded in the humanities. Still, she wanted to bring the program to her campus at Palm Beach State College in Florida, so she attended a Leadership Instructor Certification Seminar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It made for a busy three-day weekend, as the seminar was being offered as an option to Faculty Scholars during their annual conference at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Center for Excellence in Jackson, Mississippi. Bush still gets excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It totally opened my world,&amp;rdquo; said Bush, who has served as an advisor for 15 years and a Faculty Scholar twice. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve become a better instructor because of my re-introduction to the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d been so ensconced in math for the last 40 years that it was nice to expand my knowledge. The other side of my brain was working.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/leadership-development"&gt;Leadership Development Program&lt;/a&gt; is a nationally recognized program that integrates writings from the humanities &amp;mdash; the Great Books and other historical and literary works &amp;mdash; as well as film studies and exercises into a facilitated learning environment. Students are encouraged to apply these humanities as sources of wisdom to their own organizations, creating critical thinkers and problem solvers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who wish to teach the leadership curriculum on their campus or in their organization must first attend a Leadership Instructor Certification Seminar. But even those who never plan to teach the course can benefit from the seminar, as more than 2,700 educators from over 700 institutions already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The experience and the variety of approaches to leadership and personal development came together to give me one of the best professional development experiences I have ever had,&amp;rdquo; said Richard Georges, co-advisor to the Beta Omicron Sigma Chapter at H. Lavity Stoutt Community College in the British Virgin Islands. &amp;ldquo;The same tools I hope the course develops in my students are the ones I have developed by participating (in the seminar), and I utilize them on a daily basis as a professional who has to operate as part of a team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georges has served as an advisor for eight years and a Faculty Scholar twice. He is also the Immediate Past Chair of the Association of Chapter Advisors. He attended a Leadership Instructor Certification Seminar in 2010 and co-teaches the course offered at his college, which is open to everyone who has completed the Composition II course and is a program requirement for all Humanities students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Actually attending the certification seminar was an incredible experience and heavily influenced my instruction of the course,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It really drives home the idea that this is an experiential learning course and that the students have as much to bring to the classroom as the instructor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond the classroom, many advisors have integrated the leadership program into their chapters through officer training, particularly sections on teamwork, servant leadership and ethical leadership. As a result, chapter officers know how to articulate ideas and gain the support of other chapter members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This course is invaluable as a tool for chapter development,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Fritts, co-advisor of the Alpha Psi Tau Chapter at Ozarks Technical Community College in Missouri. Fritts is the lead instructor of American Sign Language and serves as the Associate Regional Coordinator for the Missouri Region. &amp;ldquo;We have used it on the regional level for teambuilding and for breakout sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You will hear our students quote the text and the principles learned in the course and see evidence of behaviors that were directly impacted by the material.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three days, the Leadership Instructor Certification Seminar goes unit-by-unit through the new, fifth edition of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s leadership textbook, &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/fifth-edition-leadership-textbook-available"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Leadership Development Studies: A Humanities Approach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The curriculum employs five distinct, high-impact teaching methodologies proven effective in leadership development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendees learn how to facilitate leadership dialogues; observe and practice facilitation techniques; increase awareness of their own personal philosophy of leadership; and hear about best practices for implementation at institutions around the world. Seminar enrollment isn&amp;rsquo;t limited to Phi Theta Kappa advisors; student affairs professionals, honors faculty members and anyone else interested in leadership development are encouraged to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Leadership Development Certification Seminar is the single most impactful personal and professional development event I have experienced in my career,&amp;rdquo; Fritts said. &amp;ldquo;It opened doors to personal insights that I may never have stumbled upon on my own. It was exhausting yet exhilarating, emotional yet logical, and life-changing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Leadership Instructor Certification Seminars have been scheduled for 2014:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;May 15-18, Lewis Center, Ohio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;July 10-13, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania (Early Registration Deadline: May 22)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;July 17-20, Long Beach, California (Early Registration Deadline: May 29)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early registration rate is $1,650 and includes tuition, certification and instructor materials, single-occupancy lodging for three nights and meals for the duration of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It will change your life for the better,&amp;rdquo; Bush said. &amp;ldquo;You will be a better person, a better leader and a better teacher because of the program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Or, both may be purchased as a bundle for $70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth edition includes new classic cases, such as excerpts from &lt;em&gt;Les Misérables&lt;/em&gt; and a new play called &lt;em&gt;The Night is Darkest Before the Dawn&lt;/em&gt;. There are also new Leadership Profiles on Brazilian educator and philosopher Paulo Freire, best-selling author Maureen Dowd and the former First Lady of Egypt Jehan Sadat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also new to the edition are 14 contemporary readings and two Film Study options for each of the 11 course units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This curriculum is accessible and relevant to all,&amp;rdquo; Byrd said. &amp;ldquo;These carefully chosen works show the passion, engagement, skill and philosophies of many types of leaders, and the curriculum encourages personal reflection as well as the development of a personal philosophy of leadership.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://bcs.haydenmcneil.com/phithetakappa/default.asp#t_924786____"&gt;Book Companion Website&lt;/a&gt; that includes free, open-access resources such as flashcards and supplemental information about the textbook content. Instructor Resources are also available and include an Instructor&amp;rsquo;s Manual, PowerPoint slide decks for each Unit, Certificates of Recognition for those completing the course, and promotional brochures and posters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The W.K. Kellogg Foundation recognized Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Studies curriculum as one of only eight Exemplary Leadership Development Programs in Higher Education. Courses using the curriculum are taught on college campuses and in businesses across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every single semester, students in the course say they wish the Leadership Development Course was the first one they&amp;rsquo;d taken at college,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Fritts, a Certified Leadership Development Instructor and advisor to the Alpha Psi Tau Chapter at Ozarks Technical Community College in Missouri. &amp;ldquo;It would have completely changed the way they interacted in classes, on group projects and with their instructors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have heard story after story of students who have taken the course and found their passion and their voice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The textbook is required for those participating in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa.leadership?ref=hl"&gt;Leadership Development Study Group on Facebook,&lt;/a&gt; a nine-week non-credit study group that explores key topics related to leadership. The group is open to members, alumni and non-members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparation to adopt the text is provided in &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/docs/leadership/2014LeadershipCertBrochure.pdf"&gt;Leadership Instructor Certification Seminars,&lt;/a&gt; aimed at those who wish to be able to teach the curriculum. Three seminars are scheduled for 2014:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;May 15-18, Lewis Center, Ohio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;July 10-13, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;July 17-20, Long Beach, California&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Chartered in 2013, this was the chapter&amp;rsquo;s first opportunity to send representatives to a Phi Theta Kappa international event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation announced in 2013 that the Society would honor the memory of long-time staff member West Williamson by establishing the West Williamson Convention Scholarship Endowment, which will provide annual scholarships for an advisor and member from a newly-chartered chapter to attend the Annual Convention of Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Williamson was currently serving as Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s project manager for information technology at the time of his death on June 25, 2013, at the age of 45, having served Phi Theta Kappa for 23 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;He began his career with the Center for Excellence as a part-time staff member while attending Holmes Community College, where he earned membership in Phi Theta Kappa. Williamson transferred to Delta State University on a Society scholarship, graduated, and returned to work with the organization full time. He served in many key leadership roles &amp;ndash; including information technology, membership services, and chapter programs. Phi Theta Kappa was the only organization with which Williamson worked during professional career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The West Williamson convention scholarship afforded the Beta Upsilon Xi chapter with a marvelous opportunity to be exposed to the entire Phi Theta Kappa community,&amp;rdquo; said chapter advisor Khalid Holmes. &amp;ldquo;The information gained will increase our ability to become a successful chapter as well as progressive members of our campus community and that of the world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Nancy Rieves, CEO of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, said creating and naming the scholarship for Williamson was a way to honor his great contributions to the Society over 23 years as an alumnus and staff member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;West touched the lives of both students and advisors, and knew the importance of early engagement of chapters,&amp;quot; Rieves said. &amp;quot;Fittingly, he was responsible for chartering chapters and the launch of convention scholarships for advisors given each year. Encouraging newly chartered chapters to attend the Annual Convention increases their chance of active participation in the full &amp;rsquo;Phi Theta Kappa Experience&amp;rsquo; for years to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Anyone wishing to make a donation to the Williamson Scholarship Endowment in memory of Williamson may do so by visiting the &lt;a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/ptkfoundation"&gt;Foundation website&lt;/a&gt;, mailing a check to the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation office at 1625 Eastover Drive, Jackson, MS 39211 with the memo line marked West Williamson Scholarship, or by phoning the Foundation with a credit card payment at 601.987.5507.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

All Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisors are automatically members of the ACA, which meets annually during NerdNation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACA officers assist in planning the program for the annual ACA meeting and may be called upon to serve on various committees and act as facilitators for advisor enrichment. The officers are also asked to give feedback to the Headquarters staff on a variety of Society issues and programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each ACA officer serves a four-year term beginning with Secretary then advancing to Vice Chair, Chair and Immediate Past Chair. All four divisions of Phi Theta Kappa are represented on the officer team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schroeder has served as a Phi Theta Kappa advisor for 13 years. He is a member of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Honors Program Council and has served as a Faculty Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engagement with the Society has afforded Schroeder a wealth of professional development opportunities. He has taken many of the activities, strategies and improvements learned at Phi Theta Kappa events and incorporated them into the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In an age where college budget constraints put increased limits on the possibilities of exploring professional development, it is refreshing to see the emphasis that Phi Theta Kappa puts on enriching the experience of the advisor,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/get-involved/alumni-advisory-council"&gt;Alumni Advisory Council (AAC)&lt;/a&gt; support chapter leadership and membership by providing mentorship, guidance and education. They support chapter and member involvement in Honors in Action programming; they increase financial support of local and Society-wide scholarships for members; and they facilitate quarterly networking opportunities for alumni and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason is an alumna of the Alpha Delta Chapter at Hopkinsville Community College in Kentucky. She previously served as both a chapter and a regional officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been named an Outstanding Chapter Officer as well as an Outstanding Chapter President, and she has received Outstanding Chapter Service and Leadership Awards. Mason has also received numerous regional awards, including the Regional Shining Star Award. And, she has received the Alumni Award of Appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-04-15T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Tuesday, April 15, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca (Becky) Allen and Stephen (Steve) Schroeder have each served as Phi Theta Kappa chapter advisors for 13 years. They have each engaged with the Society in numerous ways both regionally and internationally throughout their years as advisors. And both have been nominated to represent Division III as Secretary of the Association of Chapter Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/allen_rebecca.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/allen_rebecca.jpg?itok=I9TbVSzn" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca &amp;quot;Becky&amp;quot; Allen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All advisors attending NerdNation 2014, April 24-26 in Orlando, Florida, will vote for Secretary. The winner will be announced during the Hallmark Awards Gala Saturday, April 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/schroeder_stephen.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/schroeder_stephen.jpg?itok=6UNIUzpZ" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen &amp;quot;Steve&amp;quot; Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, all votes will be cast online. When voting opens, each advisor attending NerdNation 2014 will receive an email from Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief of Staff Deidra Daws, &lt;a href="mailto:deira.a.daws@ptk.org"&gt;deidra.a.daws@ptk.org&lt;/a&gt;, containing a link to the online voting system. Emails will be sent to the advisor&amp;rsquo;s address on file with Headquarters. Polling opens at 3:00 p.m. Wednesday, April 23, and closes at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, April 26.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advisors without email access through a personal mobile device may use one of the iPad stations at the Voter Registration Booth near NerdNation Registration to access email and cast their votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Voter Registration Booth will be open at the following times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wednesday, April 23: 1:00 - 10:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thursday, April 24: 7:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Friday, April 25: 7:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Saturday, April 26: 9:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becky Allen is advisor of the Alpha Rho Tau Chapter at Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana. She served as a facilitator for the 2013 Phi Theta Kappa Academy and co-presented an Educational Forum. She will do the same at NerdNation 2014, and she is a 2014 Faculty Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My involvement with Phi Theta Kappa has given me the opportunity to meet new people and develop lifelong friendships,&amp;rdquo; Allen said. &amp;ldquo;Professionally, I have developed stronger leadership skills as I work with the students and outside organizations. I am also more civic-minded and tend to volunteer more than I did before.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene Spiess, then-Indiana Regional Coordinator, asked Allen to serve as a Phi Theta Kappa advisor. As an administrator on campus, she had heard of the organization but had little knowledge about what it actually was. She attended a regional conference on Spiess&amp;rsquo; invitation and was captivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was touched by the excitement of the students and the advisors and knew immediately that I wanted to be a part of the organization,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa creates opportunities that allow students to grow beyond what they thought possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen has seen both students and advisors benefit from Phi Theta Kappa involvement over the years. Membership in the Society gives students a sense of belonging &amp;mdash; sometimes for the first time in their lives &amp;mdash; and keeps them encouraged to do their best, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And advisors are able to reach beyond their current roles with the college and work with students on campus while developing personal strengths and skills as leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Advisors serve as mentors, guides and sometimes the &amp;lsquo;voice inside their head&amp;rsquo; that members need to successfully complete goals,&amp;rdquo; Allen said. &amp;ldquo;When students succeed, we feel successful too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Schroeder is co-advisor to the Phi Theta Chapter at the College of DuPage in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. He is a member of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Honors Program Council and has served as a Faculty Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schroeder&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Phi Theta Kappa began when he was asked to cover for an advisor who was on maternity leave and take the chapter to a regional convention. He was immediately hooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The positive energy and enthusiasm demonstrated by the students combined with the mission and purpose of the organization illustrated through their events were like nothing I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen,&amp;rdquo; he said. When he was asked to replace a retiring advisor the following year, he leapt at the chance. &amp;ldquo;It was one of the best professional decisions I ever made.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engagement with the Society has afforded Schroeder a wealth of professional development opportunities. He has taken many of the activities, strategies and improvements learned at Phi Theta Kappa events and incorporated them into the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In an age where college budget constraints put increased limits on the possibilities of exploring professional development, it is refreshing to see the emphasis that Phi Theta Kappa puts on enriching the experience of the advisor,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Schroeder acknowledges that most students become Phi Theta Kappa members for the scholarship benefits, he urges them to become more involved with the Society to develop skills that will both benefit them in a variety of professional and personal situations and further qualify them for the scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By giving academic achievers the opportunity to directly influence their campus and community, they can begin to see the tremendous impact they can have throughout their future professional and personal lives, leading to lasting, positive influences,&amp;rdquo; Schroeder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/aca-candidates"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about Becky Allen and Steve Schroeder and the voting process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-04-11T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Friday, April 11, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right round"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Speech Transcripts&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sites/default/files/docs/news/michelle_davis_speech.pdf" title="Davis Speech" class="pdf"&gt;Michelle Davis' Speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/sites/default/files/docs/news/ncs_troxel_speech.pdf" title="Jessica Troxel Speech" class="pdf"&gt;Jessica Troxel's Speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dropping out of high school. Being a single parent to two sons. Losing your home and belongings in a flood. Losing your arm in a car accident. Any one of these things would be reason enough for some people to postpone &amp;mdash; or even stop altogether &amp;mdash; the pursuit of a higher education. Jessica Troxel faced them all, and in May she will graduate Magna Cum Laude from Ivy Tech Community College-Bloomington in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/photo%201.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/photo%201.JPG?itok=dbJyXs1q" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Century Scholar Jessica Troxel with Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel is also the New Century Scholar for Indiana. She recently spoke on behalf of the other scholars to college administrators and higher education leaders during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Presidents Breakfast, hosted during the annual conference of the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) in Washington, D.C., April 5-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/DSC02526.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/DSC02526.JPG?itok=H6MkkSzN" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated, from left: Michelle Davis; Beau Davis; James Gagnon, USA TODAY National Sales Manager; and Courtney Taylor, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Annual Giving/Alumni Relations Coordinator. Standing, from left: Dr. Cary Israel, President of Collin College; Heather Johnson, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Director of Scholarship Programs; Dr. Rod Risley, Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO; Dr. Nancy Rieves, Phi Theta Kappa Foundation Executive Director and CEO; and Debra West Risley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Honestly, all of the opportunities, awards and recognition make no sense to me in my mind,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m not doing astounding things; I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m being a mom, a student, a girlfriend, a member of my community &amp;mdash; a human. That&amp;rsquo;s all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel is one of 51 community college students from the United States, Canada and American Samoa named a &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/2014-New-Century-Scholars-Announced"&gt;Coca-Cola New Century Scholar.&lt;/a&gt; These scholars are the highest-scoring students from each state on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Fall Common Scholarship Application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each scholar receives a $2,000 scholarship. The program is sponsored by the Coca-Cola Foundation, the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation, Phi Theta Kappa and the AACC. More than 1,700 students from more than 900 community colleges were nominated for this honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My favorite part about it is that it is a wonderful demonstration to my two sons, Zach and Taylor, of what it means to work hard and be rewarded for it,&amp;rdquo; Troxel said. &amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The New Century Scholar does not just look at academics, but also involvement on campus as well as in the community. I want to inspire them!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel is a single mother of two sons. She dropped out of high school and admits that she didn&amp;rsquo;t always make good choices. Still, with the encouragement of her boss, she got her GED when she was 27 and enrolled at Ivy Tech in 2008. Soon after though, her home was flooded. And three months later, she lost her arm in a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later, in August 2009, she returned to Ivy Tech and began classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I felt it was important to pick up the pieces and be the role model I always wanted to be for my two young children, so I did,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;There is good in every bad situation, and I needed to find my silver lining.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel received an invitation to become a member of Phi Theta Kappa after her first semester, but the cost of membership and a general lack of knowledge about the Society kept her from accepting. When she finally did become a member in the spring of 2013, it was only because of the scholarships offered and because she&amp;rsquo;d heard it would look good on her resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What I did not know was the abundance of opportunity it held,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;The cost of membership means nothing compared to the scholarships and opportunities it has provided.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she is an officer in her Phi Theta Kappa chapter. She also recently became a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) for her county, which is a volunteer position as an officer of the juvenile court. She is majoring in Social Work and was recently able to travel with her college to Guatemala for a service learning course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troxel will also be traveling as an International Scholar Laureate nominee to Australia and New Zealand under the Delegation on International Business and Entrepreneurship May 24-June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No matter what life throws at you, you can dream, achieve and inspire,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Somewhere along the way, I found hope and courage; I found hope and courage in others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Davis also addressed higher education leaders during the Closing Plenary Brunch, also held during the recent AACC convention. Davis is a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/2014-All-USA-Team-Awarded-Scholarships"&gt;2014 All-USA Community College Academic Team&lt;/a&gt; and was asked to speak on behalf of the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is sponsored by Follett Higher Education Group and presented by USA TODAY, with additional support from the AACC and Phi Theta Kappa. Twenty scholarships of $2,500 each are awarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is also the first recipient of a scholarship established in memory of &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/First-Pierce-Scholar-Named"&gt;Dr. David Pierce,&lt;/a&gt; former AACC President and Phi Theta Kappa Board of Directors Vice Chair. Davis is a business major at Collin College in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being named a member of the All-USA Academic Team is such a great honor,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;It is evidence that my service, dedication and accomplishments are acknowledged and appreciated, and all my hard work paid off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis was born in the United States but grew up in Brazil. She dropped out of college and returned to the U.S. to work. She then got married and became a stay-at-home mom to two children. In 2011, though, she enrolled at Collin College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is president of her Phi Theta Kappa chapter; president and team captain of the Political Science Club and Mock Trial Team; and a senator in the Student Government Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being part of Phi Theta Kappa is without a doubt the highlight of my journey through school,&amp;rdquo; Davis said. &amp;ldquo;While developing my leadership skills, I made lifetime friendships with like-minded individuals and served my college, my peers and my community through a breadth of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Participating in Phi Theta Kappa programs constantly reminds me that, as I serve others, I receive much more than I give, which is the true power of service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Set Your New Five Star Goal</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/set-new-5-star-goal 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-04-10T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Thursday, April 10, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to hit the reset button. You can now set a new goal for your chapter in the Five Star Chapter Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Star Plan puts the mission of Phi Theta Kappa into action through five levels of engagement that progress from local, campus involvement to regional and international involvement. A breakdown of the Five Star Chapter Plan can be found in the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/docs/chapter/2014%20Chapter%20Leader's%20Guide.pdf"&gt;Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guide includes a suggested timeline aimed at helping you complete your goal. All chapters should have received a copy of the guide at the beginning of 2014. New chapter advisors and presidents also will receive this helpful tool as they are reported to Headquarters throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Five Star Plan is a barometer for Phi Theta Kappa that measures the engagement of our chapters,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;Participation at every level of the Five Star Plan is critical to fulfilling our mission, which is why we encourage all chapters to participate at the level that fits them best each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every chapter begins anew every calendar year, allowing chapters to have a fresh start and a challenging goal year after year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some activities you can do now to get your Five Star goal off to a good start. Please note that this timeline is only a suggestion; many of these activities can be completed at any time. Be sure to report your progress regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set a membership recruitment goal for each induction in 2014. Advisors &amp;mdash; open the winter/spring PAM enrollment period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct an induction ceremony. Provide information about chapter activities and the benefits of engaging in them, and encourage new members to run for chapter leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is often a good time to meet with the college president or other administrator to discuss chapter goals and involvement on campus; begin dialogue about a possible College Project; share experiences at regional and international events and any recognition received; and discuss plans and needs for the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late spring is often when chapters have officer elections for the next summer, fall and spring semesters; new officers should begin by reviewing the chapter bylaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advisors: please report all newly elected chapter officers in PAM. Chapter Leaders: verify the Chapter Directory information at &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/chapter-directory"&gt;ptk.org/chapter-directory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the word out about meetings and activities with a chapter newsletter, website, and/or published articles in a college publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep a complete chronicle of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Begin Honors in Action Project planning. Learn more on page 11 of the Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success and at &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/honors"&gt;ptk.org/honors.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring means Regional Conventions, and attendance at a regional event and engaging with the region is a Four Star requirement. Check your region&amp;rsquo;s information at &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/regions"&gt;ptk.org/regions.&lt;/a&gt; Check for summer and fall events too and plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will your chapter engage with the region?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Campaign for regional office&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the regional Honors in Action Project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Host or help lead a regional event&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with at least two other chapters in the region for an activity or event&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Star:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Academy and Convention on April 24-26, 2014, in Orlando, Florida, is one of the options to fulfill the Five Star requirement to participate at the international level.

     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-04-08T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Tuesday, April 8, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jackson, MS - The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation has announced that the Society will honor the memory of former President of the American Association of Community Colleges and Phi Theta Kappa Board Vice Chair Dr. David R. Pierce with the establishment of a scholarship in his name. The $1,000 scholarship will be presented annually to the student chosen to represent the All-USA Community College Academic Team by speaking during the Closing Plenary Brunch at the AACC annual convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/michelle%20davisweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/michelle%20davisweb.jpg?itok=lgsPLYkD" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014 Pierce Scholar Michelle Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/news/Former-AACC-President-and-Board-Vice-Chair-Remembered"&gt;Dr. Pierce&lt;/a&gt; served as president of AACC from 1991-2000 and as a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Board of Directors for 11 years, serving as Vice-Chair from 2001-2003. He provided extraordinary leadership to both organizations and was respected by his peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Upon his death in early 2014, the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation wanted to establish a scholarship in his memory with the donations received in his honor. Maureen Pierce, his wife, and his family requested that the scholarship be awarded to a community college student. The first David R. Pierce Scholarship will be awarded during this year&amp;rsquo;s AACC Annual Convention on April 8 in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 1991, Phi Theta Kappa introduced the inaugural All-USA Community College Team at AACC during the Society&amp;#39;s Presidents Breakfast. Dr. Pierce, then president of AACC, requested that Phi Theta Kappa continue to recognize the All-USA Team each year at AACC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is fitting that the David R. Pierce Scholarship be presented to the scholar selected each year from the All-USA Community College Academic Team to represent and speak on behalf of the scholars at AACC&amp;#39;s Annual Convention,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Nancy Rieves, CEO of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation. &amp;ldquo;As a former president of AACC, it seems appropriate to remember Dr. Pierce among his peers and the scholars of the nation&amp;rsquo;s community colleges.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The All-USA program is widely recognized as the most prestigious academic honor for students attending community college. Nominees are hand-selected by college presidents or their designated nominator for demonstrating academic rigor, leadership and civic growth. The program also recognizes students who extend their community college education to better themselves, their schools and their surrounding communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 All-USA Community College Academic Team is sponsored by Follett Higher Education Group and presented by USA TODAY. Additional support is provided by Phi Theta Kappa and the American Association of Community Colleges. Each team member will receive a $2,500 scholarship, furnished by Follett Higher Education Group, and be featured in USA TODAY newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;All-USA Community College Academic Team member Michelle Davis, a business major at Collin College in Texas, was selected as the first recipient of the David R. Pierce Scholarship of $1,000 for completion of an associate degree. She hopes to earn a baccalaureate degree and become a tax accountant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in the U.S., Davis grew up in Brazil amid financial hardship, but her academic abilities surfaced early. After being given a scholarship to attend a private school at the age of 14, she walked three miles to school each day and sold her homemade cookies at recess to help her family at home. Not able to afford books, Davis studied at the library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mother who has fought tirelessly for her children, Davis has maintained a 4.0 grade point average while overcoming a language barrier. A leader in her Phi Theta Kappa chapter, Davis volunteers for projects she feels will exemplify her community.&amp;nbsp;Her instructors describe her as a confident student, who has the humility to allow people to connect with her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every difficulty I faced was an opportunity to build my character, giving me an appreciation for education,&amp;rdquo; Davis said. &amp;ldquo;Excelling in school was my way of taking advantage of the opportunities I was given. With little money to pay forward the generosity I have received, I spent my time in the service of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;M&lt;span id="cke_bm_310S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_309S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_308S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_307S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_306S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;y past is the road that led me to where I am. As I look back, I see no obstacle too high to climb, no difficulty too big to overcome, and no goal too far to reach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is focused on long-term financial stability for Phi Theta Kappa. It is dependent upon the generosity of individuals, organizations, foundations and corporations to ensure its future through the support of existing and the establishment of new endowment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For more information on how to contribute to the David R. Pierce Scholarship fund or other scholarships for Phi Theta Kappa members through the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, contact Philanthropy Coordinator Karri Chaney at &lt;a href="mailto:karri.chaney@ptk.org"&gt;karri.chaney@ptk.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span class="skype_c2c_print_container"&gt;601.987.5507&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="skype_c2c_container" dir="ltr" onmouseout="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(event)" onmouseover="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)" skype_menu_props="{&amp;quot;numberToCall&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;+16019875507&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;isFreecall&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;isMobile&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;isRtl&amp;quot;:false}" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;span class="skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common" dir="ltr" skypeaction="skype_dropdown"&gt;&lt;span class="skype_c2c_textarea_span"&gt;&lt;span class="skype_c2c_text_span"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;or give online at the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/ptkfoundation"&gt;secure website&lt;/a&gt;.

They displayed eight large banners bearing thousands of signatures of others on their campuses who have &amp;ldquo;committed to complete.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Regional%20Officers%20with%20Rod%20Stevenweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Regional%20Officers%20with%20Rod%20Stevenweb.jpg?itok=xFcjsLGK" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictured at the Capitol are Dr. Rod Risley, Minn-Kota Regional Officers Heather Fast, Regina Taillefer and Yeng Xiong, along with Chancellor Steven J.

Rosenstone of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, Minnesota Commissioner of Higher Education Larry Pogemiller, and State Auditor Rebecca Otto.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The occasion was part of an international effort promoted by Phi Theta Kappa, C4 (&lt;a href="http://www.cccompletioncorps.org/"&gt;Community College Completion Corps&lt;/a&gt;). The theme for Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s event was &amp;ldquo;Plant the Seeds for a Secure Future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Minnesota is one of many states putting the spotlight on college completion, an issue that strongly impacts the world&amp;rsquo;s economy. Recently C4 events have been held in New Jersey, Delaware, Iowa, Colorado and Michigan, with more being planned in Mississippi, Texas and Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Students, faculty and college presidents gathered at the campus of St. Paul College, where Otto exhorted the students to share their completion stories with the legislators and encourage their support of the state&amp;#39;s two-year colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The group walked from the campus to the State Capitol for a rally and press conference, where Rosenstone and Pogemiller addressed the gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Rosenstone commended Phi Theta Kappa, the students and faculty for raising awareness of the need to complete a credential or degree, adding that the C4 completion effort reflected his agenda of making Minnesota more competitive economically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;quot;The state has committed to providing new money for scholarships and grants to our citizens in order to ensure access to higher education and develop the essential skills that will keep Minnesota competitive in a global economy,&amp;rdquo; Rosenstone said. He presented his signed C4 Completion Champion card to Phi Theta Kappa Regional Coordinator Jon Wood, expressing his personal commitment to help all students finish what they start.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Risley commended the efforts of Rosenstone and Pogemiller in their attempt to increase the number of the high school graduates who are college-ready by beginning assessment of students as early as their sophomore year. &amp;rdquo;The goal should be to eliminate the need for the developmental education of high school graduates completely by ensuring students are prepared to succeed when entering college,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Division III International Vice President Rachel Reeck, who attended the event along with Minn-Kota regional officers, said it was inspirational to see the Capitol&amp;rsquo;s rotunda filled with banners of signatures promising completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The purpose of the C4 event was to create awareness of the immense need for students to commit to complete their degrees,&amp;rdquo; said Heather Fast, Vice President for the North District of the Minn-Kota Region and President of the Riverland College chapter. &amp;ldquo;It was comforting to hear our leaders in education support our efforts and encourage us to become leaders in the initiative, pushing Minnesota&amp;#39;s lawmakers to continue on the path toward supporting growth in our state through education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I look forward to working with them in the future to develop more leaders in our Phi Theta Kappa chapters who will carry on the legacy of great education in our state.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeng Xiong, Minn-Kota Regional Historian/Secretary and Co-President of the Phi Theta Kappa Chapter at Century College, said it was a wonderful experience to be inside the state capitol, seeing legislators face to face and being able to share personal stories to make a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our local legislators were able to see first-hand the impact that their decisions have on us, as students. We were able to let our voices be heard.&amp;rdquo; Xiong said. &amp;ldquo;We stressed the importance of committing to completing our education to our legislators and showed them that we as Phi Theta Kappans are taking a step toward a positive future with our C4 initiative.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For more photos and complete coverage of Minnesota&amp;rsquo;s Complete the Dream event, visit &lt;a href="http://kstp.com/article/stories/S3382192.shtml?cat=12695"&gt;ABC Channel 5 Eyewitness News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

Each year $100,000 in scholarship funds are awarded, with each Guistwhite Scholar receiving a $5,000 scholarship for baccalaureate studies and a commemorative medallion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guistwhite Scholars are chosen based on academic achievement, leadership accomplishment and engagement in Phi Theta Kappa programs. The 20 recipients for 2014 were selected by a panel of independent judges from more than 1,700 applicants to receive this scholarship, the second highest offered by Phi Theta Kappa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;The Guistwhite Scholarship Program&lt;/a&gt; is named in honor of the late Dr. Jack Guistwhite and his widow, Margaret Guistwhite.

Risley. &amp;ldquo;It is fitting that we continue to honor our students who excel in scholarship and leadership in Phi Theta Kappa as Guistwhite Scholars in memory of Jack and in honor of his wife Margaret. Through their generosity and those who support scholarships through the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, these students will receive funds to help them complete their degrees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The 2014 Guistwhite Scholars are:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilliam Acosta, Collin College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayla Duchaine, Eastern Florida State College, Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah Griffin, Northeast Texas Community College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Jordan, Northeast Texas Community College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Kemeny, Mesa Community College, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aline Kraus, Central Arizona College, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyu Hee Lee, Northern Virginia Community College, Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urbano Lino, Tyler Junior College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keari Little, SUNY Mohawk Valley Community College, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Loffert, Allegany College of Maryland, Maryland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sofia Medina, Essex County College, New Jersey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks Mitchell, Darton State College, Georgia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tina Nguyen, Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, Mississippi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maureen Njuguna, Mt.

     <title>College Presidents Take Lead to Meet Oberndorf Scholarship Challenge </title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/College-Presidents-Take-Lead-to-Meet-Oberndorf%20Challenge 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-03-24T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Monday, March 24, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Jackson, MS &amp;ndash; When Phi Theta Kappa partnered with the Oberndorf Family Foundation to endow a scholarship program for community college scholars in danger of dropping out due to financial difficulties, Foundation Trustee Dr. E. Ann McGee thought college presidents should take the lead in making the endowment a reality. And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/McGee_students_small%20%282%29web.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/McGee_students_small%20%282%29web.jpg?itok=slUZl_64" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_309S" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phi Theta Kappa members Juan Robayo and Crystal Williams are pictured with Dr. E. Ann McGee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_309E" style="display: none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/oberndorf"&gt;Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; helps Phi Theta Kappa members overcome unanticipated financial barriers preventing the completion of the first college credential, an associate degree or certificate, while enrolled in the two-year college. This scholarship was created through a collaborative effort between benefactors Rosemary and Lou Oberndorf, the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation and the 2011-2012 International Officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2011, the Oberndorf Family Foundation challenged the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation to raise $125,000 in order to receive a one-to-one challenge grant. When it was announced that the challenge was met at the 2012 Annual Convention, the Oberndorfs challenged the Foundation to raise another $125,000, which they matched one-to-one, resulting in a total $500,000 endowment for the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. McGee, a Phi Theta Kappa alumna and president of Seminole College in Florida, challenged her fellow college presidents to raise $50,000 among themselves to help the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation reach the goal to receive matching funds from the Oberndorf Family Foundation and complete the endowment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Together college presidents and leaders of organizations like the American Association of Community Colleges, the Association of Community College Trustees, the Community College League of California and the Texas Association of Community Colleges raised more than $52,000 for the Oberndorf Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;What motivates college presidents and chancellors each and every day are the examples of student success that we are privileged to experience first-hand,&amp;rdquo; Dr. McGee said. &amp;ldquo;The outpouring of financial support from them &amp;mdash; and from such agencies as AACC and ACCT &amp;mdash; simply reinforces the recognition of the financial barriers that exist for our students and the desire to help.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Dr. Cindy L. Miles, chancellor of the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District in California says she has seen students facing tremendous challenges on their road to college completion, including being homeless, living without running water and having to walk seven to 10 miles to attend school. They are the reasons she supports Phi Theta Kappa and its Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having worked for four colleges with Phi Theta Kappa chapters, I know its power as a campus touchstone for student engagement and for helping students stay in college and meet their goals,&amp;rdquo; Miles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For Alicia Diggs, an accounting major at Northeast Texas Community College, the Oberndorf Scholarship was truly a lifeline. She maintained a 3.9 grade point average while helping her 13-year-old son fight ossifying fibroma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many hours driving back and forth to doctors and tons of money on travel and medical expenses,&amp;rdquo; Diggs said. &amp;ldquo;But I feel life is like a deck of cards you are dealt. My cards haven&amp;rsquo;t been the greatest, but I play them to the best of my ability for my children and myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;With the help of the Oberndorf Scholarship, Diggs is on track to graduate in May. &amp;ldquo;I am excited to finish my degree and start a new career and life with my children,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I want to set an example for them that they can achieve their dreams through hard work, drive and being dependable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Foundation CEO Dr. Nancy Rieves said she was proud that community college leaders had stepped forward in overwhelming support of the Oberndorf Challenge to help students like Alicia. &amp;ldquo;We are so thankful to these individuals and organizations, and to Dr. McGee for taking the lead in this initiative,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Together with students, advisors and alumni, college administrators made this scholarship endowment possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation is grateful to the following community college leaders and all those who donated to the Oberndorf Challenge:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Jeffery Allbritten&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. David Armstrong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Kenneth Atwater&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. William Austin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Daniel Bain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Cynthia S.

But, two key things happened for it in early 2013: Dr. Kelly Kennedy became the new chapter advisor, and Jeffrey Romeu became chapter president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/0_IMG_6493.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/0_IMG_6493.jpg?itok=K7unmD-5" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Beta Pi Theta Chapter at Miami Dade College-Hialeah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Kennedy and Romeu are competitive, and they both enjoy a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I like to see organizations grow; I like the challenge,&amp;rdquo; Romeu said. &amp;ldquo;And, the objective of Phi Theta Kappa is such a good objective. I saw a lot of potential there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romeu was inducted in 2012 and was one of only about four active members. The prior chapter president encouraged the now-21-year-old to seek a leadership position within the chapter. As he became president, Kennedy came on board as advisor. She had previously been one of five advisors at Miami Dade College&amp;rsquo;s North Campus chapter; and, upon relocating to the Hialeah campus, she had been hoping to get more involved with the chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We just dove right into it,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said. &amp;ldquo;Now we&amp;rsquo;re up to around 160 members.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter started by working with college administrators to send out an email to all eligible members. Then, a follow-up email was sent containing a passcode so the student could accept membership online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The best things we ever did were allowing students to accept online and to pay with a credit card,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hialeah campus is small, with only one main academic building, so there aren&amp;rsquo;t as many eligible students as there would be at other larger colleges and campuses. It&amp;rsquo;s also located in a poorer neighborhood, which means many eligible students do not accept their membership invitation simply because they cannot pay the fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these two hurdles, the true game-changer in the chapter&amp;rsquo;s membership numbers proved to be good, old-fashioned promotion of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We put posters on every floor of the buildings on campus,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said. &amp;ldquo;We set up a Facebook page. We had faculty members promote it in their classroom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter also garnered about 800 signatures during a Commit to Complete event, lending further visibility to the chapter. And, the chapter displayed the results of its Honors in Action Project in the campus library, which also generated buzz and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have to have a special group of kids, which I know we all do,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romeu is among that special group of kids. He&amp;rsquo;s a first-generation college student who is also president of the Student Government Association. Kennedy swears he will rule the world someday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romeu was recently selected to work in the U.S. Department of State as an intern for two years, one in Washington, D.C., and the second in a foreign country in an embassy or consulate office. He was one of only 18 students chosen from more than 15,000 applicants across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Serving as chapter president and being in Phi Theta Kappa has taught me a lot about team building, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to delegate,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;And through our community service projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned even more that it&amp;rsquo;s not all about me. It&amp;rsquo;s about the difference we can make in the lives of others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quick growth of the chapter &amp;mdash; their promotional efforts were seeing results in as little as two months &amp;mdash; led to the creation of an eight-member officer team known as the Executive Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a very surreal year,&amp;rdquo; Romeu said. &amp;ldquo;It will be amazing to look back and see what all we accomplished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those accomplishments is the jump to a Four Star Chapter. Kennedy said the chapter is hoping to ultimately be named a Five Star Chapter for its efforts in 2013 and said they are just waiting to hear from Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters that they&amp;rsquo;ve reached that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter also completed an Honors in Action Project and participated in the Honors Case Study Challenge. They attended their first regional meeting in early 2013, and they are finalizing plans to attend their first Annual Convention in Orlando in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter has begun holding events with chapters from the other Miami Dade College campuses, and they all support each other&amp;rsquo;s fundraisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fellowship is one of the most important things,&amp;rdquo; Kennedy said. &amp;ldquo;If the students like the things we&amp;rsquo;re doing, they&amp;rsquo;ll want to do even more, and it makes others want to join.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

More than 1,700 students were nominated from more than 900 community colleges for recognition. Judges consider grades, leadership, activities and, most importantly, how students extend their intellectual talents beyond the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;New Century Scholars are the highest-scoring students in each state, plus one student from Canada and one additional student chosen from among one of the remaining seven sovereign nations where Phi Theta Kappa is represented internationally. Each scholar will receive a $2,000 scholarship and be presented at the American Association of College Presidents (AACC) Convention in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We appreciate the support of the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation and the Coca-Cola Foundation to recognize the outstanding academic achievement and leadership accomplishments of these outstanding community college students,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley. &amp;ldquo;These scholarships provided by organizations like Coca-Cola make the goal of college completion possible &amp;ndash; especially during these challenging economic times.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2014 New Century Scholars are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="default"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Alabama - Vicente Cortez, Enterprise State Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Alaska - Tiffiny San Andres, Ilisagvik College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;American Samoa - Witt Mariner, American Samoa Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Arizona - Jennifer Brady, Mohave Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Arkansas - Patricia Esperon, Arkansas State University Mountain Home&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;California - Sarah Farmer, San Diego Mesa College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Canada - Stefan Florchuk, Medicine Hat College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Colorado - Andrea Seipel, Front Range Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Connecticut - Serena Giacomin, Gateway Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Delaware - Michael Griner, Delaware Technical Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;District of Columbia - Izuchukwu Abel, Community College of the District of Columbia&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Florida - Kayla Duchaine, Eastern Florida State College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Georgia - Brooks Mitchell, Darton State College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hawaii - Edward Bufil, Hawaii Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Idaho - Belinda Reyff, College of Western Idaho&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Illinois - Julie Crafton, Heartland Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Indiana - Jessica Troxel, Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Iowa - Megan Doubleday, Southwestern Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Kansas - William Mims, Dodge City Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Kentucky - Courtney Carpenter, Somerset Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Louisiana - Stephanie Rogers, Delgado Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maine - Jason Glynn, Southern Maine Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Maryland - Hannah Patarini, Howard Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Massachusetts - Heather Hilton, Massasoit Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Michigan - Eric Howard, Muskegon Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Minnesota - Abigail Harding, Vermilion Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mississippi - Zachary Warren, Jones County Junior College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Missouri - Shannon Kreutzer, Cottey College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Montana - Jackcee Idland, Miles Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nebraska - Xavier Shiu, Metropolitan Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nevada - Honey Tapley, Western Nevada College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;New Hampshire - Jane Quigley, NHTI-Concord&amp;rsquo;s Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;New Jersey - Sofia Medina, Essex County College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;New Mexico - Robert Gonzales, Eastern New Mexico University-Ruidoso&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;New York - Laura DeNardo, Jefferson Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;North Carolina - Joseph Burch, Central Piedmont Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;North Dakota - Jayme Pischel, Bismarck State College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ohio - Maksym Gerasimov, Sinclair Community College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Oklahoma - Kelsey Williams, Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;amp;M College&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Oregon - Sule Whitlock, Mt.

     <title>Louisiana Community and Technical College System President Named Distinguished State Director</title>

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-03-19T00:00:00-05:00"&gt;Wednesday, March 19, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, MS &amp;ndash; Dr. Joe May, immediate past president of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System (LCTCS), will be presented with the Distinguished Community College State Director Award&amp;nbsp;during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://convention.ptk.org/"&gt;NerdNation 2014&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando April 24-26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Dr%20May1BWweb.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Dr%20May1BWweb.jpg?itok=PP4JOsas" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joe May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Distinguished Community College State Director Award recognizes the contributions of heads of state community college systems. Recipients demonstrate the state community college director&amp;#39;s support of Phi Theta Kappa chapters, advisors and regional organizations. Dr. May was nominated by the Omega Nu Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa at Delgado Community College in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his nomination for this award, Dr. May accepted the position of Chancellor for the Dallas County Community College District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selected as the President of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System in January 2007, Dr. May provided leadership to 13 colleges that enroll 116,000 students throughout the state. Prior to that role, he served as the President of Pueblo Community College.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first in his family to attend college, Dr. May realized the profound impact that higher education had not only on his life, but on all of society. He is the founding president of Rebuilding America&amp;rsquo;s Middle Class (RAMC), a national consortium of community colleges that is dedicated to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to pursue the American Dream. In 2012, in his role as the president of RAMC, he testified before Congress to share his views on improving operational efficiency while controlling the cost of attending college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. May championed the effort to reprioritize community and technical college offerings that has resulted in Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s two-year college graduates out-earning the graduates of universities by 8.6 percent. During his tenure enrollment increased from 71,000 to more than 160,000 students. With the launch of Work Ready U, he was able to increase by over 49,000 the number of adults receiving the basic literacy education and workforce skills necessary for them to succeed in today&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet the demands of job growth and changing workforce needs, Dr. May led the effort to secure $600 million in funding for over 50 advanced technology centers throughout Louisiana. He has been responsible for crafting and passing over 35 separate pieces of legislation to enhance post-secondary education and workforce training for Louisiana&amp;rsquo;s citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former recipient of the Shirley B. Gordon Award, Dr. May was a strong supporter of the All-Louisiana Community College Academic Team. He also helped establish the All-Colorado team while serving as Director of the Colorado Community College System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A native of East Texas, Dr. May earned his doctorate in education from Texas A&amp;amp;M-Commerce and Master of Education and Bachelor of Science degrees from Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

Register before March 31 for the lowest rate available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Academy program focuses on the powerful role of diversity and inclusivity in Society chapters, on college campuses and in the world. Keynote speakers are award-winning entrepreneur &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/academy/speakers/justin-jones-fosu"&gt;Justin Jones-Fosu&lt;/a&gt; and German Holocaust survivor &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/academy/speakers/inge-auerbacher"&gt;Inge Auerbacher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/educational-forums"&gt;Educational Forums&lt;/a&gt; allow for small-group discussions on topics ranging from Honors in Action &amp;nbsp;and scholarship opportunities to college transfer tips and professional development. Five rounds of forums &amp;mdash; approximately 75 topics in all &amp;mdash; will be presented April 24-26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With more than 3,500 people in the General Sessions, the Ed Forums are where you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to talk in a more intimate setting with the Headquarters staff, other expert presenters and, of course, like-minded Phi Theta Kappa members and advisors,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/experience/mini-sessions"&gt;Marketplace Mini Sessions&lt;/a&gt; are 25-minute discussions on various Phi Theta Kappa topics that often include lively Q&amp;amp;A with the audience. These small-group settings allow members and advisors alike to mingle with their peers, hear about best practices they can use in their own chapters, and broaden their horizons by networking with people from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The impact of these kinds of opportunities extends way beyond lectures and sessions,&amp;rdquo; said Will Alexander, advisor of the Kappa Alpha Chapter at Holmes Community College in Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander recalled one of his favorite stories about the impact an international Phi Theta Kappa event has had on a student: it involves a former member who was given the opportunity to travel as a part of a Phi Theta Kappa trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This particular trip was the student&amp;rsquo;s first opportunity to leave the state of Mississippi, and the student&amp;rsquo;s first opportunity to fly,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;As a result of that trip, the student later became a professional pilot for a major airline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Had it not been for the student&amp;rsquo;s involvement in Phi Theta Kappa and (our college&amp;rsquo;s) commitment to provide our students with the most comprehensive educational experience, the student likely would have never had the opportunity to even consider that as a career.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kappa Alpha Chapter also regularly sends representatives to Honors Institute, a weeklong exploration of the current Honors Study Topic held on the campus of a four-year college. The &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/honors/institute"&gt;2014 Honors Institute&lt;/a&gt; will be June 16-21 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Registration is open now through May 15 and is first-come, first-served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We feel as though our participation in Honors Institute has been a significant contributing factor in our success on the international level,&amp;rdquo; Alexander said. &amp;ldquo;Through its innovative programming, Honors Institute continues to give Kappa Alpha students and advisors an opportunity to dig deeper into the Honors Study Topic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honors Institute is limited to around 500 attendees, giving it a more intimate feel from the start. Students and advisors stay in dormitories and eat in a common dining room, which encourages fellowship and interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there are keynote speakers in each session, the small-group seminar groups that meet throughout the week are the key to making those invaluable connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Honors Institute Experience augments student understanding of learning as multidimensional and not restricted to the classroom,&amp;rdquo; said Rob Carey, advisor to the Alpha Beta Chi Chapter at Pima Community College in Arizona. &amp;ldquo;It helps them comprehend connections between their personal beliefs, values and actions. These opportunities are important because they break down isolationist barriers to intellectual exchange that may exist within their own communities and regions, even if those areas are culturally and ethnically diverse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Selected from nearly 100 applications, the scholars receive scholarships of $500 each to complete their associate degree studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/oberndorf_logo_2.png" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/oberndorf_logo_2.png?itok=Tbh36zNq" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/oberndorf"&gt;Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship&lt;/a&gt; helps Phi Theta Kappa members overcome unanticipated financial barriers preventing the completion of the first college credential, an associate degree or certificate, while enrolled in the two-year college. This scholarship was created through a collaborative effort between benefactors Rosemary and Lou Oberndorf, the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation and the 2011-2012 International Officers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2011 Lou and Rosemary Oberndorf challenged the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation to raise $125,000 in order to receive a one-to-one challenge grant. When it was announced that the challenge was met at the 2012 Annual Convention, the Oberndorfs challenged the Foundation to raise another $125,000 which they matched one-to-one, resulting in a total $500,000 endowment for the Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;quot;We are very grateful to Rosemary and Lou Oberndorf and donors to the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation for meeting the challenge to create an endowment and making these scholarships available to our members,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley. &amp;ldquo;Congratulations to our recipients. Without a doubt the Oberndorf Scholarships will make a tremendous impact on the lives of these hard-working, high-achieving students &amp;mdash; making it possible for them to complete their associate degrees.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Oberndorf Lifeline to Completion Scholarship recipients are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Isabel Rose Babasa, Pima Community College-Downtown Campus, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Ashley&amp;nbsp;Cronin, Washington State Community College, Ohio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Yohanna Diaz, Roxbury Community College, Massachusetts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Alicia Diggs, Northeast Texas Community College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Joie Frontz, Tarrant County College-Northeast Campus, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Merkling, Rainy River Community College, Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Stephen Milburn, Northeast Texas Community College, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Marcus Sands, Northampton Community College, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Heather Venezia, Harrisburg Area Community College-Lancaster Campus, Pennsylvania&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;One Anonymous Recipient&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every Phi Theta Kappa member, advisor, alumnus and administrator has the ability to make a difference for students struggling to complete,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Foundation CEO Dr. Nancy Rieves. &amp;ldquo;We are so grateful to all the donors who are making these dreams of college completion come true.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptkfoundation.org/"&gt;The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is focused on long-term financial stability for Phi Theta Kappa. It is dependent upon the generosity of individuals, organizations, foundations and corporations to ensure its future through the support of existing and the establishment of new endowment funds.

These forums, along with Marketplace Mini Sessions, explore the programs and opportunities unique to the Phi Theta Kappa Experience, as well as career, transfer and professional development themes that enhance student success. There truly is something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educational Forums are led by Society staff members, chapter advisors, members, alumni and partners, four-year college and student development professionals. Their skills are directly related to the forum discussions they are leading, so you know the information you are gaining is solid and sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Participating in the Educational Forums is a must if you want the full NerdNation Experience,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;With more than 3,500 people in the General Sessions, the Ed Forums are where you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to talk in a more intimate setting with the Headquarters staff, other expert presenters and, of course, like-minded Phi Theta Kappa members and advisors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five rounds of Educational Forums will be held:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round 1: Thursday, April 24, 1:30-2:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round 2: Thursday, April 24, 3-4 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round 3: Friday, April 25, 8:30-9:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round 4: Saturday, April 26, 10-11 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round 5: Saturday, April 26, 1:45-2:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 75 forums will be presented during NerdNation 2014. Several are aimed specifically at chapter advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We especially want all advisors to participate in our &amp;lsquo;Important HQ Updates&amp;rsquo; Ed Forum, offered four different times,&amp;rdquo; Stanford said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to hear from us and let us hear from you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2014 Educational Forums feature presentations by some very special guest speakers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crafting Your Story | Round 2 &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;Alumna and Pulitzer Prize-winner Mirta Ojito shares her best advice for storytellers wanting to pursue a career in writing. Find out how she began at Miami Dade and has gone on to publish her second successful book while teaching at the journalism school for one of America&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confronting the Troublemaker in Your Chapter | Round 3 &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;CampusSpeak CEO T.J.

     <title>Strong Chapter Officer Teams Lead to Success</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/strong-chapter-officers-equal-success 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-03-07T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Friday, March 7, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things were going well for the Alpha Rho Mu Chapter at Lone Star College-Tomball in Texas. A new slate of chapter officers had been installed, and there were high hopes for what the fall 2013 semester would bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/TauTheta.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/TauTheta.jpg?itok=nJ5kx2tV" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tau Theta Chapter Officer Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until the contact advisor, Dr. John Rollins, was assigned to serve as Academic Dean of the college&amp;rsquo;s new campus in Indonesia. He would be there for the duration of the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/officer_team.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/officer_team.jpg?itok=GDrSZ37W" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chi Nu Chapter Officer Team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This officer team saved this chapter when I was forced to abandon it,&amp;rdquo; Rollins said. &amp;ldquo;While I appreciated the trust that the college administration placed in me by sending me (literally) halfway around the world, I deeply regretted having to leave them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They contributed to the success of the chapter by drawing on their leadership skills and by coming together even more closely as a team. They were left, for all practical purposes, alone. And they responded beautifully.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A strong chapter officer team is vital to the overall success of a chapter. The officers should work to build an atmosphere of teamwork, promote engagement in Phi Theta Kappa programs among members, and demonstrate strong leadership abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If members see chapter officers having fun while being servant leaders and gaining scholarships, they are more likely to participate in activities,&amp;rdquo; said Tammy Fuentez, advisor to the Tau Theta Chapter at Labette Community College in Kansas. &amp;ldquo;Our team didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ask members to do anything they weren&amp;rsquo;t willing to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labette Community College is a small, commuter-only campus, and the average age of its students is 33. Chapter officers only commit to one semester of leadership to help accommodate their busy schedules; however, Fuentez said she has never had an officer stop mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tau Theta chapter officers set a goal to increase not only membership but also member participation. All chapter officers committed to becoming Five Star Competitive Edge Members, setting the bar for the rest of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s members. The team used a weekly email to keep in close contact with its members, and collection drives for things like pop tabs for the Ronald McDonald House, loose change for St. Jude&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital and Million Meals Kansas, and old cell phones and ink cartridges for Holden&amp;rsquo;s Hope gave members an easy way to participate in chapter activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was a 32 percent increase in chapter membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have been very blessed to have officer teams who understand how to enjoy the fellowship part of working hard on scholarship, leadership and service,&amp;rdquo; Fuentez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A successful chapter officer team doesn&amp;rsquo;t just plan activities for the chapter; they participate as well. They make themselves available for their members, and they keep an open line of communication among their advisors, their members and themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers from the Alpha Zeta Eta Chapter at North Lake College in Texas accomplished this by coordinating their class schedules so that at least two officers were available at some point every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Scheduling their classes the way they did made things so much easier for everyone,&amp;rdquo; said chapter advisor Dr. Yolanda Romero. &amp;ldquo;We had one officer, our Vice President of Membership, who took all online classes so he could be available for the other officers and membership. They are doing the same thing this semester.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When building an effective chapter officer team, Romero looks for students who have &amp;ldquo;compassion, integrity, communication skills and tenacity.&amp;rdquo; At the same time, the officer team must have the support of the chapter advisors &amp;mdash; advisors who spend time with the officer team, communicate with them openly and participate in activities greatly contribute to the success of the officer team, which in turn leads to a more successful chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You cannot have a successful chapter without a strong officer team,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;The membership needs effective leadership that cares about the members and wants to draw them in to participate in chapter activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is not just about the officers, and this need to be transparent to the membership. This is why good communication is important.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chi Nu Chapter from Eastern Florida State College &amp;ndash; Melbourne Campus had tangible results from its Honors in Action Project with which it measured its success: the chapter raised more than $27,000 during its project fundraiser, far-exceeding its goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter held a gala fundraiser to benefit Air Mobile Ministries, which brings water filtration systems to disaster areas and areas where filtered drinking water is in short supply. This was a charity that the officers believed in greatly, which only deepened their commitment to the project. Each officer had a role in the Honors in Action project, and they kept in close contact with each other to ensure that the project stayed on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the chapter blew its $5,000 fundraising goal away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A strong chapter officer team produces events that are hugely successful,&amp;rdquo; said advisor Dr. Mary Roslonowski. &amp;ldquo;I believe the officer team that (co-advisor) Maureen Groome assembled had a shared vision and worked together to achieve that vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If all on the team don&amp;rsquo;t believe in the goal, the project would not be successful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students who serve as chapter officers do so as volunteers. They juggle heavy course loads as honor students and often have to contend with outside obligations such as work, families and community service as well. The students of the Alpha Rho Mu Chapter were no exception, and yet the team of officers took on even more responsibility as their advisor worked in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as Rollins knew they could and would, they got the job done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chiefly, I look for people who will follow through and do what they have promised they will do,&amp;rdquo; Rollins said. &amp;ldquo;Everyone in Phi Theta Kappa is smart, but not everyone follows through. Without this quality, no program can be successful.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He explained that statistics show the surest way for anyone to land a job in their chosen field is to earn a degree or certificate. Those statistics also show completing a degree or certificate program can increase lifetime earnings by up to $500,000 and lead to living a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;A key to increasing community college completion is for the Legislature to enact a statewide articulation agreement between Iowa community colleges and senior colleges,&amp;quot; Dr. Risley said at the Capitol. &amp;quot;College-to-college articulation agreements often are ineffective and poorly administered.&amp;nbsp; A statewide articulation system would ensure that all credits for an associate degree would be accepted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He encouraged policymakers to &amp;ldquo;move away from a philosophy of a right to fail, and support the right to succeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The C4 initiative calls on each Phi Theta Kappa member and all community college students to pledge to complete their own as well as to support another student in the completion of their community college credential.&amp;nbsp;Iowa community college leaders, trustees, administrators, faculty and staff have also taken the C4 pledge to assist students in completing their credentials.&amp;nbsp;Iowa policymakers were also asked to show their support of completion by signing the C4 Banner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In just the past year, all 15 of Iowa&amp;#39;s community colleges, their Phi Theta Kappa chapters, faculty, staff and even non-Phi Theta Kappa students have pledged to support C4,&amp;quot; said Mick Starcevich, Kirkwood Community College President and chair of the Iowa Association of Community College Presidents. &amp;quot;This personal commitment from these helping hands can make all the difference to students given the daily challenges some face. We encourage them to stick with this program, and we promise to never give up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of the legislators also signed the C4 banner indicating their support, including Senate Education Committee Chairman Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, who noted that Iowa State University, where he teaches, already has articulation agreements with each of the 15 community colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is a strong recognition that we need to work together,&amp;rdquo; Quirmbach said. &amp;ldquo;Community colleges are the right start for a lot of students.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Earning a community college certificate or degree is a life-changing event for a student, making a difference in his or her lifetime earnings and quality of life,&amp;quot; said Jerry Smith, Southwestern Community College Trustee and board chair of the Iowa Association of Community College Trustees. &amp;quot;Having worked in job training and placement throughout my entire career, I know the value of education when obtaining employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Those of us who serve on the board of one of Iowa&amp;rsquo;s community colleges share a passion for improving the lives of students. C4 supports this passion by offering a helping hand as a student works toward his or her determined goal, and that in turn, benefits the student, his or her family, and the community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read full coverage of the event at the &lt;a href="http://cccompletioncorps.org/news"&gt;C4 News site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa&amp;rsquo;s Phi Theta Kappa Region was founded in 1999 and this year has nearly 2,800 Community College honor students in Iowa&amp;rsquo;s 15 Community Colleges. Iowa has been recognized by the Society as a Distinguished Region, and Iowa chapters consistently rank among the Top 100 in Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses across the U.S., Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-03-04T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, March 4, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How well do you know Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/benefits/competitive-edge"&gt;Five Star Competitive Edge program?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The 2013-2014 International Officers will host a two-week Competitive Edge Challenge on March 4, 6, 11 and 13 at 8 p.m. CST each night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/CE%20Challenge.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/CE%20Challenge.jpg?itok=vrqZ5Vow" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;First round starts tonight, March 4, at 8 p.m. at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa"&gt;facebook.com/phithetakappa.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Challenge will take place on the Society&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa"&gt;Facebook page.&lt;/a&gt; Act quickly, because a winner will be announced at 10 p.m. that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch videos by each International Officer. Post your answer in the comments section below the Facebook post, and one member with the correct answer will be randomly selected each night to win a $50 credit to the Phi Theta Kappa Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of our goals as an International Officer team is to encourage participation in Competitive Edge,&amp;rdquo; said International President Daniel Chitty, a member of the Alpha Gamma Pi Chapter from Austin Community College in Texas. &amp;ldquo;Competitive Edge is a key resource offered by Phi Theta Kappa to enhance professional development skills, and we want as many members as possible to take advantage of this awesome opportunity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to becoming International President, Chitty served as a regional officer in Texas. Increasing participation in Competitive Edge was a goal of his regional officer team, and the success and positive results of the initiative were so overwhelming that he brought the goal to the international level. Texas was one of the top three regions for participation in Competitive Edge in 2013, along with Florida and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competitive Edge is a self-paced professional development plan available exclusively to Phi Theta Kappa members. It features activities and instructional videos designed to strengthen such marketable skills as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, goal setting, professional etiquette and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, 1,551 Phi Theta Kappa members participated in Competitive Edge, with 515 of them completing Level 5. With employers placing increased importance on soft skills, Chitty and the other International Officers are hoping the Facebook Challenge will inspire even more members to log on to Competitive Edge and start working toward a goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research presented by the National Association of Colleges and Employers in its Job Outlook 2012 Survey listed that the attribute of having held a leadership position held equal influence as a potential hire&amp;#39;s major in whether they would get the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also showed that evidence of teamwork, leadership and written communication skills topped the lists of attributes employers seek on a candidate&amp;#39;s resume. Teamwork skills were rated as the overall most important skills a candidate can have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members have long praised Competitive Edge for the effect it&amp;rsquo;s had on them both personally and professionally. The plan has led students to go from inactive members to engaged leaders in their chapters and on their campuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key component of the plan is that it keeps track of your progress, creating an online portfolio of activities and accomplishments. Members can walk through the steps of putting together a professional resume, which is imperative when applying for scholarships now and jobs later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s designed to help members strengthen marketable skills that are needed no matter what your major or career choice are,&amp;rdquo; said Jennifer Stanford, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer. &amp;ldquo;And, Competitive Edge can help any member build an effective resume of marketable skills &amp;mdash; even those who are not able to actively participate in their chapters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos of many past Annual Convention and Honors Institute speakers are also available for viewing. Other videos include &amp;ldquo;Overcoming Speech Anxiety,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Social Media Etiquette,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Online Job Interviews.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I learned how to communicate with others to set goals, manage conflicts and successfully complete tasks and projects,&amp;rdquo; said John Fernandez, a Five-Star Member and a graduate of St. Petersburg College in Florida. &amp;ldquo;I have had the opportunity to learn how to make formal presentations. I have become a more effective speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have also sharpened my critical thinking skills, which have allowed me to become a better writer and a better person. I have learned to work with all types of leadership and have had the opportunity to teach others to do the same.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need more reasons to start work on the Five Star Competitive Edge Program?

Never submit your first draft. &amp;bull; Organize information with bullets. &amp;bull; This is your one chance in front of the judges &amp;mdash; make a good impression!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have MULTIPLE persons CRITIQUE your application.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double-check your application for COMPLETION. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;An incomplete application is as good as NO application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTOCOPY or PRINT your application before submission. &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;bull; You can use it as a reference. &amp;bull; If it gets lost, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above all, do not miss the deadline!

Keller will receive her award during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/"&gt;Annual Convention&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando, Florida, April 24-26, where she will also serve as keynote speaker at the Gratitude Banquet for Alumni and Friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/keller_joan%20%282%29web.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/keller_joan%20%282%29web.jpg?itok=qfNzMbQN" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joanie Keller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Board of Directors Alumni Achievement Award is presented annually to an alumnus in recognition of his or her service contributions in support of Phi Theta Kappa on the local, regional, national or international levels. Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors established this award to encourage and recognize continued support provided to the Society by outstanding alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s more than 2 million alumni, only 19 have been selected as recipients of this honor,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley. &amp;ldquo;Joanie Keller has served Phi Theta Kappa at every level for more than 30 years, and even though battling cancer recently has been a real challenge for her, she continues to put Phi Theta Kappa first.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Keller was inducted into the Alpha Epsilon Omicron Chapter of Trident Technical College on April 1, 1981. She has served as a chapter advisor, alumni advisor and Regional Coordinator of the Carolinas Region from 1991 to 2001, when she was named Regional Coordinator Emeritus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As an alumna, Joanie has continually given back to the chapters and the region with the same passion she displayed for Phi Theta Kappa as a member, chapter advisor and regional coordinator,&amp;rdquo; said Carolinas Regional Coordinator John Sharpe, who serves as an advisor at Horry-Georgetown Technical College.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;She is a friend and mentor to everyone in Phi Theta Kappa and a consummate servant leader &amp;ndash; encouraging others to strive for more and helping them in their quest to succeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Under Keller&amp;rsquo;s leadership the Alpha Epsilon Omicron Chapter developed a reputation for excellence, from producing International Officers and candidates to being perennially among the top chapters in Hallmark Awards. She has been recognized as a Mosal Scholar and Distinguished Advisor and has served as both a Faculty Scholar and a certified instructor in Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;According to fellow Alpha Epsilon Omicron advisor Dr. Chris Solomon, Keller continues to be actively involved as a leader and mentor for the members, alumni and advisors in the Carolinas Region. As an adjunct professor at Trident Technical College, she is the first to encourage eligible students to accept their membership invitations to Phi Theta Kappa and is frequently seen providing encouragement and advice to members and alumni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Joanie lives and breathes for her students, friends and family,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Solomon said. &amp;ldquo;She not only believes in the four Hallmarks of Phi Theta Kappa, she lives the four Hallmarks of Phi Theta Kappa. She truly has been the wind beneath the wings of hundreds of students.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;A committed alumna, Keller is also a charter member of the Carolinas Region Alumni Association and the chapter-based Gamma of South Carolina Alumni Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Joanie serves as an inspiration to members of the Carolinas Region,&amp;quot; said Beth Boyles Carraway, a former National Officer and advisor to the chapter at Horry-Georgetown Technical College. &amp;quot;She demonstrates continued involvement with Phi Theta Kappa, from serving as an alumni chapter advisor, to being a guest speaker at regional events, to offering advice to those who are struggling. This region wouldn&amp;#39;t be the same without Joanie&amp;#39;s influence!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Before beginning her teaching career, Keller worked as a certified public accountant. After graduating from Trident Technical College, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from the College of Charleston and an MBA from The Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am overwhelmed and humbled by this award. I have always felt that no matter how hard I worked for the organization, I was always getting more out of it,&amp;rdquo; Keller said. &amp;ldquo;I think the sense of scholarly fellowship and the opportunity to use Phi Theta Kappa as an empowerment tool for my students and fellow advisors was what I enjoyed most about the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The network I built, all the professional development, which led to my personal growth &amp;ndash; being involved in Phi Theta Kappa is an amazing journey. And then getting the students involved and watching them grow - I was always telling them to be all that you can be, and Phi Theta Kappa was an amazing conduit in making this happen.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.

There&amp;rsquo;s an intimacy to Honors Institute that, through a limited number of attendees and small seminar group discussions, fosters learning and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Honors Institute is all about student success,&amp;rdquo; said Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs. &amp;ldquo;Our program affords members and advisors the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary inquiry, raise their global awareness, and experience deep learning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Register before May 16 using the &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/honors/institute/register"&gt;new online submission form&lt;/a&gt; to receive the lowest rate of $895 per person. Attendance is limited to approximately 500 people and is filled on a first-come, first-served basis. The registration fee covers lodging in a campus residence hall, dinner Monday evening, all meals on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, and breakfast on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honors Institute is often called the &amp;ldquo;crown jewel&amp;rdquo; of honors programming. It is a special week of intense study of the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/honors-in-action"&gt;2014/2015 Honors Study Topic, &lt;em&gt;Frontiers and the Spirit of Exploration,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can and often does directly impact the success of a chapter. Features of the event include internationally recognized speakers, small group seminars, educational field trips and experiential activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It gives the students the opportunity to grow academically without the stress of a grade,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Mary James, advisor of the Upsilon Eta Chapter from Florida State College at Jacksonville. &amp;ldquo;Since it is an open discussion format, it allows the students the chance to develop a technique to express themselves. I have seen some personal growth in students as well as in myself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Honors Institute speakers are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Session 1: Patrick Lee as Captain William Clark &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash; Lee is a professional speaker, actor and writer who has written a series of 21 articles about the Lewis and Clark Expedition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Session 2: Nina Tandon&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Tandon is a tissue engineer and a Senior TED Fellow studying electrical signaling with the goal of creating &amp;ldquo;spare parts&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; artificial hearts and bones &amp;mdash; for human implantation and/or disease models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Session 3: Dr. Ray Arvidson&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Arvidson is head of NASA&amp;rsquo;s Planetary Data System Geosciences Node and is the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor and Chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Session 5: Ken Ramirez&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Ramirez develops and supervises animal care programs, staff training and development as well as public presentation programs for the entire animal collection at Chicago&amp;rsquo;s Shedd Aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Session 6: Dr. Sylvia Earle&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; Dubbed a &amp;ldquo;Hero for the Planet&amp;rdquo; by &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine, Earle is an oceanographer, explorer, author, lecturer and Phi Theta Kappa alumna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Session 7: Pokey LaFarge&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; LaFarge is a musician, songwriter, bandleader, entertainer, innovator and preservationist whose well-rounded arsenal of talents has placed him at the forefront of American music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Session 4 will take attendees on a visit to the St. Louis Arch and Gateway Museum and the Old Courthouse, in addition to a riverboat ride along the Mississippi River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday, June 19, is R&amp;amp;R Day, giving attendees the opportunity to explore St. Louis on their own. Participants are responsible for the cost of any meals, trips, tours and admission fees on R&amp;amp;R Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/honors/institute"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get all of the 2014 Honors Institute details and register now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>The Mosal and Marshall Awards, and the Dreams They Fulfilled </title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/mosal-and-marshall-awards-fulfill-dreams 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-02-11T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, February 11, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kenneth Kerr was only 10 years old when his grandfather asked him a simple question that would come to shape everything he knew about his life: would he ever go back to the old country of his ancestors &amp;mdash; Ireland? In 2011 he finally did, as a recipient of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Mosal Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/JPEG%20image.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/JPEG%20image.JPG?itok=MG2El5Nh" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosal Award recipient Dr. Kenneth Kerr at the ruins of his great-grandfather&amp;#39;s birth home in Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mosal and Marshall Awards provide financial support to advisors for the completion of projects that lead to personal professional and leadership growth. Each award carries a $5,000 stipend, and the number presented each year varies depending on the quality of the applications and the availability of funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/1151010_10151777640786084_1720657391_n.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/1151010_10151777640786084_1720657391_n.jpg?itok=ZVtOyukf" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;2013 Marshall Award recipient Dr. Velda Arnaud with Dr. Jo Marshall during her Leadership Tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mosal Award was established in 1984 and is named in honor of Dr. Margaret Mosal, the Society&amp;rsquo;s first executive director. The Marshall Award was established in 2012 and is named for Dr. Jo Marshall, President of Somerset Community College in Kentucky who served the Society as an advisor for 30 years and as the Alabama Regional Coordinator for 28 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/DSC_0471.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/DSC_0471.JPG?itok=axysorjF" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosal Award recipient Dan Bailey, right, with Eric Chong, Phi Theta Kappa advisor at Guam Community College, and his daughter Erica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerr &amp;mdash; advisor to the Alpha Delta Sigma Chapter at Frederick Community College in Maryland &amp;mdash; was inspired to learn more about his ancestry following a Faculty Scholar Conference in 2009. During an icebreaker session, each Faculty Scholar was to place a dot on a map of the world on the place they considered &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; and explain why. Kerr, who had been reading about DNA ancestry, placed his dot on the eastern coast of Africa, near modern-day Tanzania, explaining that &amp;mdash; as the place where modern humans originated &amp;mdash; this was home to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That moment got me thinking about how I got from there to here,&amp;rdquo; Kerr said. &amp;ldquo;I wanted to trace my genetic ancestry back following the genetic mutations my male ancestors deposited on my Y chromosomes over the millennia. I wanted to do this physically and stand in the places where my DNA tells me I had an ancestor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mosal Award was a way he could help fund such a journey. Kerr submitted a proposal that included traveling to Northern Ireland for one month to interview locals, research the history of Ireland, and continue his genealogical research and &amp;ldquo;uncover the story of my family.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Applying for the Mosal Award made me look deeper into what it was I wanted to do and how it would benefit me personally and professionally,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Receiving the award made it possible to begin the first stage of a multi-year quest to visit the places my ancestors lived, eventually making my way to Tanzania in the years to come.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Rocky Mountain-Cascade Regional Coordinator Dr. Velda Arnaud of Lane Community College in Oregon has been a regular fixture at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention as an Educational Forum presenter. Her leadership presentations always see a high attendance &amp;mdash; so high, in fact, that they&amp;rsquo;re often standing room only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years she dreamed of taking her presentation on the road to Phi Theta Kappa chapters and regions across the country. Her dreams were realized in 2013 when she received the first Marshall Award. She conducted her first &amp;ldquo;Leadership Tour&amp;rdquo; through Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. She documented her journey here: &lt;a href="http://leadershiptour.wordpress.com/"&gt;http://leadershiptour.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wish that I could say that it fulfilled that dream and I have moved on to other things,&amp;rdquo; Arnaud said. &amp;ldquo;However, it has left me with a desire to conduct more leadership tours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Years ago I discovered that the things I have learned about leadership and social skills are valuable to our students. Therefore, I will take any opportunity to share my knowledge with others. I guess you could say that this is my passion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receiving the Mosal Award in 2009 allowed Dan Bailey, advisor of the Alpha Omega Gamma Chapter at Ashland Community and Technical College in Kentucky, to retrace his father&amp;rsquo;s footsteps &amp;mdash; literally. His father, a Marine, fought in the South Pacific during World War II in the battles for Saipan, Tinian and Okinawa and participated in the occupation of Nagasaki following the dropping of the atomic bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While preparing to go to church on Easter morning in 1995, my dad stood over a wash basin with shaving lather on his face and said to me, &amp;lsquo;Fifty years ago this morning, we hit the beaches of Okinawa,&amp;rsquo; &amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I call that a defining moment in my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal began with a conversation Bailey had with Eric Chong, a chapter advisor at Guam Community College, during an Annual Convention. Bailey told Chong that his father had been in Guam after it had been liberated from the Japanese in 1944.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Instantly, he gave me one of the sharpest salutes I have ever received and said, &amp;lsquo;The people of Guam and I salute your father and the brave men who fought for our freedom,&amp;rsquo; &amp;rdquo; Bailey said. &amp;ldquo;This sent chills up my spine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey, himself a soldier in the U.S. Army Reserve, longed to visit the sites where his father fought for freedom. The Mosal Award gave him that opportunity, even allowing him to spend Liberation Day in Guam &amp;mdash; a holiday that would not have been possible without the service of men like his father. During the 18-day period, he traveled more than 20,000 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He now shares his research and travels with high school, college, military, civic and community groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having the opportunity to complete the trip and to share my pictures and stories with my father before he passed away on October 27, 2013, was an unbelievable experience,&amp;rdquo; Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerr&amp;rsquo;s own defining moment &amp;mdash; that one, simple question from his grandfather &amp;mdash; set him off on a journey he never could have imagined. Like Bailey&amp;rsquo;s own adventure, it was a true attempt to see and better understand who and where he really came from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Almost all of us in the United States are orphans to our ancestry,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;It is difficult to find a structure or a family that has existed in any given place more than 300 years. Although I feel very much a part of my modern family and my community, deep inside I feel like an orphan longing to know who his father and mother are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerr and his wife stood at the altar of Garvaghy Church in Northern Ireland on the very spot where his great-great-grandparents were married. He sat on the cornerstone of the ruins of the farmhouse where his great-grandfather was born, and he looked out over the farm fields &amp;mdash; virtually unchanged since the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century &amp;mdash; on which his great-grandfather had worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I had a hint of a feeling that this orphan had come home,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The deadline to apply for the 2014 Mosal and Marshall Awards is February 21.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; All chapter advisors whose term as an advisor began on or before April 26, 2011, are eligible to apply for either award, although they may not apply for both in the same year.

     <title>Best Practices: Engaging Online Members</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/engaging-online-members 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-02-07T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Friday, February 7, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Herbert initially found her college experience to be very lonely. As an online student enrolled at Darton State College in Georgia &amp;mdash; more than 200 miles away from where she lived &amp;mdash; her options for engagement were limited. That is, until she found Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Graduation.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Graduation.jpg?itok=TfMNWOdb" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chi Xi member and now co-advisor Heather Herbert with Advisor Frank Malinowski at Herbert&amp;#39;s graduation from Darton State College in May 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In general, online students benefit from campus involvement the same way that on-campus (students) do &amp;mdash; it helps foster a feeling of community, of belonging and of personal engagement,&amp;rdquo; Herbert said. &amp;ldquo;This is critical for a student population that may feel disenfranchised simply because of the way they learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/Chi%20Xi%20Internationals.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Chi%20Xi%20Internationals.jpg?itok=rgSGNQe2" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chi Xi advisor Nicole Jones, then-chapter president Amber Miller, advisor Frank Malinowski, and then-Regional Secretary and Officer of Online Heather Herbert at Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s 2013 Annual Convention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa is a great way to bring the best of the college experience to students everywhere.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert is among a growing legion of college students taking online courses. A 2013 study by Babson Survey Research Group entitled &amp;ldquo;Grade Change: Tracking Online Education in the United States&amp;rdquo; found that the percentage of college students taking at least one online course has steadily increased over the last decade, jumping to 33.5 percent in the fall of 2012 from just 9.6 percent in the fall of 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa is embracing this growing demographic by offering such tools and resources as &lt;a href="http://www.collegefish.org"&gt;CollegFish.org,&lt;/a&gt; Competitive Edge, the Leadership Development Studies Facebook Study Group, &lt;em&gt;Nota Bene&lt;/em&gt; and the USA TODAY Case Study Challenge, all of which can be done online. The Society even chartered its first online-only chapter in 2012: the Beta Tau Chi Chapter at Ashford University, based in San Diego, California, which serves students nationwide. And, the Society&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa?ref=br_tf"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; is followed by more than 58,000 members and advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;(Online students) can&amp;rsquo;t participate in everything we do, but they can participate in most things that we do,&amp;rdquo; said Frank Malinowski, advisor of the Chi Xi Chapter at Darton State College and Georgia Regional Coordinator. &amp;ldquo;With things like our Honors in Action and College Projects, online students have just as much of an ability to participate. It&amp;rsquo;s really a matter of letting them know they can be involved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinowski is dean of the School of Science and Mathematics at Darton State. Since joining the school five years ago, he has taught numerous computer science courses online. He became a chapter advisor shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After holding his first induction ceremony, Malinowski met a new member who was interested in a leadership office. But, he was an online student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So I just created a position for him &amp;mdash; Vice President of Online,&amp;rdquo; Malinowski said. &amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa was completely new to me, so I was just learning as I went. We wanted to test the waters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinowski estimates that about a third of the students at Darton State College are online only. And, he said about another third take at least one online class. He believes that engaging these students in addition to the on-campus ones is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We need to be flexible and meet the needs of the students,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;Of course you will run into some situations where it&amp;rsquo;s easier if you&amp;rsquo;re in the same location &amp;mdash; or where you both have to be in the same location &amp;mdash; but for the most part, we now have the technology to include everyone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chi Xi Chapter streams its regular chapter meetings online to help increase member participation. Someone there at the meeting runs a live chat with online members so they can ask questions and make comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By allowing this interaction, Malinowski is able to find potential leaders from his entire membership, not just those he sees regularly and in-person. Heather Herbert was one of those leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert is a 43-year-old mother to three young girls, so she found that receiving her education online would best suit her lifestyle. A friend encouraged her to accept her invitation to join Phi Theta Kappa when it arrived, and she admits that she initially did so to gain access to the scholarship opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As an online student, I never thought I could be involved,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;However, Frank and I had a long chat during one of my (then) infrequent visits to campus, and he let me know that not only would it be possible for me to be involved with the chapter, but I would be welcome. For an online student, that is wonderful to hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We get used to hearing about things we cannot do. Frank was encouraging and eager to facilitate my involvement and always made me feel valued.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Herbert was more engaged than she ever thought possible. She served as both a chapter and a regional officer; she ran for international office and received the Orlowski Candidate Scholarship; she received a Reynolds Scholarship for work selected for publication in &lt;em&gt;Nota Bene&lt;/em&gt;; she was instrumental in the Hallmark Awards writing process; and she received a Distinguished Chapter Officer Award. Now, she&amp;rsquo;s a co-advisor for the Chi Xi Chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She received three associate degrees from Darton State College &amp;mdash; in psychology, history and English &amp;mdash; and is now an online English major at the University of Maine at Presque Isle. She will graduate in May and is in the process of applying to an online master&amp;rsquo;s program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I do not think I would have done this well without Phi Theta Kappa to keep me fully engaged and motivated,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Students on-ground are given extracurricular activities to foster a feeling of engagement and community, which in turn aids retention and graduation rates. Students online can benefit from the same types of programs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinowski echoes this sentiment, saying that engaging online students &amp;ldquo;completely changes&amp;rdquo; the college experience they&amp;rsquo;re having. It also helps them gain visibility for faculty- and administration-nominated awards and scholarships, such as an All-State Academic Team. He said there are also benefits for the organization and for the college itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whatever it is, it&amp;rsquo;s better when you have more involvement,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;You have better discussions, you get more ideas, and you increase the potential that you&amp;rsquo;ll do more interesting things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you will be continuing your education at a two-year college in the fall, then these scholarships are tailor-made for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than $260,000 will be awarded through scholarships on the Spring Common Scholarship Application. &lt;strong&gt;The deadline to apply is April 30.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Applying early is key to a successful scholarship application,&amp;rdquo; said Heather Johnson, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Scholarship Programs. &amp;ldquo;As you might expect, the applications we receive are high-quality, and the process is competitive. But, you&amp;rsquo;ll never receive a scholarship if you never apply for one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is an in-depth look at the scholarships offered on the Spring Common Scholarship Application. You may apply for any or all of the scholarships for which you qualify. Learn even more and apply today on the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;Scholarships webpage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Lanza Memorial Scholarship &amp;mdash; &lt;/strong&gt;This scholarship recognizes the outstanding academic and leadership accomplishments of students who are enrolled in regionally accredited community college programs in registered nursing, respiratory care or emergency medical services.

Twenty-five of these scholarships are specifically earmarked for students who are military veterans or who are currently active members of the military.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, seven Global Leaders of Promise Scholars will be named.

Preference will be given to students who have served as chapter, regional or international officers or who have held a leadership position in another college club or community organization.

     <title>Changes Coming to Hallmark Awards Presentations </title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/hallmark-awards-presentation-changes 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-01-31T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Friday, January 31, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to both provide greater recognition to award recipients and reduce the length of Annual Convention General Sessions, Phi Theta Kappa will institute several changes in the presentation of Hallmark Awards at &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/"&gt;NerdNation 2014&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando, Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regional, Member and Advisor Award winners will be notified by email in early April prior to the Convention, which will be held April 24-26. Emails will also be sent to the Chapter Advisor, the Regional Coordinator, and the College President/Chapter Administrator announcing the award. Press releases will be distributed prior to Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Award recipients will receive commemorative medallions and ribbons for their Convention name badges upon on-site registration. This will allow for recognition throughout the entirety of Convention, which will in turn provide opportunities for new members and advisors to learn first-hand about the endeavors that lead to such recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the Society&amp;rsquo;s hope that this opportunity to share success for the duration of Convention will help strengthen Phi Theta Kappa members, chapters and advisors as they network with and learn from each other. Award recipients will also be recognized as a group on stage during a Convention general session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter Awards &amp;mdash; including Distinguished Chapters, Honors in Action Project and College Project &amp;mdash; will still be announced during the Hallmark Awards Gala, to be held Saturday, April 26.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notifying winners beforehand will allow for increased recognition before, during and after Convention. These changes will allow the Hallmark Awards Gala, which typically lasts more than two hours, to be reduced about 90 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;You spoke, and we listened,&amp;rdquo; said Phi Theta Kappa Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley. &amp;ldquo;Finding a way to reduce the length of the general sessions but still fully honor and recognize our members, advisors and regions for their hard work and excellence was certainly a challenge. We feel that the changes we are making will not only increase recognition of award winners, but it will also enhance and improve the overall Convention Experience for all attendees.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Regional Coordinator Emeritus Award&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Regional Coordinator Distinguished Service Award&lt;/strong&gt; will be presented at the regional meetings held during the Convention, with the recipients also recognized at the Regional Coordinator dinner on April 23 and the Advisors Luncheon on April 26.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Regional Officer Awards&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Regional Officer Team Awards&lt;/strong&gt; will be presented at the regional meetings. Each winner will receive a medallion and a ribbon for his/her Convention name badge upon check-in. The winners will also be featured during the Flag Ceremony in the opening general session on April 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional Milestone Awards, Distinguished Region Awards&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Continued Excellence for Regions Awards&lt;/strong&gt; will be presented at the regional meetings, and the winning regions&amp;rsquo; members will receive ribbons for their name badges. The regions will also be spotlighted during the Flag Ceremony and the Regional Coordinator dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Regional Coordinator Awards&lt;/strong&gt; will be presented at the regional meetings, and the winners will be showcased during the Flag Ceremony and the Regional Coordinator dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Member and Officer Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winners of the &lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Chapter Member Awards, Distinguished Chapter Officer Awards&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Chapter Officer Team Awards&lt;/strong&gt; will be recognized as a group on stage during a general session. They will each receive a commemorative medallion and a ribbon for their name badges upon Convention check-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advisor Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winners of the &lt;strong&gt;Paragon Award for New Advisors, Distinguished Advisor Awards&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Continued Excellence Award for Advisors&lt;/strong&gt; will receive a commemorative medallion and a ribbon for their name badge. They will be recognized as a group on stage during a general session and also during the Advisors Luncheon on April 26.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President and Administrator Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All awards for College Presidents and Administrators will be announced at the College Presidents and Administrators Recognition Luncheon on April 25. The awards that will be given are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Michael Bennett Lifetime Achievement Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished College Administrator Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished Community College State Director Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Chapter Awards will be announced live during the Hallmark Awards Gala on April 26. Chapter Award winners will not be notified prior to Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;College Project Awards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honors in Action Project Awards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Honors in Action Theme Awards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguished Chapters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta Alpha Continued Excellence Award&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 100 Chapters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 Chapters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Distinguished Chapter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptions of each Hallmark Award can be found &lt;a href="https://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark/categories"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; You can also view the full &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/schedule"&gt;NerdNation 2014 schedule.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org/register/event"&gt;Register today&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/191" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Events &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Risley praised Dr. Pierce as a longtime supporter of Phi Theta Kappa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In thinking back over two decades, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to think about an aspect of Phi Theta Kappa that Dr. David Pierce did not influence &amp;ndash; from the presenting of the All-USA Community College Academic Team during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s President&amp;#39;s Breakfast at the AACC Convention, to supporting the establishment of All-State Academic Teams, leading Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s first-ever capital campaign, and the construction of Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Center for Excellence,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Risley said. &amp;ldquo;Even after serving for 11 years on our Board of Directors, most as Vice Chair, he continued to engage in Society initiatives and give back through the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Phi Theta Kappa was proud to recognize David&amp;#39;s contribution to the work of Phi Theta Kappa by conferring its highest honor to a non-member, International Honorary Membership. Without question he left an incredible legacy in his work with community college education and Phi Theta Kappa, and he will be deeply missed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pierce became the second AACC leader to serve on the Society&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors (following Dr. Dale Parnell), serving from 1992 to 2003 and as Vice Chair from 2001 to 2003. During his tenure he led the participation of community college presidents in the Society&amp;rsquo;s first capital campaign to raise funds for construction of the Center for Excellence, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s permanent Headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pierce is also credited with beginning the tradition of recognizing the All-USA Community College Academic Team during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s annual President&amp;rsquo;s Breakfast at the AACC convention and assisting with the development of the Centennial Scholars Program (today the New Century Scholars program), which honors the top community college student in each state. In gratitude for his service, he was named an International Honorary Member of Phi Theta Kappa in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As President and CEO of the American Association of Community Colleges from 1991 to 2000, Dr. Pierce led AACC through financial challenges into restructuring and expanding into the international arena. Prior to his selection as AACC President, he served as President of North Iowa Area Community College, President of the Illinois Community College Board, and Chancellor of the Virginia Community College System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing an associate degree at Fullerton College, Dr. Pierce earned baccalaureate and master&amp;#39;s degrees in mathematics and education from California State University at Long Beach and a doctorate from Purdue University. A native of Oklahoma, he served in the United States Marine Corps and is a veteran of the Korean War. At the time of his death, he was enjoying retirement and travel from his Normal, Illinois, home with Maureen, his wife of 56 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviewed recently for Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Visionary &lt;/em&gt;Magazine and &lt;em&gt;History of Impact Publication&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Pierce recalled his service on the Society&amp;rsquo;s Board of Directors and reiterated his unwavering support for Phi Theta Kappa, calling it &amp;ldquo;the marvel and envy of the educational world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A Phi Theta Kappa chapter benefits students by providing an almost unlimited number of opportunities in the form of scholarships, recognitions, honors, networking and enrichment programs. A student who becomes active in Phi Theta Kappa and takes advantage of its program opportunities will benefit in a transformational way as both a person and student,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I think Phi Theta Kappa provides motivation and recognition for students who historically didn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from those advantages. It&amp;rsquo;s our standard-bearer for community colleges &amp;mdash; making opportunities available that weren&amp;rsquo;t previously there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pierce was also a member of Phi Theta Kappa Foundation&amp;rsquo;s Athena Society, having remembered the Society in his estate planning. His wife, Maureen, and their children requested that, in lieu of flowers, gifts be made in Dr. Pierce&amp;#39;s memory to the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation Scholarship Fund &lt;a href="https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/ptkfoundation"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, or by contacting Philanthropy Coordinator Karri Chaney, &lt;a href="mailto:karri.chaney@ptk.org"&gt;karri.chaney@ptk.org&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;at 601.987.5507. To give by mail, make checks payable to Phi Theta Kappa Foundation and mail to the Center for Excellence, 1625 Eastover Drive, Jackson, MS&amp;nbsp; 39211.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A private family graveside service inurnment will be held on Wednesday, January &amp;nbsp;22, at the East Lawn Cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois. There will be no visitation, but messages of condolence may be left at the &lt;a href="http://www.legacy.com/guestbooks/oklahoman/guestbook.aspx?n=david-pierce&amp;amp;pid=169167638&amp;amp;cid=full#sthash.Bn3cgH89.dpbs"&gt;guestbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembrances of Dr. Pierce may also be shared on the Phi Theta Kappa &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/phithetakappa"&gt;Facebook page &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/PhiThetaKappaAlumni"&gt;alumni Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read Dr. Pierce&amp;rsquo;s complete obituary at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ccdaily.com/Pages/Campus-Issues/Pierce-obituary.aspx"&gt;Community College Daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2014/01/22/david-pierce-national-community-college-leader-dies"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Higher Ed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/oklahoman/obituary.aspx?n=DAVID-PIERCE&amp;amp;pid=169167638#sthash.uxqTEMJv.dpuf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Oklahoman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-01-21T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, January 21, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;Jackson, MS - The Phi Theta Kappa Foundation is pleased to announce that the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation will be increasing their support of the Society&amp;rsquo;s Leaders of Promise program from $150,000 to $200,000. The expanded funding will allow Phi Theta Kappa to award over 200 scholarships of $1,000 each and impact 50 additional Phi Theta Kappa members annually, including members of the military and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coca-Cola Scholar Foundation logo" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/coca_cola_scholar_logo_web.jpg" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Twenty-five of the additional scholarships, a total of $25,000, will be earmarked for Society members who are active personnel or veterans of the U.S. military. J. Mark Davis, President of the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation, said their organization feels strongly about supporting active-duty service members and veterans in their educational quest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2013 the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation teamed up with broadcast legend Tom Brokaw to provide one $5,000 scholarship to a returning military veteran or active-duty service member in a discipline of his/her choice at 10 designated community colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Heather Johnson, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Director of Scholarship Programs, said the application process for Leaders of Promise scholarships will remain the same, with active-duty personnel and veterans being asked to answer one additional question and provide proof of current military duty or a copy of separation papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Beyond the 200 awards, additional scholarships will be provided to international students through the Phi Theta Kappa Global Leaders of Promise Scholarship fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new scholarships will be available during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Spring Common Application period, open from February 3 through April 30. Application information is available at &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;This increase of $50,000 for our Leaders of Promise program indicates the confidence the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation has in us to reach and impact more community college students through scholarships,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Nancy Rieves, CEO of the Phi Theta Kappa Foundation, citing the long and productive partnership between Phi Theta Kappa and the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Leaders of Promise Scholarships were established by Phi Theta Kappa in 2001 as part of the Society&amp;rsquo;s long-range plan to provide financial support to members still enrolled in community colleges. Scholarship recipients are chosen for academic achievement and leadership potential, which they fulfill by engaging in college and community service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation announced they would provide $150,000 in additional support, allowing Phi Theta Kappa to increase annually the number of $1,000 Leaders of Promise scholarships from the 30 that Phi Theta Kappa were already awarding to 180.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We soon recognized the impact that our awards were having for students at two-year colleges or those who were transferring to four-year campuses,&amp;rdquo; Davis said. &amp;ldquo;Seeing the success of so many students encouraged us to deepen our commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Community college students, and particularly Phi Theta Kappa members, inspire me because of their aspirations &amp;mdash; to learn more, do more, be more and make a better community for us all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation has supported the New Century Scholars Program, the Coca-Cola Community College Academic Team Program and the Leaders of Promise with an annual commitment of more than $400,000 in scholarships and stipends. To date, they have awarded more than $5 million to nearly 5,000 two-year college students. Visit &lt;a href="http://www.coca-colascholars.org"&gt;coca-colascholars.org&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, plus Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. More than 2.5 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 135,000 students inducted annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/193" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Higher Ed Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

     <title>Phi Theta Kappa Members Serve Higher Ed Through Pearson</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/pearson-student-advisor-board-story 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-01-21T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Tuesday, January 21, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serving as president of her Phi Theta Kappa chapter exposed Derya Demirtas to conversations about higher education, sparking a desire to make a difference using her own voice. Her opportunity came when she applied for and was accepted to join the 2013-2014 Pearson Student Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/amherst%20id%20jpg.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/amherst%20id%20jpg.jpg" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derya Demirtas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pearson Student Advisory Board (PSAB) is comprised of undergraduate students seeking to implement change and impact college classrooms across the country and world. Board members work directly with Pearson executives and product development teams to make real changes to products and services that in turn affect student success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/PSAB%20DBlake.JPG" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/PSAB%20DBlake.JPG" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dianna Blake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is consistently amazing to me how much Pearson as a company truly cares about the student voice and making sure that voice is incorporated into their products,&amp;rdquo; Demirtas said. &amp;ldquo;Being able to see the tangible effects of my input into key Pearson products and initiatives is truly incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am constantly amazed by how much Pearson listens to my voice and makes sure that voice is heard.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearson is the world&amp;rsquo;s leading learning company, providing educational materials, technologies, assessments and related services to teachers and students of all ages. Pearson has been a valued friend to Phi Theta Kappa over the years, sponsoring the Community College Completion Corps (C4) Toolkits and the advisor luncheon during Honors Institute and sharing a listing of free webinars to help support and educate Society advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearson is currently accepting applications for the 2014-2015 Student Advisory Board. &lt;strong&gt;The deadline to apply is January 31.&lt;/strong&gt; Between 10 and 15 students representing North America will be selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is critical that Pearson put the learner at the center of all that we do to affect student success,&amp;rdquo; said Andrea Shaw, Director of Student Programs and Partnerships for Pearson who also serves as the Director of the PSAB. &amp;ldquo;Involving these students in our product and services development stages, to help us develop the best, most outcomes-focused offerings, is critical to improving education worldwide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PSAB members collaborate and provide insights to mission-critical Pearson initiatives while gaining real world experiences and networking with high-level executives. Members must be able to travel during the term of service. They also receive a $1,000 stipend and complimentary copies of Pearson textbooks and learning products like MyMathLab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw said that three of the 11 students currently serving on the PSAB are Phi Theta Kappa members and that they represent perhaps the most beneficial part of Pearson&amp;rsquo;s partnership with Phi Theta Kappa. She said it is critical to hear the voice of the community college student, as it allows the organization to do what it can to increase completion and success rates for these students as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa students continue to show us that they have proven leadership and analytical skills, outstanding written and verbal communication skills, and are self-motivated team players,&amp;rdquo; Shaw said. &amp;ldquo;The biggest differentiator though is their passion for making a difference and impacting the future of global minds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demirtas, from Branchville, New Jersey, is the first in her family to attend college. The 20-year-old began her education at Sussex County Community College, where she was inducted into the Alpha Upsilon Pi Chapter. After receiving her associate degree, she transferred to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where she is an English major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reading the &amp;ldquo;Community College Success&amp;rdquo; blog, run by Phi Theta Kappa alumna and author Isa Adney, Demirtas found a post about the PSAB. As she grew excited about the opportunity, she also grew doubtful that she would be selected &amp;mdash;members of the board hail from both two-year and four-year colleges across the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I wanted to gain the experience of working with Pearson to see if I wanted to continue engaging in these conversations (around higher education),&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I was so shocked and amazed when I got the call saying that I was selected! Surrounding yourself with other talented and bright individuals will motivate and inspire you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demirtas now writes a weekly guest blog for &amp;ldquo;Community College Success.&amp;rdquo; She plans to attend graduate school after receiving her bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Serving on the Advisory Board has further reinforced these goals, as I began to realize how passionate I am about education and student success,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Gaining the experience of working within education and having the opportunity to shape and implement tools to further enhance every learner has made me more passionate about making sure every student has the opportunity to succeed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow 2013-2014 board member Dianna Blake of Chino, California, is also a first-generation college student passionate about being a part of the change in education. The 34-year-old wife and mother of three recently received her associate degree from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California, where she was inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa. She is currently attending California State University in Fullerton and majoring in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once I researched the program, I knew I had to apply,&amp;rdquo; Blake said. What did she hope to accomplish? &amp;ldquo;To give valuable input to the company, to gain knowledge of the education system, to become a better person. And to help make a difference in education.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since being named to the advisory board, Blake has started a blog, &amp;ldquo;College Success for Moms,&amp;rdquo; and is planning to write a book by the same name &amp;mdash; an idea born from the board&amp;rsquo;s first summit meeting. She said working with a company like Pearson &amp;mdash; which is focused on educating the &amp;ldquo;whole student&amp;rdquo; and made up of many people collaborating for that single purpose &amp;mdash; has been very inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You get to network with other students and executives; you get to be part of this major company that is helping improve education; you get to help change the face of education&amp;hellip;I think that is a big deal,&amp;rdquo; Blake said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pearsonstudents.com/get-involved/advisory-board/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pearson Student Advisory Board&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and apply to join the 2014-2015 team.

     <title>2014 Leadership Certification Seminars Announced</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/leadership-certification-seminars-set 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-01-17T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Friday, January 17, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/get-involved/leadership-development"&gt;Leadership Development Program&lt;/a&gt; is a resource for our members as they engage with Honors in Action and develop as both scholars and leaders on their campuses and in their communities through their engagement with the Honors Study Topic. Leadership Instructor Certification Seminars are a key part of this program for advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Phi Theta Kappa Leadership Development Program covers the traditional leadership development topics that will always be important,&amp;rdquo; said Monika Byrd, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Leadership Development and Service Learning. &amp;ldquo;Our approach to leadership development is that it must be personal and individual, so the foundation of the program relates to self-awareness and to creating the environment for the development of a personal philosophy of leadership for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This creates authentic leadership capacity, which builds confidence and purpose and which can evolve with a person&amp;rsquo;s educational and professional career.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leadership Development Studies curriculum is grounded in the humanities and delivers a diverse, interdisciplinary approach to leadership instruction. It has been recognized by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as one of only eight Exemplary Leadership Development Programs in Higher Education among those the Kellogg Foundation funded and researched during the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Leadership Development Studies Curriculum is life-changing,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Mary Thornley, President of Trident Technical College in South Carolina. &amp;ldquo;It is a thoroughly developed, exceptional curriculum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who would like to facilitate a leadership development program using the Phi Theta Kappa curriculum must be certified through a Leadership Instructor Certification Seminar.

Resurreccion Public Safety Scholarship Endowment provides scholarships exclusively to Phi Theta Kappa members who demonstrate potential for or involvement in public safety services while enrolled in a regionally accredited associate degree public safety program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;IPSLEI Scholar Patricia Esperon did not have an easy start in life, living with a mother who was a mentally unstable alcoholic while her father was in prison. By the time Esperon ran away from home at the age of 16, she had attended 12 different schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I spent the next few years trying to unlearn the cycles of strife that I had lived with for so long,&amp;rdquo; she said. Today Esperon has been married for 12 years, is the mother of two children, has run successful small businesses, and is active in her church and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Through parenting their adopted son who had previously suffered abuse, Esperon and her husband now serve as therapeutic parents and family coaches, helping adopted children and their parents who are struggling with building new relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;A Phi Theta Kappa member who has earned a 4.0 grade point average at Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, Esperon plans to pursue bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and master&amp;rsquo;s degrees in criminal justice and psychology, hoping to build a career helping those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Fellow IPSLEI scholarship recipient Roxanne Skal is a Phi Theta Kappa member at Delgado Community College in New Orleans, where she maintains a 3.88 grade point average. She describes her college education as the &amp;ldquo;next phase of her life&amp;rdquo; after raising four children as a single mother on a poverty-level income and facing a brief bout with alcohol and drug dependency. Through her challenges, Skal said she has gained a variety of skills and knowledge and has spent the past nine years spreading her message of recovery to others. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have decided that working with others to recover their lives is the most worthwhile endeavor I can pursue,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I have survived, and the best use of my experiences is to use them to encourage others to not only survive, but thrive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In the past year she has completed substance abuse counselor training and two sessions of training for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). She hopes to earn a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree and to eventually develop counselling programs that address rehabilitation and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;In 2012 the International Public Safety Leadership and Ethics Institute (IPSLEI) partnered with Phi Theta Kappa to establish a scholarship endowment to be named in honor of Dr. Richard L. Resurreccion, Professor Emeritus of the College of Health and Human Services at California State University, Long Beach. A member of the IPSLEI Board of Directors, Dr. Resurreccion has 47 years of teaching experience in the first responder field at the secondary, two-year college, military and university levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;For more information on the Richard L. Resurreccion Public Safety Scholarship, contact Phi Theta Kappa&amp;#39;s Scholarship Programs department at scholarship.programs@ptk.org, 601.987.5741, or visit &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships"&gt;ptk.org/become-a-member/scholarships&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on how your can contribute to the scholarship endowment, visit &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/foundation"&gt;ptk.org/foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;The International Public Safety Leadership and Ethics Institute was developed to bring the concepts of leadership and ethics to the forefront of an individual&amp;#39;s career, rather than waiting until a person is promoted into a supervisory position. This program is based on the belief one need not be a supervisor or manager to understand leadership principles and contribute to the leadership process. A cornerstone of the program is that effective leadership skills and influences are needed at all levels of the organization. This program utilizes the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society Leadership Development Program as a foundational component to the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in American higher education with nearly 1,300 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions. More than 2.5 million students have been inducted since its founding in 1918, with approximately 135,000 students inducted annually.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/192" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Press Room&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Members aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones who receive recognition &amp;mdash; advisors play a critical role in the success of a chapter and may be nominated to receive their own special awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Advisor Hallmark Awards are given during Annual Convention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="default"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragon Awards for New Advisors: &lt;/strong&gt;a one-time award that recognizes advisors with less than four years of service as of the Annual Convention who have made significant contributions to the growth of the individual members, served as the chapter&amp;rsquo;s advocate on campus, and encouraged the chapter to be involved on the local, regional and/or international level of the organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Advisor Awards:&lt;/strong&gt; a one-time award recognizing advisors for the same criteria as the Paragon Award. The exception is that advisors must have served at least four years or more at the time of Annual Convention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continued Excellence for Advisors: &lt;/strong&gt;this award recognizes advisors for the same criteria as the previous two awards with the exception that the advisor must have already received the Distinguished Advisor Award. Once that award has been received, the advisor becomes eligible for the Continued Excellence Award the following year. Advisors are eligible to win this award every other year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications for Advisor Hallmark Awards are due by &lt;strong&gt;5:00 pm CST on January 29.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chapter president is responsible for setting up the collaboration team for the three advisor awards.

     <title>Counting Down to the Five Star Plan Reporting Deadline</title> 
     <link>https://www.ptk.org/news/countdown-to-five-star-deadline 
     <description>
      &lt;div class="field field-name-field-dateline field-type-datestamp field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;span class="date-display-single" property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2014-01-10T00:00:00-06:00"&gt;Friday, January 10, 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 700 Phi Theta Kappa chapters set a Five Star Chapter Plan Goal in 2013. To receive your hard-earned recognition, we encourage you to report your progress by &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, January 29.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Five Star Chapter Plan is a roadmap for creating strong chapters, which in turn creates strong members and a robust college campus. The plan puts the mission of Phi Theta Kappa into action through five levels of engagement that progress from local, campus involvement to regional and international involvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;One of the important roles Phi Theta Kappa plays is cultivating leadership,&amp;rdquo; said Dr. Cindy Miles, Chancellor of the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District in California. &amp;ldquo;To meet our college completion and transfer goals, we need students as strong, engaged partners.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Phi Theta Kappa chapters are encouraged to participate at the level that fits them best each year. Participation at every level of the Five Star Plan is critical to fulfilling the mission of Phi Theta Kappa, said Jennifer Stanford, the Society&amp;rsquo;s Chief Student Engagement Officer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 29 is a big day at Phi Theta Kappa &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s also the deadline to submit Hallmark Awards applications. So don&amp;rsquo;t let the Five Star reporting deadline get lost in the shuffle. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know now to ensure your chapter gets the full recognition it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not wait until the deadline to report your chapter&amp;rsquo;s progress.&lt;/strong&gt; Both advisors and chapter officers may report progress in the Five Star Chapter Plan as activities are completed throughout the year at &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;ptk.org/fivestar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hallmark Awards participation will be updated in early February, following the January 29 deadline for submitting applications.&lt;/strong&gt; Phi Theta Kappa Headquarters Staff will automatically update the activity for chapters submitting entries after the Hallmark Awards deadline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters will be recognized for their 2013 Five Star achievements in the spring of 2014.&lt;/strong&gt; Chapters are recognized for the highest level for which they completed AND reported all the requirements in addition to completing and reporting all of the requirements of the levels below that highest level. There are three levels of recognition: &lt;ul class="default"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Local: An email will be sent to your college president citing the significance of the chapter&amp;rsquo;s achievement.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Regional: The chapter will receive the award certificate during your region&amp;rsquo;s annual awards presentation in the spring.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;International: The achievement will be listed on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s website and at the 2014 Annual Convention.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information for the 2014 Five Star Chapter Plan will be posted on Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s website in February.&lt;/strong&gt; A breakdown of the plan can be found in the Chapter Leaders&amp;rsquo; Guide to Success, which all advisors will be receiving soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guide includes a suggested timeline aimed at helping you complete your goal. New advisors and chapter presidents will also receive this helpful tool as they are reported to Headquarters throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every chapter begins anew every calendar year, allowing chapters to have a fresh start and a challenging goal year after year,&amp;rdquo; Stanford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The topic is divided into nine themes:&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 1: Nature of the Quest&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 2: Ideas and Ideologies as Frontiers&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 3: Quests of Human Expression&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 4: Exploring the Natural Environment&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 5: Celestial Frontiers&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 6: Frontiers of Temporal &amp;amp; Spatial Physics&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 7: Health and Medicine as Frontiers&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 8: Exploring the Political Economy&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Theme 9: Borders and Boundaries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are thrilled to introduce this new Honors Study Topic, and we cannot wait to see what inspirations our chapters draw from it,&amp;rdquo; said Susan Edwards, Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Dean of Academic Affairs and Honors Programs. &amp;ldquo;This is an Honors Study Topic that truly lends itself to the scholarly research of previously unexplored areas of interest surrounding a chapter and its college campus and community. We are excited to see the discoveries our chapters make as they delve deeper into the Honors Study Topic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honors in Action is Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Honors Program and is designed to engage honors students in actions that foster student success and help fulfill the mission of the Society. Participation in Honors in Action contributes to personal, academic and career development and affords students the leadership and service-learning opportunities that have an impact on their campuses and in their communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Honors in Action process is broken down into eight steps:&lt;br /&gt;1. Read the Honors Program Guide and choose one of its nine themes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Develop a research plan and objectives.&lt;br /&gt;3. Explore several sources about the Honors Study Topic theme to narrow your focus.&lt;br /&gt;4. Investigate the specific research questions/focus of theme.&lt;br /&gt;5. Analyze research and develop conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;6. Develop a plan of action that includes leadership opportunities to address the specific need identified.&lt;br /&gt;7. Carry out the plan.&lt;br /&gt;8. Write the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The findings of the research and the resulting Honors in Action Project may be submitted to the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/benefits/awards/hallmark"&gt;Hallmark Awards Program&lt;/a&gt; for recognition during Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention. Participation in the Honors in Action program can also help fulfill levels of the &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/fivestar"&gt;Five Star Chapter Plan.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://nerdnation.ptk.org"&gt;NerdNation 2014&lt;/a&gt; speakers &amp;mdash; explorers Alison Levine and Dr. Robert Ballard &amp;mdash; will address the new Honors Study Topic in their presentations during the Annual Convention April 24-26 in Orlando, Florida. Honors Institute, to be held June 16-21 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, is a weeklong exploration of the Honors Study Topic featuring guest speakers and small group discussions. Look for more details about the 2014 Honors Institute to be announced soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All chapters will receive the new Honors Program Guide sometime in January. The guide details the new Honors Study Topic, outlines the nine themes, and provides a sample Honors in Action project for each theme. &lt;a href="http://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/docs/honors/2014-2015_honors_program_guide.pdf"&gt;View the 2014/2015 Honors Program Guide now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field field-name-field-article-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-inline clearfix"&gt;&lt;div class="field-label"&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-items"&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/189" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;The Experience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item odd"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="field-item even"&gt;&lt;a href="/taxonomy/term/190" typeof="skos:Concept" property="rdfs:label skos:prefLabel" datatype=""&gt;Engagement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The award will be presented during the Society&amp;rsquo;s Annual Convention, April 24-26, 2014, in Orlando.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption_photo right"&gt;&lt;a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image" href="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/McClenney%20Kay_Standard7950web.jpg" rel="gallery-all" title=""&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.ptk.org/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/McClenney%20Kay_Standard7950web.jpg" title="" typeof="foaf:Image" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kay McClenney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Phi Theta Kappa, Phi Beta Kappa, and the National Honor Society launched an initiative, The Alliance for Educational Excellence, to promote broad-based excellence in learning at all levels of education. Phi Theta Kappa has assumed the leadership role for this initiative, which now includes many international and national education-based organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director and CEO Dr. Rod Risley said the award is being presented in recognition of the Center&amp;rsquo;s work undertaken to improve student success in community colleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As a result of CCCSE&amp;rsquo;s distinguished body of work, community colleges better understand the varied and daunting challenges their students face in their journey to complete college,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Risley said. &amp;ldquo;This award gives notice to the extraordinary contribution the Center has made by sharing broadly promising practices that truly impact the success of all students.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We will also pay tribute to the remarkable and enduring leadership of the Center&amp;rsquo;s Director, Dr. Kay McClenney,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Risley said, adding that her contribution in shaping the work and focus of community colleges on a national level is unrivaled. He cited her impactful role on the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century Commission of the Future of Community Colleges and the subsequent Implementation Teams initiative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps her most important contribution to the field is that she kept us focused on students&amp;rsquo; aspirations and needs &amp;ndash; through their voices,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Risley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Risley also noted that CCCSE has contributed to the work of Phi Theta Kappa by allowing scholarship recipients the opportunity to complete the Community College Survey of Student Engagement. Through CCSSE results, Phi Theta Kappa is able to confirm the value and impact of Phi Theta Kappa programs in supporting and increasing student success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past recipients of the Alliance for Educational Excellence Award have included USA TODAY for its 20 years of support for the All-USA Community College Academic Team; the Coca-Cola Foundation and Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation for their support of the New Century Scholars Program, Coca-Cola Community College Academic Team Program, and Leaders of Promise Scholarship Program; the American Association of Community Colleges for their support and engagement with Phi Theta Kappa spanning several decades; the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation for their efforts in raising the issue of equity with regard to selective senior colleges admitting community college transfer students; and the Hites Family Community College Scholarship Foundation for their contribution of over $2 million for the establishment of an endowment for Phi Theta Kappa transfer scholarships.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi, is the largest honor society in American higher education with 1,285 chapters on college campuses in all 50 of the United States, Canada, Germany, the Republic of Palau, Peru, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates and U.S. territorial possessions.
