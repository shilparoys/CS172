     <h2>Understand your real college costs</h2> 
     <p>Your net cost to attend Westmont will likely be much less than our published tuition, fees and living expenses. If you apply for financial aid (we urge every student to apply), your actual cost to enroll at Westmont depends on your family’s financial need and your eligibility for merit- and talent-based scholarships.<strong> Westmont commits a significant amount of financial aid ($21 million) to scholarships and grants</strong>, making our high-quality education affordable to students from a wide range of economic backgrounds. </p> 
     <p class="big-quote-2">For the 2013-14 school year, students with demonstrated need received an average award of $28,681.</p>

     <h2>Discover Affordable Education at Westmont</h2> 
     <p>The sticker price of public universities and other private schools may be lower, but Westmont provides great value. Many students discover that the generous assistance they receive from Westmont means they pay less than if they’d attended a public university or other independent college. Moreover, 73 percent of Westmont students graduate in four years, which is 28 percent higher than the national <i>six-year</i> graduation rate. If your education drags on elsewhere, the costs will add up quickly—particularly if your financial aid expires after four years. You will also lose tens of thousands of dollars of earning power for every year you delay entering the workforce. An average of <strong>95 percent</strong> of incoming first-year and transfer students <strong>receive academic and/or talent-based scholarships</strong>.</p>

     <h2>Recognize the value of Westmont</h2> 
     <p class="no-space">You invest in your intellectual, personal, spiritual and social development when you enroll at Westmont. Nationally recognized for our excellent academics, <strong>Westmont ranks among the country’s top 100 liberal arts colleges</strong>—and the top 10 in California—in U.S. News &amp; World Report’s “America’s Best Colleges.” The Princeton Review has named Westmont one of the “Best in the West.” <strong>Kiplinger’s Personal Finance lists Westmont among the top 100 liberal arts colleges that provide high-quality academics at a reasonable cost</strong>. In addition, Westmont has gained an outstanding reputation with graduate schools and employers.</p>

    </div> 
    <div class="bit-60"> 
     <p>Our superior academic programs, first-rate faculty and Christian community will equip you with the experience and character you need to thrive in any profession. <strong>A liberal arts education provides excellent preparation for a career</strong> because it teaches you how to learn, how to think critically and how to communicate well. According to the U.S Department of Education, you will likely change jobs 14–18 times in the future with one to two international assignments. Given the complexity of life in the 21st century and the global economy, you will need the capacity to adjust intellectually and emotionally to new fields, environments and cultures.</p> 
     <p> <i>New York Times</i> columnist <strong>Thomas Friedman</strong> writes in the latest edition of <i>The World Is Flat</i>, “The liberal arts are more important than ever... [O]ur secret sauce comes from our ability to integrate art, science, music, and literature with the hard sciences. That’s what produces an iPod revolution or a Google.” Friedman spoke at the Westmont President’s Breakfast and on campus in 2007.</p>

     <h2>Applying for Financial Aid</h2> 
     <p>Take it step by step; four easy steps to applying for financial aid.</p> 
     <ul class="numbered"> 
      <li><span class="list-number">1</span> <strong>Apply to Westmont (November 15, Early Action deadline; February 15, Regular Decision deadline)</strong>. You may also wish to attend college fairs or financial aid workshops in your area to gain additional information about community-based scholarships and financial aid.</li> 
      <li><span class="list-number">2</span> <strong>Complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</strong>, available online at <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov" target="_blank" class="maroon"> www.fafsa.ed.gov</a>, as soon as possible after January 1, but no later than Westmont’s Priority deadline of March 2. Complete it accurately and promptly, because the FAFSA is the key to receiving financial aid. The Westmont code (which you will need to have your FAFSA information forwarded to us) is 001341. In March, all admitted students who have submitted their FAFSA (fafsa.ed.gov) information to Westmont receive an email with instructions on how to view their financial aid award.</li> 
      <li><span class="list-number">3</span> If you live in California, graduate from a California high school and wish to apply for the Cal Grant A or B for the first time, you must <strong>file the GPA verification form (available from your guidance office or career center) by March 2</strong>.</li> 
      <li><span class="list-number">4</span> Westmont will begin notifying admitted applicants of their financial aid offers in mid to late March. We send an electronic notification via email. Admitted students will receive specific instructions regarding access to their awards. <strong>All students have until May 1, the National Candidates Reply Date, to let us know if they decide to enroll.</strong> We may hold confirmation deposits postmarked after May 1 on a space-available basis.</li>
