     <title>Seafloor holds 15 million years of monsoon history</title>

       &lt;a href="/articles/2015/02/monsoons"&gt;&lt;img src="https://news.brown.edu/files/styles/teaser/public/article_images/Monsoon1p.jpg?itok=MGHXmHDi" width="221" height="92" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Clues about rainfall in the distant past — from river mud to tiny seashells — come to rest on the ocean floor. Sampling layers of sediment from the Indian Ocean will help researchers build an accurate picture of Indian monsoon activity going back 15 million years or more.

     <title>Mutation may cause early loss of sperm supply</title> 
     <link>https://news.brown.edu/articles/2015/03/sperm 
     <description>
       &lt;a href="/articles/2015/03/sperm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://news.brown.edu/files/styles/teaser/public/article_images/Sperm1_1.jpg?itok=F5_oycZo" width="221" height="126" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Problems in a gene responsible for producing the protein TAF4b leave mice — and maybe men — unable to sustain sperm production. As embryos, mice lacking the protein failed to develop an adequate number of key cells in the sperm production process and as adults they quickly lost their initial fertility.

     <title>‘Ecosystem services’ help assess ocean energy development</title> 
     <link>https://news.brown.edu/articles/2015/02/tidal 
     <description>
       &lt;a href="/articles/2015/02/tidal"&gt;&lt;img src="https://news.brown.edu/files/styles/teaser/public/article_images/Tidal2.jpg?itok=PqzFzwll" width="221" height="145" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In a new paper, Brown University environmental scientists suggest that the way to fill vast gaps in knowledge about the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of ocean energy development is to consider how the benefits provided by ocean ecosystems change before and after the placement of ocean energy infrastructure. The authors examine the case of Muskeget Channel in Massachusetts as an example.

       Commentary: Eli Adashi &lt;a href="/articles/2015/02/shooters"&gt;&lt;img src="https://news.brown.edu/files/styles/teaser/public/article_images/Shooters_0.jpg?itok=VfRBH1S-" width="221" height="184" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The number of active shooter incidents in U.S. hospitals has increased over the last decade to a frequency of more than one a month. In a new Viewpoint in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, authors suggest that hospitals examine their security plans.

     <title>Tadpole model links drug exposure to autism-like effects</title> 
     <link>https://news.brown.edu/articles/2015/02/tadpoles 
     <description>
       &lt;a href="/articles/2015/02/tadpoles"&gt;&lt;img src="https://news.brown.edu/files/styles/teaser/public/article_images/Tadpoles1p.jpg?itok=U-wxnv_c" width="221" height="88" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In utero exposure to the epilepsy drug VPA appears to elevate the risk to babies of developing an autism spectrum disorder. A new Brown University study used a tadpole model to investigate VPA’s effects on developing neural physiology and behavior. Researchers now hope to use the model to develop an intervention and to learn more about the underlying causes of neurodevelopmental disorders more broadly.
