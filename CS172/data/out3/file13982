   <p>PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT (THE <b>“TERMS”</b>) CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER WEBSITES OF INSTRUCTURE, INC. (<b>“INSTRUCTURE”</b>) WITH LINKS TO THIS AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE <b>“WEBSITE”</b>) IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING USING THE SERVICES ENABLED VIA THE WEBSITE (THE “SERVICES”) BY INSTRUCTURE OR USERS OF THE SITE (<b>“USERS”</b>), CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” CHECK BOX, OR MERELY BROWSING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS. IF YOU ARE AN ADMINISTRATOR (AS DEFINED BELOW) YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE TERMS PERSONALLY AND ON BEHALF OF THE ENTITY OR ORGANIZATION THAT EMPLOYS YOU, AND TO BIND THAT ENTITY TO THE TERMS, AND AGREE THAT THE TERM “YOU” ALSO REFERS TO SUCH ENTITY. <b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES.</b></p>

Instructure provides Entities with an administrator account that enables a designated Entity employee (<b>“Administrator”</b>) to manage the Services and manage Student and Instructor access to the Services. <b>“User”</b> means any user of the Service, including Administrators, Students, and Instructors. If you are an Administrator accessing the Service pursuant to a separate agreement (<b>“Entity Agreement”</b>) between your Entity and Instructure, the terms of your Entity Agreement applies to your use of the Service to the extent that the Entity Agreement conflicts with the Terms (including any changes to the Terms).</p> 
   <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY INSTRUCTURE IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AT ANY TIME. When changes are made, Instructure will make a new copy of the Terms available at the Website. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms. If we make any material changes, and you have registered to use the Services, we will also send an e-mail to you at the last e-mail address you provided to us pursuant to the Terms. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new Users of the Website or Services and will be effective thirty (30) days after posting of notice of such changes on the Website for existing User. Instructure may require you to provide consent to the updated Terms in a specified manner before further use of the Website or the Services is permitted. If you do not agree to any change(s) after receiving a notice of such change(s), you shall stop using the Website and/or the Services. Otherwise, your continued use of the Website and/or Services constitutes your acceptance of such change(s). PLEASE REGULARLY CHECK THE WEBSITE TO VIEW THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS.</p> 
   <h3>Use of the Services and Instructure Properties.</h3> 
   <p>The Website, the Services, and the information and content (<b>“Content”</b>) made available by Instructure on the Website and in the Services (collectively, the <b>“Instructure Properties”</b>) are protected by copyright laws throughout the world. Subject to the Terms, Instructure grants you a limited license to reproduce portions of the Instructure Properties for the sole purpose of using the Services for your personal purposes or, in the event you are an Administrator or Instructor User, your Entity’s educational or business purposes.</p> 
   <p><b>Application License.</b> Instructure also provides a mobile application (the <b>“Application”</b>) for use with the Services. Your use of the Application is governed by the End User License Agreement that accompanies the Application in the marketplace where you download it.</p>

Any future release, update or other addition to the Instructure Properties shall be subject to the Terms. Instructure, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Terms. Any unauthorized use of the Instructure Properties terminates the licenses granted by Instructure pursuant to the Terms.</p>

Contact information for Instructure’s Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement is as follows: Howard Baik; 6330 South 3000 East, Suite 700, Salt Lake City, UT 84121; <a href="mailto:legal@instructure.com" target="_blank">legal@instructure.com</a>.</p> 
   <h3>Term and Termination.</h3> 
   <p><b>Term.</b> The Terms commence on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use the Instructure Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Terms.</p> 
   <p><b>Termination of Services by Instructure.</b> If you have materially breached any provision of the Terms, or if Instructure is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Website, the Application, or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Instructure has the right to immediately suspend any Services and licenses provided to you under this Agreement (<b>“Suspension”</b>). Following Suspension, Instructure and your applicable entity will work together in good faith to determine whether to reinstate your access to (and any associated licenses to) the Services or permanently terminate your Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Instructure may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion in the event that (a) you are a repeat infringer for purposes of Instructure’s copyright infringement policy as described in Section 11 or (b) you violate any restriction of these Terms after Instructure makes reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of a previous violation. You agree that Instructure shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any Suspension or termination of your Account made in accordance with the Terms. Termination or Suspension of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service. Termination of all Services also may include deletion of your password and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof), including Your Content. Upon termination or Suspension of any Service, your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. Instructure will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any Suspension or termination, including for deletion of Your Content. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of Services, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.</p> 
   <h3>General Provisions.</h3> 
   <p><b>Compliance with Export Control and Sanctions Laws.</b> You agree that you will use the Website and Services in compliance with all export control laws, restrictions and regulations of the United States and all other relevant countries. You further agree not to export, or allow the export or re-export of Content, Your Content, or User Content (including any software, technical data, or any direct product thereof): (i) in violation of any applicable export control laws, restrictions, or regulations, including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.</p> 
   <p><b>Assignment.</b> The Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Instructure’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Instructure may assign this Agreement without your consent.</p> 
   <p><b>Force Majeure.</b> Instructure shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p> 
   <p><b>Compliance.</b> If you believe that Instructure has not adhered to the Terms, please contact Instructure by emailing us at <a href="mailto:legal@instructure.com" target="_blank">legal@instructure.com</a>. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation.</p> 
   <p><b>Governing Law.</b> The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of Utah, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. You hereby expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state of Utah for any lawsuit filed there against you by Instructure arising from or related to the Terms. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Terms. The laws of the jurisdiction where you are located may be different from Utah law.</p> 
   <p><b>Notice.</b> Where Instructure requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Instructure with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Instructure is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Terms, Instructure’s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Instructure at the following address: 6330 South 3000 East, Suite 700, Salt Lake City, UT 84121. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Instructure by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.</p> 
   <p><b>Waiver.</b> Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p> 
   <p><b>Severability.</b> If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p> 
   <p><b>Entire Agreement.</b> Unless you have entered into a separate Entity Agreement, the Terms are the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter.</p>
