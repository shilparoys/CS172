Constantly connect the dots.<\/h2>\r\n<p><b><\/b>Great innovators have the habit of constantly contemplating and observing in order to connect seemingly unrelated issues and ideas. When you connect the dots, you gain new insight and see relationships that were invisible before.<\/p>\r\n<h2>2. Commit to asking questions.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Great innovators have the habit of curiosity. Constantly ask questions--even about things you think you know. By asking new questions you challenge the knowledge you already have and get new perspective. The hardest part of establishing this habit is not the search for answers, but in coming up with great questions that lead you to revealing answers.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>3. Actively try new things.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Great innovators have the habit of actively trying out new ideas by creating prototypes and launching pilots. Think of Edison, who said, \"I haven't failed. I've simply found 10,000 ways that do not work.\" The real voyage of innovation is not in seeking new horizons but seeing the horizon in a new light.<\/p>\r\n<h2>4. Find points of intersection with others.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Great innovators have the habit of finding and testing new ideas through a network of people and organizations. Innovation is something that happens when we intersect with others. For ideas to germinate and for innovation to happen, a diverse set of perspectives, thinkers, questioners, and doers is required.<\/p>\r\n<h2>5. Have a sense of purpose.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Great innovators have the habit of being powered by their passion and using it as a sense of purpose. Their purpose is to make an impact and a difference. So they are not satisfied with what is, and they don't ask permission to change the status quo. They are driven by their sense of purpose.<\/p>\r\n<h2>6. Cross-pollinate ideas.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Great innovators have the habit of combining surprising things. Creativity happens when two things collide to create a whole new idea, and insight requires that we solve challenges with new perspective. That happens best when you work with those outside your industry or field.<\/p>\r\n<h2>7. Make innovation a daily routine.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Great innovators have the habit of learning and innovating. It's not something they do by accident, but through a daily ritual of exploration and trying new things. If we want to become a master of anything, it takes discipline and commitment. Innovators make growth and learning part of their work, rather than rely on it to come to them.<\/p>\r\n<p>Adopting these seven habits will boost your level of learning and creativity--which, in turn, leads to innovation and change.<\/p>\r\n<p>Every innovator, creator, leader, and business wants to know that it is creating an impact and is challenging the status quo to make things better.<\/p>\r\n<p>Where can your spirit of innovation take you?<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","inc_pubdate":"2014-09-08 07:00:00","inc_promo_date":"2014-09-08 07:00:00","inc_custom_pubdate":null,"inc_show_feature_imageflag":true,"inc_image_caption_override":null,"inc_autid":3723,"inc_typid":1,"inc_staid":7,"inc_serid":null,"inc_prtid":null,"inc_activeflag":true,"inc_copyeditedflag":true,"inc_filelocation":"lolly-daskal\/the-seven-habits-of-successful-innovators.html","inc_hide_commentsflag":false,"inc_hide_article_sidebarflag":false,"inc_custom_sidebar":null,"id":61485,"channels":[{"id":7,"cnl_name":"Innovate","cnl_filelocation":"innovate","cnl_custom_color":"9DC786","cnl_calculated_color":null,"sortorder":0},{"id":6,"cnl_name":"Grow","cnl_filelocation":"grow","cnl_custom_color":"F6861F","cnl_calculated_color":null,"sortorder":1},{"id":383,"cnl_name":"Big Ideas","cnl_filelocation":"big-ideas","cnl_custom_color":null,"cnl_calculated_color":"9DC786","sortorder":2},{"id":417,"cnl_name":"Decision-Making","cnl_filelocation":"decision-making","cnl_custom_color":null,"cnl_calculated_color":"009CD8","sortorder":3}],"authors":[{"aut_name":"Lolly Daskal","aut_last_name_for_sort":null,"aut_title":null,"aut_column_name":null,"aut_imgid":"38304","aut_blurb":"<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lollydaskal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lolly Daskal<\/a><\/strong> is the president and CEO of <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lollydaskal.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lead From Within<\/a><\/strong>, a global consultancy that specializes in leadership and entrepreneurial development.

They <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/jessica-stillman\/why-you-should-keep-a-work-journal.html\">reflect<\/a>.<\/h2>\n<p>Accomplishing your top goals will require you to reflect upon where you have been, where you are, as well as where you are going. Successful individuals build quiet time in and use solitude to do this first thing in the morning. They'll ask themselves: <em>What did I achieve toward&nbsp;my goals thus far this week--or the past week?<\/em><em>What's the status of my present projects?<\/em>&nbsp;<em>What will I have to achieve today in light of this?<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. They make themselves comfortable.<\/h2>\n<p>Successful individuals take time at the start of the workday to be certain their chair is properly adjusted and the objects they access frequently--phone, keyboard, computer mouse--are all within comfortable reach. Make sure you have the right lighting. Your day is going to go well if you create an ergonomic environment that is functional.<\/p>\n<h2>3. They review their to-do list and make necessary adjustments.<\/h2>\n<p>This assists them in remembering the necessity of sticking with the plan and concentrating&nbsp;on the tasks that are truly important, not just urgent. Taking a mental note of the day also assists successful people in visualizing success, tremendously boosting confidence levels. Also, it can help you see&nbsp;where potential challenges might lie with how you have scheduled the day, in order for you to make the needed changes.<\/p>\n<h2>4. They prioritize.<\/h2>\n<p>A positive result of some big-picture reflection includes the capability of better prioritizing your to-do&nbsp;tasks. Go above and beyond merely creating a list&nbsp;and challenge yourself to develop a realistic hierarchy for your tasks.<\/p>\n<h2>5. They take the time to greet the team.<\/h2>\n<p>This is especially crucial if you're a leader. However, no matter what role you are in, it is critical. Checking in and visiting with your team and boss will assist you and other people in kickstarting their day. In order to advance your career, you cannot skimp on people skills. You may be the most technically savvy individual inside the room, yet your attitude might amplify or chip away at your technical skills value. Being friendly the first thing in your morning will make the work environment more pleasant for everybody--and that humanistic approach is going to be contagious.<\/p>\n<h2>6. They'll take a temperature read of co-workers\/staff.<\/h2>\n<p>A strong manager takes a minute in the morning to briefly talk to his or her staff to make sure they seem motivated and engaged. At one glance, these savvy experts often can get a cursory reading of the job satisfaction and energy level of their team. If things seem awry, they're better dealt with later in the day.<\/p>\n<h2>7. They'll organize their workspace.<\/h2>\n<p>Not having the ability to locate things is a big office time waster. Therefore, while you might pride yourself on hopping into the fray without any down time, clutter is going to catch up to you. Facing a clean slate on your desktop is going to better clear your mind for that day's projects.<\/p>\n<h2>8. They strategically check their email.<\/h2>\n<p>The emphasis is on \"strategically,\" because email can quickly become a time-wasting distraction. Checking your email may become one of those activities which makes it feel like you're achieving things, but it creates the risk that you aren't attending to priority items and are allowing other people to set your schedule.<\/p>\n<h2>9. They avoid and anticipate distractions.<\/h2>\n<p>All of us face some of the exact same distractions at the beginning of the&nbsp;day. Successful business people know how they can mitigate these distractions to maximize their initial&nbsp;minutes at their office.

They <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/jessica-stillman\/why-you-should-keep-a-work-journal.html\">reflect<\/a>.<\/h2>\n<p>Accomplishing your top goals will require you to reflect upon where you have been, where you are, as well as where you are going. Successful individuals build quiet time in and use solitude to do this first thing in the morning. They'll ask themselves: <em>What did I achieve toward&nbsp;my goals thus far this week--or the past week?<\/em><em>What's the status of my present projects?<\/em>&nbsp;<em>What will I have to achieve today in light of this?<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2. They make themselves comfortable.<\/h2>\n<p>Successful individuals take time at the start of the workday to be certain their chair is properly adjusted and the objects they access frequently--phone, keyboard, computer mouse--are all within comfortable reach. Make sure you have the right lighting. Your day is going to go well if you create an ergonomic environment that is functional.<\/p>\n<h2>3. They review their to-do list and make necessary adjustments.<\/h2>\n<p>This assists them in remembering the necessity of sticking with the plan and concentrating&nbsp;on the tasks that are truly important, not just urgent. Taking a mental note of the day also assists successful people in visualizing success, tremendously boosting confidence levels. Also, it can help you see&nbsp;where potential challenges might lie with how you have scheduled the day, in order for you to make the needed changes.<\/p>\n<h2>4. They prioritize.<\/h2>\n<p>A positive result of some big-picture reflection includes the capability of better prioritizing your to-do&nbsp;tasks. Go above and beyond merely creating a list&nbsp;and challenge yourself to develop a realistic hierarchy for your tasks.<\/p>\n<h2>5. They take the time to greet the team.<\/h2>\n<p>This is especially crucial if you're a leader. However, no matter what role you are in, it is critical. Checking in and visiting with your team and boss will assist you and other people in kickstarting their day. In order to advance your career, you cannot skimp on people skills. You may be the most technically savvy individual inside the room, yet your attitude might amplify or chip away at your technical skills value. Being friendly the first thing in your morning will make the work environment more pleasant for everybody--and that humanistic approach is going to be contagious.<\/p>\n<h2>6. They'll take a temperature read of co-workers\/staff.<\/h2>\n<p>A strong manager takes a minute in the morning to briefly talk to his or her staff to make sure they seem motivated and engaged. At one glance, these savvy experts often can get a cursory reading of the job satisfaction and energy level of their team. If things seem awry, they're better dealt with later in the day.<\/p>\n<h2>7. They'll organize their workspace.<\/h2>\n<p>Not having the ability to locate things is a big office time waster. Therefore, while you might pride yourself on hopping into the fray without any down time, clutter is going to catch up to you. Facing a clean slate on your desktop is going to better clear your mind for that day's projects.<\/p>\n<h2>8. They strategically check their email.<\/h2>\n<p>The emphasis is on \"strategically,\" because email can quickly become a time-wasting distraction. Checking your email may become one of those activities which makes it feel like you're achieving things, but it creates the risk that you aren't attending to priority items and are allowing other people to set your schedule.<\/p>\n<h2>9. They avoid and anticipate distractions.<\/h2>\n<p>All of us face some of the exact same distractions at the beginning of the&nbsp;day. Successful business people know how they can mitigate these distractions to maximize their initial&nbsp;minutes at their office. The distractions&nbsp;might involve unneeded meetings, low-priority calls, chatty co-workers, social media, incoming texts or emails, or other unimportant&nbsp;alerts--all of which will challenge you to concentrate on your day's strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>10. They take time to be grateful.<\/h2>\n<p>One excellent way that successful individuals begin their day includes identifying something they are grateful for, and it might be business-related or personal. It is motivational and will remind them to put small tasks in perspective.<\/p>","adinfo":{"c_type":"article","showlogo":true,"cms":"inc70448","video":"no","aut":["murray-newlands"],"channelArray":{"topid":"280","topfilelocation":"productivity","primary":["lead","lead"],"primaryFilelocation":["lead","lead"],"primaryname":["Lead","Lead"],"sub":["inclife","people","lead","productivity"],"subFilelocation":["theinclife","people","lead","productivity"],"subname":["The Inc.

Embrace the day full on<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Like most days, I wake up Monday mornings by 5:30 a.m. I start the day by keeping up with current events through Flipboard--usually honing in on news relevant to my industry. I have to admit, I'm sometimes checking email around this time as well. But then I have some quiet reflection time for a solid 20 minutes and with no distractions. There's a rigorous workout, typically a mix of boxing and running, for the remaining hour, and by 7:00 a.m., I'll have breakfast ready for my sons, which is also when I get the rundown on what's going on at their schools. As we head out for the day, I'll take the train into work, while I communicate with our teams across the globe. This is a time to get a pulse on the latest work and market movements, because, depending on where they are in the world, they may be closing out or starting their day as well.\"<em>--Carey Kolaja, vice president and head of global consumer products at <a href=\"http:\/\/paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>2. Plan for success<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"My son Cole is big a priority during the weekend, so Monday mornings begin early, at 5 a.m., with a focus on work. I start with a massive download of weekend email and news headlines, reading <em>The New York Times<\/em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em>, and <em>San Francisco Chronicle<\/em> first thing, along with industry news aggregators that align with specific clients. It's important for body to follow mind, so I take a break at a nearby gym for a 6 a.m. spin class and am back home by 7 a.m., making sure Cole has breakfast before eating my own breakfast of champions--homemade granola, blueberries, and plain nonfat yogurt. I drop Cole off for the school bus and then dress for the day with an eye towards in-person meetings; urban hipster for tech clients, more conservative for others. I'm in the car by 8 a.m. for (hands-free!) conference calls on the way to the office, doing my best to keep all in-person meetings from 9 a.m. onwards.\"<em>--Teresa Briggs, west region managing partner at <a href=\"http:\/\/deloitte.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Deloitte<\/a> <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>3. Come prepared<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"A successful Monday morning actually starts on Sunday night. I get the house straight, since messy surroundings lead to a messy mind. I review my week: Important meetings. Schedules. Evening obligations. Travel. I think about where things are going to go awry, where I'm going to get exhausted or hit the wall, and I plan for them. I make sure my bag is stocked with the essentials--power bars, charger, ChapStick, sometimes an extra pair of shoes, if I have an evening event where I know my feet will hurt. I pack my gym bag with the next day's clothes and my laptop bag. I have a bottle of water with me at all times.\"<em>--Gretchen Curtis, co-founder and CMO at <a href=\"http:\/\/pistoncloud.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Piston Cloud Computing<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>4. Start your Monday on Sunday<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"My Monday starts on Sunday evening, so I can hit the ground running on Monday. Organization is key, since each Monday starts with a 6:30 a.m. meeting with sales that helps me stay grounded around what sales needs and needs to know. I am an outdoor person, and since I can't bring my meetings outside, I bring in fresh flowers every Monday. Finally, I make a list of all my 'big boulder' priorities and the important 'little pebble'&nbsp;priorities that keep the trains running on time.\"<em>--Janet Matsuda, senior vice president of global marketing at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluecoat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Coat Systems<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>5. Always walk to work<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"8 a.m.: I have always chosen to live close to work so that I can manage my commute free of stress. Because walking is more predictable than driving or taking public transportation, it's easier for me to be punctual and manage my time. With walking, there is no waiting for a car to arrive or for a stalled subway, no unforeseen traffic or sudden delays. I know my walk to the office is exactly 34 minutes from my apartment--the perfect amount of time to call my best friend in New York or my parents, or simply think. A walking commute removes unnecessary stress and helps me start my day in a composed and deliberate way. I am able to enter the office, prepared with a clear head, ready for whatever lies ahead.\"<em>--Christina LaMontagne, general manager and founder of health at <a href=\"http:\/\/nerdwallet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">NerdWallet<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>6. Plan how you will focus<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Preparing for Monday's madness begins Sunday night with a yoga class, a hot bath, and turning in extra early so that I wake up refreshed and energized. After nine sun salutations, 24 minutes of mediation, and a protein shake, I head to the gym. I like to lift heavy weights on Mondays. When I'm trying to deadlift my bodyweight or perform a clean to overhead press, I feel 100 percent&nbsp;focused, driven, and alive. When I get to the office, I reevaluate my priorities with that same presence, strength, and resilience, and start the week with a sense of optimism and accomplishment.\"<em>--Dara Sklar, senior vice president at <a href=\"http:\/\/mslgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">MSLGROUP<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>7. Swim to think<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Monday morning I am recharged and ready to go. Up early, grind the beans, and make a French press of Illy coffee while talking with our dogs and checking my email.&nbsp;Then, I drive to a dawn swim for 45 mins. Swimming outside (all year round in California) and&nbsp;watching the sun come up as I swim makes me see the world as new and full of possibilities. And I do some of my best thinking doing laps. Quick shower, into the office, and I'm pumped to talk with my staff about the challenges of the week.\"<em>--Penny Herscher, president and CEO at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstrain.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">FirstRain<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>8. Prioritize with intent<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Mondays generally start as a centering exercise. After completing my early morning routine as a mother and family member, I transition to my professional role. Being a morning person, I typically start out with a burst of energy and accomplish what I see as a 'head start'&nbsp;on the workweek. I take the time to ensure my commitments are on-track and contemplate how certain project elements will contribute to the overall corporate objectives. With these areas reviewed, each Monday I draft a new priority list, so that my approach to the week is crafted. Where busy schedules often collide, establishing an element of order&nbsp;is a good way to maintain a sense of direction and progress. An evolving task list helps with the dynamic pace that is characteristic of a medical device startup company, where the days and deliverables can be intense with unexpected learning curves. Through the application of my Monday morning routine, I am able to quickly re-engage.\"<em>--Tanya Eberle, director of regulatory affairs, <a href=\"http:\/\/cartiva.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cartiva<\/a><\/em><\/p>","inc_pubdate":"2015-02-26 05:45:00","inc_promo_date":"2015-02-26 08:00:00","inc_custom_pubdate":null,"inc_show_feature_imageflag":true,"inc_image_caption_override":null,"inc_autid":null,"inc_typid":1,"inc_staid":7,"inc_serid":null,"inc_prtid":null,"inc_activeflag":true,"inc_copyeditedflag":true,"inc_filelocation":"john-brandon\/women-tech-leaders-share-their-monday-morning-ritual.html","inc_hide_commentsflag":false,"inc_hide_article_sidebarflag":false,"inc_custom_sidebar":null,"id":70799,"channels":[{"id":468,"cnl_name":"The Inc.

Always walk to work<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"8 a.m.: I have always chosen to live close to work so that I can manage my commute free of stress. Because walking is more predictable than driving or taking public transportation, it's easier for me to be punctual and manage my time. With walking, there is no waiting for a car to arrive or for a stalled subway, no unforeseen traffic or sudden delays. I know my walk to the office is exactly 34 minutes from my apartment--the perfect amount of time to call my best friend in New York or my parents, or simply think. A walking commute removes unnecessary stress and helps me start my day in a composed and deliberate way. I am able to enter the office, prepared with a clear head, ready for whatever lies ahead.\"<em>--Christina LaMontagne, general manager and founder of health at <a href=\"http:\/\/nerdwallet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">NerdWallet<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>6. Plan how you will focus<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Preparing for Monday's madness begins Sunday night with a yoga class, a hot bath, and turning in extra early so that I wake up refreshed and energized. After nine sun salutations, 24 minutes of mediation, and a protein shake, I head to the gym. I like to lift heavy weights on Mondays. When I'm trying to deadlift my bodyweight or perform a clean to overhead press, I feel 100 percent&nbsp;focused, driven, and alive. When I get to the office, I reevaluate my priorities with that same presence, strength, and resilience, and start the week with a sense of optimism and accomplishment.\"<em>--Dara Sklar, senior vice president at <a href=\"http:\/\/mslgroup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">MSLGROUP<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>7. Swim to think<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Monday morning I am recharged and ready to go. Up early, grind the beans, and make a French press of Illy coffee while talking with our dogs and checking my email.&nbsp;Then, I drive to a dawn swim for 45 mins. Swimming outside (all year round in California) and&nbsp;watching the sun come up as I swim makes me see the world as new and full of possibilities. And I do some of my best thinking doing laps. Quick shower, into the office, and I'm pumped to talk with my staff about the challenges of the week.\"<em>--Penny Herscher, president and CEO at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.firstrain.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">FirstRain<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n<h2>8. Prioritize with intent<\/h2>\r\n<p>\"Mondays generally start as a centering exercise. After completing my early morning routine as a mother and family member, I transition to my professional role. Being a morning person, I typically start out with a burst of energy and accomplish what I see as a 'head start'&nbsp;on the workweek. I take the time to ensure my commitments are on-track and contemplate how certain project elements will contribute to the overall corporate objectives. With these areas reviewed, each Monday I draft a new priority list, so that my approach to the week is crafted. Where busy schedules often collide, establishing an element of order&nbsp;is a good way to maintain a sense of direction and progress. An evolving task list helps with the dynamic pace that is characteristic of a medical device startup company, where the days and deliverables can be intense with unexpected learning curves. Through the application of my Monday morning routine, I am able to quickly re-engage.\"<em>--Tanya Eberle, director of regulatory affairs, <a href=\"http:\/\/cartiva.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cartiva<\/a><\/em><\/p>","adinfo":{"c_type":"formattedarticle","showlogo":true,"cms":"inc70799","video":"yes","aut":["john-brandon"],"channelArray":{"topid":"468","topfilelocation":"theinclife","primary":["lead","lead"],"primaryFilelocation":["lead","lead"],"primaryname":["Lead","Lead"],"sub":["womenbiz","people","inclife"],"subFilelocation":["women-in-business","people","theinclife"],"subname":["Women Entrepreneurs","People","The Inc.

We were competing with a company that had been talking to this customer for a year, and we had only been speaking with them for three months. When I asked why the company went with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/alumnify.co\" target=\"_blank\">Alumnify<\/a>, they said it was because of how I responded to an email.<\/p>\n<p>The email was informing both us and our competitor that they were deciding between the two of us. While our competitor responded negatively, we took a different approach. I wrote back:&nbsp;\"That's great to hear. A little competition never hurt nobody. :)\"<br>I then went to my team and explained the situation. But the difference is, we remained positive, and the attitude pushed us to move fast and to keep building. We acted like we had already won the competition, and just kept developing their product. By the time the final decision was made, we had blown past our competitor.<\/p>\n<p>We weren't better equipped or more talented. All we did was stay positive through the situation, and it led us to winning the deal. People want to work with companies who are confident and upbeat. Keeping this in mind will separate your startup from the others who allow negativity to seep through.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Team Camaraderie<\/h2>\n<p>An improvement I started making with my team is catching myself when I start complaining or have negative thoughts. Data suggests that when employees are happy, they produce better work. As leaders, it's essential that we keep this in mind.<\/p>\n<p>When someone messes up, don't bring down the person, just change the process. It's amazing to see how much a company culture is built off the attitude of the leader. When the captain is in a bad mood, the entire crew suffers. While this cripples companies that have angry bosses, it is a weapon for those who can remain optimistic. Be the example of the positivity you want to see in your team, and watch productivity increase dramatically.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Self-Improvement<\/h2>\n<p>I'm one of the most physically inflexible people you'll ever meet. So when I started doing yoga, you can imagine my frustrations. Here I am&nbsp;next to a person in a pretzel, and I'm trying to touch my ankles. It's an interesting sight, to say the least.<\/p>\n<p>One day in yoga class when I was noticeably angry, my instructor smiled and said \"Breathe and smile.\" Smiling has been proven to raise our spirits, so I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, my body relaxed and I was able to reach farther than I ever had before.<\/p>\n<p>We all have personal goals in our life. And while it's easy to look at someone else and want to mimic them, we all have our own limitations. Remaining optimistic will allow you to ignore distractions and focus on your individual journey. Day by day, you will get closer and closer to your goal. Remember, the happier you are, the more you will get done. Eventually, you'll reach your goal. Where the negative give up, the positive push forward.<\/p>","inc_pubdate":"2015-02-25 00:05:00","inc_promo_date":"2015-02-25 00:05:00","inc_custom_pubdate":null,"inc_show_feature_imageflag":true,"inc_image_caption_override":null,"inc_autid":null,"inc_typid":1,"inc_staid":7,"inc_serid":null,"inc_prtid":null,"inc_activeflag":true,"inc_copyeditedflag":true,"inc_filelocation":"aj-agrawal\/why-being-positive-is-the-best-tool-in-business.html","inc_hide_commentsflag":false,"inc_hide_article_sidebarflag":false,"inc_custom_sidebar":null,"id":70790,"channels":[{"id":4,"cnl_name":"Lead","cnl_filelocation":"lead","cnl_custom_color":"009CD8","cnl_calculated_color":"F7CE00","sortorder":0},{"id":167,"cnl_name":"Team Building","cnl_filelocation":"team-building","cnl_custom_color":null,"cnl_calculated_color":"FB433A","sortorder":1},{"id":281,"cnl_name":"Coping With Failure","cnl_filelocation":"coping-with-failure","cnl_custom_color":null,"cnl_calculated_color":"009CD8","sortorder":2},{"id":417,"cnl_name":"Decision-Making","cnl_filelocation":"decision-making","cnl_custom_color":null,"cnl_calculated_color":"009CD8","sortorder":3},{"id":468,"cnl_name":"The Inc.

This held true regardless of the age of the person being tested.<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway, the post goes on to say, is simple and easily actionable: \"The next time you find yourself <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inc.com\/jessica-stillman\/a-better-way-to-make-hard-choices.html\">dealing with a personal dilemma<\/a>, maximize your wise reasoning skills by taking a step back and thinking about your problem the way an outsider would.\"<\/p>","adinfo":{"c_type":"article","showlogo":true,"cms":"inc70794","video":"no","aut":["jessica-stillman"],"channelArray":{"topid":"417","topfilelocation":"decision__making","primary":["lead"],"primaryFilelocation":["lead"],"primaryname":["Lead"],"sub":["decision"],"subFilelocation":["decision-making"],"subname":["Decision-Making"]},"adzone":"\/4160\/mv.inc\/lead\/decision\/decision"},"commentcount":2},{"inc_headline":"11 Inspiring People Who Lost It All and Came Back Stronger","inc_homepage_headline":"11 Inspiring People Who Lost It All and Came Back Stronger","inc_homepage_headline_ab_test":null,"inc_sharing_headline":"11 Inspiring People Who Lost It All and Came Back Stronger","inc_twitter_headline":"11 Inspiring People Who Lost It All & Came Back Stronger: @billmurphyjr @cyndilauper @dorothyhamill","inc_title":"11 Inspiring People Who Lost It All and Came Back Stronger","inc_custom_byline":null,"inc_deck":"When things go really badly, it's good to have a few examples of people who turned it all around.","inc_homepage_deck":"When things go really badly, it's good to have a few examples of people who turned it all around.","inc_sharing_deck":null,"inc_clean_text":"<p>I was talking with an old friend recently.

             <p>The biggest misconception about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inc.com/lolly-daskal/the-must-have-leadership-skills-to-succeed.html">success </a>is that what you did yesterday will help you succeed tomorrow.</p> 
             <p>To stay on top of your game, your business, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.inc.com/lolly-daskal/great-leadership-matters-in-any-business.html">your leadership,</a> you need to keep innovating.</p> 
             <p>To continue innovating you have to keep learning, thinking, <a href="http://www.inc.com/lolly-daskal/6-powerful-questions-successful-leaders-ask-themselves-daily.html%20">questioning,</a> exploring, experimenting, associating, and intersecting ideas.</p> 
             <p>Develop these habits to become more innovative:</p> 
             <h2>1. Constantly connect the dots.</h2> 
             <p><b></b>Great innovators have the habit of constantly contemplating and observing in order to connect seemingly unrelated issues and ideas. When you connect the dots, you gain new insight and see relationships that were invisible before.</p> 
             <h2>2. Commit to asking questions.</h2> 
             <p>Great innovators have the habit of curiosity. Constantly ask questions--even about things you think you know. By asking new questions you challenge the knowledge you already have and get new perspective. The hardest part of establishing this habit is not the search for answers, but in coming up with great questions that lead you to revealing answers.&nbsp;</p> 
             <h2>3. Actively try new things.</h2> 
             <p>Great innovators have the habit of actively trying out new ideas by creating prototypes and launching pilots. Think of Edison, who said, "I haven't failed. I've simply found 10,000 ways that do not work." The real voyage of innovation is not in seeking new horizons but seeing the horizon in a new light.</p> 
             <h2>4. Find points of intersection with others.</h2> 
             <p>Great innovators have the habit of finding and testing new ideas through a network of people and organizations. Innovation is something that happens when we intersect with others. For ideas to germinate and for innovation to happen, a diverse set of perspectives, thinkers, questioners, and doers is required.</p> 
             <h2>5. Have a sense of purpose.</h2> 
             <p>Great innovators have the habit of being powered by their passion and using it as a sense of purpose. Their purpose is to make an impact and a difference. So they are not satisfied with what is, and they don't ask permission to change the status quo. They are driven by their sense of purpose.</p> 
             <h2>6. Cross-pollinate ideas.</h2> 
             <p>Great innovators have the habit of combining surprising things. Creativity happens when two things collide to create a whole new idea, and insight requires that we solve challenges with new perspective. That happens best when you work with those outside your industry or field.</p> 
             <h2>7. Make innovation a daily routine.</h2> 
             <p>Great innovators have the habit of learning and innovating. It's not something they do by accident, but through a daily ritual of exploration and trying new things. If we want to become a master of anything, it takes discipline and commitment. Innovators make growth and learning part of their work, rather than rely on it to come to them.</p> 
             <p>Adopting these seven habits will boost your level of learning and creativity--which, in turn, leads to innovation and change.</p> 
             <p>Every innovator, creator, leader, and business wants to know that it is creating an impact and is challenging the status quo to make things better.</p> 
             <p>Where can your spirit of innovation take you?</p>
