              </blockquote> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><i>So, why might students want to be a part of this program? </i></b></font></p> 
              <ul> 
               <li class="style1">First of all, it will give students a chance to have some of their classes in small groups (the enrollment for Honors sections is capped at 20) and to be taking those classes with other serious students. <br> <br> </li> 
               <li class="style1">The classes are taught in a collaborative seminar style with faculty members who work closely with students. <br> <br> </li> 
               <li class="style1">The challenge and camaraderie of these classes enhance the experience at CCC and better prepares students to meet the demands of junior and senior level classes when they transfer to a four-year institution. <br> <br> </li> 
               <li class="style1">The Honors courses also might explore some themes that are different from the regular sections. For example: one of the Honors English Composition 1 classes had two themes - Self &amp; Society and War &amp; Its Consequences. The skills developed in this class would be the same as in any ENG 101, but the style of the class should be more interesting and more thought provoking.<br> <br> </li> 
               <li class="style1">Another advantage of the Honors Program is that it helps students in the following ways<br> as they prepare for transfer to a four-year college or university: there will be special advising sessions for students in the Honors Program; any Honors courses will be designated as such on your transcript; we have an informal articulation agreement with the Honors Program at Rutgers-Camden and with the Honors Program at Rowan University where students who complete our Honors Program are automatically accepted into theirs, and we have had students accepted into Honors Programs at other <br> 4-year schools like Arizona State, Villanova, Arcadia, Stockton and American University; as well as transfers to Wesleyan and the University of Pennsylvania. Finally, students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities which will enhance their application for admission and scholarships at four-year institutions.</li> 
              </ul> 
              <ul> 
               <li><span class="style1">There are several scholarship opportunities exclusively for Honors Program students.</span></li>
