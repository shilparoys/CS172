        Through Archaeology scholars reconstruct, examine, query and confront the record of past human-environment interactions. Placing these interactions in an historical context brings a long-term perspective to bear on contemporary issues. This course examines critically this record of human adaptations through time and across the globe with a particular focus on the ancient Americas. The view of archaeology is that the experiences of these ancient societies offer useful lessons about past choices which should affect the choices made today. 
        <br> Enrollment priority: Enrollment priority given to majors and minors in Anthropology and Environmental Studies and to Archaeology minors.

       <dd>
        Much of what we hear, read and see about Africa in literature, the media and even in academic writing emphasizes the suffering, corruption, disease, war and strife that afflict much of the continent. To be sure, Africa is plagued by many of these issues, often to a far greater extent than other parts of the world. However, the sameness of tone and pessimism in the coverage of these problems often belies the diversity of culture and experience that is the African continent-which includes 53 countries, hundreds of different ethnic groups and a vast array of traditions, practices and beliefs. This course will examine a selection of different African societies and states from across the continent with an emphasis on how perspectives and ideas about traditional culture and practice intersect with the challenges-economic, religious, ethnic and political -faced by African cultures and the modern African nation state. The goal of this course is that students will leave with an appreciation of the cultural richness and regional variation that is sometime hidden by the usual generalizations and sterotypes that are often applied to Africa.

        In this course students learn about the relationships between systems of production and distribution and the social and cultural contexts in which they occur. After discussing some important theoretical approaches that have influenced economic anthropologists over the years, we consider various ethnographic case studies that provide a more nuanced understanding of both the material and symbolic aspects of economic processes. Throughout the course, we pay close attention to the ways in which global economic processes are articulated, and made meaningful, at the local level. We also contemplate the relationships between global capitalism and pressing social problems, including hunger, gender inequities, poverty, war, and environmental degradation.

        This course will explore the history of architecture from the revival of the classical architectural treatise in the 15th century by Leon Battista Alberti through contemporary use of computer generated designs such as works by Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid's Bridge Pavillion, Zaragoza, Spain. (In 2004 Zaha Hadid was the first women to win the Pritzker Prize.) While we will explore some of the great monuments in the history of architecture such as Brunelleschi's dome of Florence Cathedral or Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum, discussing questions of design and technological innovation, we will also address broader questions surrounding the built environment as reflections of contemporary attitudes. Architecture, past and present, will be analyzed with respect to continuing ideals and contrasting innovations. We will also address issues such as sustainable and "green" architecture; the role of the female architect and the gendering of places and spaces; affordable housing; and the

How have these analytical and theoretical models been complicated and revised in light of key developments in the 20th century, from the rise of mass culture, the emergence of new technologies for the production and dissemination of culture, to more recent shifts in cultural production augmented by transformations in the global political economy?

What is the relationship between literary genre and the way humans frame their emotional, intellectual, and social experience?

        This course explores the various ways that texts "answer" each other or imbricate each other. Writers often compose a text in response to another work (sometimes contemporaneous, sometimes distant). Writers also develop rivalries, write for each other as audience, feel especially influenced by or even possessed by another writer. In some eras, all literature is considered to be "part" of a larger project or in response to a "big" text (e.g., the Bible). Some literary works are written in the shadow of another language. Different theories of intertextuality will be covered.

Because the 1960s saw big changes on the theatrical scene in Britain it is taken as a starting point, and we see what we can of the playwrights who helped form our present day theatre through the twentieth century. Because it does not operate in a vacuum, appropriate plays may be chosen from other periods and cultures that address crucial global, social and political issues.

Through Amy Levy (Reuben Sachs), Virginia Woolf (Mrs. Dalloway) and Jean Rhys (Good Morning, Midnight) we can explore the changing role of women in the metropolis. In Alexander Baron's The Lowlife we can glimpse the East End's historic importance as a home to refugees and see how it turned into Bangla Town in Monica Ali's Brick Lane. In Conrad we find London as the centre of Empire and in the work of Sam Selvon and Monica Ali we have examples of how the Empire has written back. By paying close attention to both text and context, we shall achieve a lively appreciation of the works in and of themselves and as part of the cultural life of London.

We will explore the dynamics of planet Earth through exploring many of the myths and misconceptions created by Hollywood movies. Using well?known films, we will learn about earthquakes, volcanoes, meteors, evolution, and climate. We will conclude by discussing how the public's perception of the environment and of scientists is influenced by the way the entertainment industry, news media, and the scientific community present geologic concepts

        Humans interact with the Earth in many ways: we use natural resources, experience natural hazards, and design geoengineering techniques that modify natural processes. In this course, we consider how a diversity of human activities affects our environment, and how a diversity of natural processes affects humans. These topics will help us delve into the meaning of "sustainability" from the perspective of Earth scientists. We will use the modern and historic New Jersey landscape as a case study, but we will also discuss topics such as mountaintop removal in the Appalachians, earthquakes in Indonesia, and water usage in the Western US. Students will learn basic Earth science concepts, techniques for field scientists, methods of data analysis and presentation, and skills for effectively teasing apart complex environmental issues.

We will then examine how these ideas became transformed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in movements and events as varied as romanticism, the Red Cross, colonialism, World War I, Pan-Arabism, and Wahhabism. All of these reimagined, idealized, and represented the medieval world (Latin or Arabic) so as to promote radically different agendas.

        Computational neuroscience is the study of the brain as a computational and information-processing organ. It is a highly interdisciplinary field that employs various ideas and techniques from physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and (of course) neuroscience. In this course, we cover the following topics: biophysics of a single neuron; dynamics of neural networks; models of associative memory and object recognition; and numerical methods and tools for analyzing and simulating a dynamical system. We study the fundamental biophysical properties and processes of the neurons and their networks, while also learning to use several analytical and numerical methods for studying a complex dynamical system. The goal of the course is to develop an interdisciplinary approach for analyzing a biological system.

        Policymakers are dependent on intelligence to help guide and inform their decision making. Indeed, intelligence provides a critical support role in all aspects of foreign policy and national security; it is often difficult to understand US actions without understanding not only the intelligence that was provided, but the process through which it came about. The purpose of this class is to provide students with an understanding of the roles and processes through which the intelligence community shapes national policy and the resulting impact on international relations in general. The course will not only address theoretical and practical bases and implications of intelligence, but will invite practitioners to discuss their experiences and their view of policy.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        This class examines how and why states have worked throughout history to wage both war and peace. Although it is often assumed that peace exists when there is an absence of war, closer inquiry shows that real peace is the product of effort and planning rather than a default status. Moreover, war is often not the result of purposeful policy, rather an accident of misperception, error, and ambiguity. The class will examine a wide variety of time periods, ranging from ancient Greece to current events in the Middle East, with special emphasis on understanding the objectives of and motivations for war as well as the requirements for peace. One question the class will pose is whether war leads to peace, as we might expect, or perhaps, paradoxically, whether peace can lead to war. It will also look at the contemporary challenge of terrorism and how that may change state behaviors.

        Torture has become a subject of much debate in the post-9/11 world. In this course, we start with this fascination with the subject to historically, philosophically, and conceptually analyze the debates on torture. The aim is to analyze the different dimensions of torture: its existence in different societies, its nature, its relationship with pain and truth, its impact, and finally the control of the state over bodies and lives in modern society.

        Wars and numerous peacemaking initiatives have affected the Middle East's socio-economic and political development. Why has this region been marred by wars? Is the lack of democratic structures or strong regional organizations built on neo-liberal principles the problem? Or is it the legacy of imperialism and the continued interference of the great powers? This course will provide answers to these questions by studying three conflicts: (1) the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians; (2) Lebanon's civil war (1975-1990); and (3) the U.S.-Iraq conflict (1991-present).

        This course examines approaches to maintaining international peace and security and how they may have changed in the twenty-first century. It addresses peacemaking in the context of both intra and interstate war, although it focuses particularly on the challenge of resolving civil conflict. Various approaches to mediation and their effectiveness will be addressed, as will the sustainability of negotiated versus military settlements and the effectiveness of peacekeeping and peace building. The course will also consider philosophical debates on the propriety of intervention in light of traditional norms of international relations, particularly sovereignty and noninterference, and the difficulty of reconciling humanitarian interests with the rules governing state behaviors.

This course introduces students to those debates via direct readings of major 20th century or contemporary political theorists. The course also includes various counter theorists in the Marxist, post-modernist and feminist traditions who critique the dominant philosophies of the era. This is a writing intensive seminar and students should be prepared to write a significant number of papers of varying length and will be expected to extensively revise their work.

        This course is an expansive investigation into how revolution has been conceptualized across nearly 100 years of research in the social sciences. The course will compare theories on when, why, and under what conditions various types of revolution occur in the context of studying a wide variety of revolutionary movements. We also ask why some revolutions fail while others don't. We look at structural reasons, economic pressures, cultural frameworks, the impact of external interests in a country's stability, and role of ideology in revolution. We end with a discussion of the nature of revolution in light of current 'revolts' 'rebellions' 'social movements' and 'uprisings' that span the mid-2Oth century to the present. This course will bring together a number of theoretical strands in the discipline including political economy, state-society relations, the international setting, state-building, state-failure, and the role of culture in politics as frameworks for understanding the nature of revolution.

What opportunities and challenges exist in mobilizing the members of minority groups for political action in the U.S.? What role have racial issues and attitudes played in the electoral strategies of political parties and candidates and in the electoral choices of voters? How do the structures and processes of American political institutions affect the efforts of minority groups to secure political influence? How has the rise to power of minority politicians-particularly in many urban areas-affected policymaking? How successful have minority groups been in their quest to use government to expand economic and educational opportunity? How are demographic forces likely to reshape the politics of race and -American politics more generally- in the 21st century?

        The theory and practice of international organizations (IOs) is a dynamic and increasingly important dimension of world politics. Scholars debate whether IOs serve as venues in which learning processes can occur and expectations about norms of international interaction can be created and reinforced, or whether they are merely another venue in which states pursue their national interests. This course will provide an introduction to the field, focusing on the role of IOs in three principal areas: peace and security, human rights, and humanitarian and development assistance. It will serve as a particularly relevant class for students who may want to participate in the UN or Brussels semesters, as it will provide a grounding in various theories of IOs and their value in the international system.

        Americans have paid closer attention to terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks. However, terrorism is neither new nor a distinctive threat to the United States. In fact, terrorist attacks have been commonplace since 1945. This course presents an overview of terrorism's evolution in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This course is divided into four parts. Part one provides a historical overview of terrorism and distinguishes it from other forms of political violence. Part two compares and contrasts ethno-nationalists and religious terrorist organizations, showing that both groups, while informed by different mindsets, use terrorist tactics in an attempt to achieve clear political ends. Part three examines the evolving strategic logic of suicide terrorism. Part four shows how the forces of globalization are changing the scope and strategies terrorist groups employ.

        This course traces the history of Christianity from the death of Jesus to the break up of the Roman empire (seventh century) and the rise of Islam. Important theological questions (such as: who is Jesus [Christology]; what does he do [soteriology]; the nature of God; why is there evil in the world [theodicy]) are considered and placed in the context of ancient Roman history and philosophy. These considerations help us to understand the meaning of Christian martyrdom, the effect of Constantine's conversion, the origins of Christian worship and sacred space (Constantine's St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, in particular), ecclesiastical and clerical orders (bishops and priests, for example), monasticism, the doctrine of "original sin," and apocalyptic expectations. The appeal of alternate Christianities such as Gnosticism and Arianism and the decline of Classical religion are also considered. Offered fall semester in even-numbered years.

"Popular" religious practices, such as cults of the saints, miracles, and the unique artistic genius of the medieval cathedral are placed in a broader context. Fruitful Christian coexistence as well as violent conflict with Islam and Judaism are also considered, as are the multiplicity of "heretical" Christianities (including Catharism and Waldensians).

        This course considers one of the most influential authors in the Western world. We will take the entire spiritual journey from hell to heaven and of Dante's Divine Comedy and consider it in Dante's medieval intellectual, literary and political context. In addition to the Comedy, we read selections from Dante's On Monarchy and The New Life. Other primary texts include selections from Aquinas, Bonaventure, Guido Cavalcanti, Boccaccio's Life of Dante, and Dino Compagni's Chronicle of Florence, along with other contemporary chronicles as we examine medieval Florence and the intellectual background of the Comedy. This course is a seminar emphasizing class discussion and written research assignments of different lengths. This counts as an Italian "Language in Context" course. The course employs a student-generated "geographic database" as a research tool. This database of primary texts and images allows the students to rapidly immerse themselves in Dante's contemporary Florence and better understand how Dante used the particular details of his surroundings to build poetic image and metaphor.

We will then examine how these ideas became transformed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in movements and events as varied as romanticism, the Red Cross, colonialism, World War I, Pan-Arabism, and Wahhabism.

        This course will provide an overview of the ways in which a sociological perspective informs our understanding of mental health and illness and will cover the historical, social, and cultural contexts encompassing the experience of mental illness. This course emphasizes social, rather than the biological or medical, factors in order to gain a better understanding of the meaning and precursors of mental illness, paying particular attention to the ways in which these processes differ across social groups. We will discuss how mental illness is defined and how those definitions are applied to different people. In addition, we will examine how persons with mental illness are cared for and how "care" has changed over time.

Because the 1960s saw big changes on the theatrical scene in Britain it is taken as a starting point, and we see what we can of the playwrights who helped form our present day theatre through the twentieth century. Because it does not operate in a vacuum, appropriate plays may be chosen from other periods and cultures that address crucial global, social and political issues.

        A full-time apprenticeship or internship lasting from early May through late August with the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey. The specifics of each assignment are determined by the department, the Shakespeare Theatre, and the individual student. The apprentice program is designed for students with little experience and a primary interest in acting. Apprentices receive intensive training in scene study, voice and movement, and have broad exposure to all aspects of theatre production, gaining valuable knowledge and experience in each. The internship program is designed for more advanced students interested in developing their knowledge and skills in a specific, non-acting area, such as set, lighting, or costume design, directing, stage management, general management, publicity, and box office. Requirements include the keeping of a journal that records the student's day-to-day activities and experiences, a detailed written summary of the entire apprenticeship/internship, and a creative project. All work must be completed before the student finishes the program. Exact completion date and nature of the creative project are determined in consultation with the Shakespeare Theatre and the Drew faculty adviser.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        An interdisciplinary course designed to lay the groundwork for the women's and gender studies major and minor. Also appropriate as a first course for any student interested in pursuing the study of gender within their major field. This U.S. focused course considers questions fundamental to the field: What is a woman? What is gender? What is sex? How does culture construct gender and gender difference? How do gender, race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality intersect and interact?; the course, also, lays the groundwork for further work in the field by introducing students to analytical and critical concepts and approaches for understanding the lives of women and the construction of gender within larger social, political, and cultural structures; and it considers how we think about individual lives using these questions.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        In this class we will examine how scholars have understood and made sense of how gender issues intersect with economic globalization. Two ways in which economic globalization is manifest is through changes in trade in goods and services, and migration. We will focus on these two aspects of economic globalization. As we will discover through the readings and our discussions, scholars from a range of disciplines/theoretical frameworks, (eg economics, history, cultural studies, anthropology, sociology, political science, feminist, post-colonial theory), have contributed to our understanding of economic globalization and the way in which gender and globalization intersect.

        This course introduces students to the comparative study of works of literature from various cultures, read in English translation. We consider diversity of place, social context, politics, history, genre, tradition, and literary movements. We look at literature in relation to its original cultural context and also at the way books communicate to other cultures and to us. The works, cultures, and thematic emphasis will vary from year to year. The initial theme for 2008 and 2009 is "The Literary Journey in World Literature." This course will be team-taught with one or two primary instructors from different departments, with visits from instructors in other literary fields. Students may with permission read works in the original language.

       <dd>
        This seminar introduces students to a variety of theoretical approaches to literary translation, as well as experience in translating literary texts. The course will begin with a history of approaches to translation, by reading both theoretical essays and a set of common texts in multiple translations, including works of classical and Biblical literature as well as contemporary prose and poetry. Each student will then undertake a translation of a short work of fiction or poetry with the goal of producing a publishable text in English. Students may work from any language into English or from a dialect or historical variety of English into a contemporary idiom. The seminar will feature guest lectures by Drew faculty from various programs whose work includes literary translation speaking about their own projects and experience as translators.
