  <p>On a cold night in late January, more than 100 people took to Franklin Field to celebrate the public launch of the Young Quakers Community Athletics (YQCA) initiative, an after-school mentoring program. YQCA is a partnership between Pennâ€™s Barbara and Edward Netter Center for Community Partnerships and the Division of Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics (Penn Rec), and pairs intercollegiate and varsity players with athletes from three West Philadelphia K-8 schools: Comegys, Huey, and Lea.</p>
