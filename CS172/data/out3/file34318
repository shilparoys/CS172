      <p><a href="images/grad_poster_2014.pdf" target="_blank">MFA Poster</a> <br> <br> The core of the program is independent creative work done in consultation with faculty. MFA students can work in any medium. UCR has facilities for photography, painting, video, digital media and sculpture. Individual graduate studios are provided.</p> 
      <p>The MFA is a Plan I (thesis) master's degree program, requiring 72 units in graduate or approved upper-division undergraduate courses that must be completed with at least a letter grade of "B" or "Satisfactory."</p> 
      <p>Required courses include 48 units in graduate courses in theory and criticism, as well as individual projects and tutorials:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Three courses of Art 285, Graduate Critique</li> 
       <li>Art 230, Contemporary Critical Issues</li> 
       <li>Art 240, Critical Theory</li> 
       <li>Art 299, Research for Thesis</li> 
       <li>Art History Graduate Seminar</li> 
       <li>Five courses of Art 290, Individual Tutorial</li>

      <p>MFA students will receive a degree in Visual Art. The course of study is not characterized by medium. </p> 
      <p>The thesis requirement is met by the student's MFA thesis exhibition, accompanied by a written thesis on the work exhibited. A graduate thesis committee reviews the thesis. The committee is composed of three faculty members, at least two from the Department of Art. The third faculty member may be from another department. </p> 
      <p><strong>Teaching requirement:</strong> None; however, students are given opportunities to teach and are encouraged to do so. </p> 
      <p><strong>Foreign language requirement:</strong> None </p>

      <p>The Graduate Division allows limited funding to the Art Department pertaining to international students, and the department is not able to make attractive financial aid packages. Please note that the MFA program in Visual Arts is a three (3) year program and students that go beyond the normative time will have to pay for tuition and fees on their own behalf. If an international student is accepted into the program they along with the other domestic students within the program are required to maintain a minimum 3.5 GPA. If your GPA falls below this minimum the student runs the risk of losing their funding and having to pay for tuition and fees.&nbsp; Please note that tuition and fees per quarter are substantially higher for international students and does not cover the cost of living. Also, remember that you must fill out the Financial Verification form to provide evidence that you have adequate monies in order to be admitted.</p>
