               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;"><strong>II. Additional Guidelines for Microbiology Laboratory Safety Procedures</strong></p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">The following laboratory safety guidelines for Microbiology courses are in addition to the laboratory safety procedures to be followed for all biology laboratories:</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">1. No eating, drinking, smoking or application of cosmetics is allowed in the laboratory.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">2. No food or beverage containers may be brought into the lab. No food may be stored in laboratory refrigerators.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">3. A lab coat or designated protective clothing must be worn at all times. A long-sleeved scrub top that buttons or snaps closed is acceptable. The garment must cover the arms. You must be able to remove it without pulling it over the head, and it must be washable in hot water.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">4. Some laboratory exercises require the use of gloves or protective eyewear. These are provided. Your instructor will point out when these specific items are required.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">5. Shoes must be worn at all times in the laboratory. Sandals or other open-toed shoes are not permitted.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">6. Tie back long hair to avoid contact with open flames.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">7. Do not place fingers or objects, such as pencils, labels, tape, etc., in your mouth when working in the lab.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">8. Do not pipette by mouth. All pipetting must be done using a pipette pump and the used pipettes are to be placed in the correct disposal container.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">9. Lab benches should be clear except for the items needed to perform the experiment. Place bookbags, coats, etc., in designated areas.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">10. Wash your hands thoroughly before you begin the lab, after you are finished with the lab and before you leave the room for any other reason. Antimicrobial soaps are provided in the lab. Do not use any other soaps.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">11. Wash your hands immediately and thoroughly if they become contaminated with microorganisms.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">12. Clean your work area on the lab bench with disinfectant before you begin your work, after you are finished, and immediately after any spill.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">13. Report all cuts, spills, broken glass or other accidents at once to your instructor.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">14. In the case of spills: Report at once to your instructor. Cover spilled material with a paper towel and soak with disinfectant. Leave for 20 minutes. Then discard the material in the biohazard buckets.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">15. For broken glass: Report at once to your instructor. Do not touch broken glass with your bare hands. Put on gloves and use a broom and dustpan to clean up the glass. Dispose of ALL broken glass in the specific container marked for glass. DO NOT place broken glass in the regular trash.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">16. Disposal of contaminated waste: Buckets with biohazard bags are provided for the disposal of contaminated waste. Discard any material that has been contaminated with bacteria or viruses (e.g. Petri dishes, pipettes, swabs, and test tubes) in the designated buckets. A separate container is provided for the disposal of used glass slides. DO NOT POUR ANY TUBES CONTAINING BACTERIA DOWN THE SINK.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">17. Non-Disposable contaminated materials: Some materials are autoclaved and reused. Examples are plastic caps, forceps, and glass screw-cap tubes. Designated containers of disinfectant are provided for these items. Your instructor will tell you which container is appropriate.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">18. Handling Cultures: It is not necessary to wear gloves when handling bacterial cultures unless you have cracks or open cuts on your hands. However, gloves are provided and you may use them at any time. Do not open Petri dishes to smell cultures. Do not leave Petri dishes open for long periods on the counter. No cultures or culture material may be taken from the lab.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">19. Be careful using Bunsen burners. Turn off burners when not in use. Keep hair and clothing away from open flames. Do not reach over open flames to get objects. Keep containers of alcohol away from open flames.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">20. Inoculating loops will be hot after they are flamed. Hold them with the insulated handle. Place all loops back in the loop holder in an upright position (not down on the counter).</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">21. When you are done using the burner, close the gas jets completely. If you smell gas in the lab, check for a leak in the burner tubing or an open stopcock. If you cannot locate the leak, notify your instructor.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">22. Locate the fire extinguisher, the fire blanket and all exits from the room. Follow your instructor's guidelines for using each.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">23. Observe warning labels on chemical reagents. These provide information on the safe use of these chemicals. Many chemicals are flammable. Keep them away from open flames.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">24. Locate the eyewash station. It is to be used if bacteria or chemicals splash in your eyes.</p> 
               <p class="style1" style="font-weight: normal; text-align: start;">25. Blood, blood products and some body fluids have been implicated in the transmission of many serious viral diseases (HIV, hepatitis, etc). If a lab experiment involves blood or body fluid, wear goggles and gloves. Only work with your own blood or fluid. Large volumes of blood, body fluids or other clinical material must be handled using gloves, face shields or countertop shields, or a biosafety hood. Your instructor will inform you if these precautions are necessary. All contaminated material must be placed in a biohazard bag for proper disposal.</p>
