     <h1>Campus Pastor's Staff</h1>
     <p>The purpose of the chapel ministry at Westmont College is to nurture the pure love of God in the church as it is gathered in a Christian liberal arts community.</p> 
     <p>&nbsp;</p>

His most recent work is entitled, <em>Muscular Faith</em>.</p>

From 1975 to 1989 he was with the Irvine Presbyterian Church of California, of which he was the founding pastor. Ben was also minister of youth and adult education at the La Jolla Presbyterian Church of California.
