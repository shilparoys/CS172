That basket gave #15 Westmont Women's Basketball (24-5, 11-5 GSAC) a 68-67 Golden State Athletic Conference win over rival Biola (16-14, 8-8) in the final GSAC game of the regular season. "I'm proud of my team for pulling out a win," said Westmont head coach Kirsten Moore. "Biola played great and gave a great effort. It took everything we had to come out with a victory. It was really fun to play in front of a great crowd tonight on senior night and to pull out a win for our seniors." Before the game, Westmont honored Celina Gougis and Esther Lee were honored for their years of service on the Warrior team. "I am very proud of both Esther and Celina for what they have given to this program," said Moore. "Both were starters on our (2013) national championship team. They are competitive and play with joy for the game. They like to have fun, but they are super competitive people and have worked very hard. I am thankful for all that they have given to the program and am glad we could get them a win tonight."

In front of a packed house of friends, family and alumni the Westmont men's basketball team pulled out a last minute 64-60 overtime win against Biola University. After the nice words were said, awards were handed out and seniors were recognized, the men took the court with determination in their eyes. They hit the ground running, but seemingly could not hit a shot. The men went 8-23 from the field in the first half --only making one three point shot. While the Warriors got off to a slow start, with only a score of 21-19 at the half, they pushed hard in the final twenty minutes only to send the game into an overtime win. "It is an emotional night," opened head coach John Moore. "You have your challenges with a night like this because of everything that is going on. Biola did a very nice job of playing the type of defense that they needed to. Our guys weathered the storm and did a good job of taking the lead at halftime." Coming into the second half, the men seemed to rally and put some points on the board. They started to work the ball down to senior Daniel Carlin who was up against some of the biggest defenders the Warriors have seen yet this season. That being said, the Aussie notched another double-double of the season with a team high of 20 points and 11 rebounds.

A lead-off double by Michael Stefanic and back-to-back home runs by Blake Matthias and Michael Pollex paved the way for Westmont Baseball's 7-0 Golden State Athletic Conference blanking of the Mustangs of The Master's College (17-5, 12-4 GSAC). With the win, the Warriors improved to 16-5 overall and 10-4 in GSAC play. Harmening struck out 10 batters in the seven innings he pitched while surrendering just one walk and scattering four hits. The junior from Oceanside improved to 5-1 on the year and lowered his earned run average to 1.29. Stephen Larson pitched the final two innings for the Warriors, striking out two, allowing one walk and giving up two hits. Offensively, the Warriors pounded the Mustangs for 15 hits, including seven for extra bases. After scoring three in the first, Westmont added two more in the third. Matthias, Pollex and Derke started off the inning with three triples in a row, resulting in one run scored and runners on first and second. Steven Pollex then doubled to left center, driving in his brother, Michael.

It helped that all five hits went for extra bases - three doubles and two triples. Corban took a 2-0 lead in the fourth inning on a two-RBI single to left center by Vince Gonzalez. The Warriors responded with two runs of their own in the bottom half of the inning. With one away, Alex Bush doubled to left center and then reached third on a wild pitch. After Will Barring was walked, Graylin Derke struck out for the second out of the inning. Derek Rodrigo then tripled down the right field line to drive in both Bush and Barring. Westmont's other three runs came in the bottom of the sixth. Bush led off the inning and was hit by a pitch. Barring then hit a bloop-double into right field to give the Warriors two men in scoring position with no outs.

The Westmont women's tennis team (6-3, 4-1 GSAC) unearthed an old rivalry this afternoon as they headed down south to take on Azusa Pacific University (6-2). The Warriors have only matched up against the Cougars a handful of times since Azusa transferred out of the NAIA two years ago. But it looks like Division II has treated them well, since the Cougars took down Westmont 7-2 this afternoon on the Bavougian Tennis Courts. Lauren Stratman and Ines Costamagna held it down on the number one doubles court as they notched the first victory of the day with a 9-8 (4) win over the Cougars' Johnson and Ingwaldson. The win was not only another notch in the dynamic duo's undefeated record this season, but brought Azusa's point streak of 39 consecutive singles and doubles matches won to an abrupt end. "Lauren and Ines had to fight to pull out their doubles win," opened head coach Kendyll McManigal, "They dug deep and raised the intensity as the match wore on."

Tonight, the #20 Westmont men's basketball team (19-9,11-4 GSAC) dropped a tough game against #4 Hope International University (25-2, 13-2 GSAC) in Murchison Gymnasium. It was one of those games where the cards were stacked against them, yet everyone was hoping for the best upset of the season. Unfortunately, when push came to shove, the Royals played the better hand and came out with the 75-62 victory. "It really came down to the experience that Hope has," explained head coach John Moore. "We have not had many games this season where we looked inexperienced or seemed like a team that was a little out of sorts. But tonight, they got to us." The Warriors came out with fire in their eyes as they took the court tonight. In the first half alone, there were nine times when the score was tied and seven lead changes. Westmont was putting up a much deserved fight, but once Hope got on a roll, there was no looking back. Hope's defensive pressure seemingly sent the Warriors into overdrive, so they were unable to slow down and gain control of their play. Westmont went 19-57 from the field tonight (4-23 from the three point line). While they were making some hustle plays, the natural rhythm and flow of their game was off. "Jeff Azain made a good point after the game when he said 'It looked like our men had the weight of the world on your shoulders tonight.' This game is supposed to be fun, but tonight it was tough," reflected Moore.

The Warriors posted an 83-52 Golden State Athletic Conference win over the Royals on Tuesday and in the process, secured a home game at Murchison Gymnasium for the first round of next week's GSAC Playoffs. Aysia Shellmire also posted a double-double for the Warriors notching 13 points and 10 rebounds. Esther Lee added 12 points and Cora Chan put up 11 points, three rebounds and three assists. In the first five and one-half minutes, Westmont jumped out to an 18-6 lead with Lee recording 10 points and McCoy six during the initial Warrior drive. The Warriors led by as much as 22 points in the first half (40-18) and held a 45-26 advantage at halftime. The second half saw more of the same with Westmont talking its biggest lead of the night (32 points) on a jumper by Krissy Karr that made the score 72-40 with just under eight minutes to play. In other GSAC action tonight, #18 The Master's (20-8, 10-5) defeated Biola (16-13, 8-7) by as score of 73-62 while William Jessup (3-23, 2-13) posted a 65-61 win over the visiting Firestorm of Arizona Christian (6-23, 2-14).

Westmont's men's basketball team (19-8, 11-3 GSAC) finished their longest road trip of the season with a 78-64 win against San Diego Christian (5-18, 0-15 GSAC) this evening. Earlier this week, the Warriors took down #11 Arizona Christian, so tonight's win will cap off the second win of a very successful travel series. Over the last four days, the Warriors have traveled roughly 809 miles (thanks Google Maps) on a bus, to play two very important conference games. They began with an upset against Arizona on Thursday night and finished with a solid, confidence boosting game against San Diego Christian this evening. With only two games left in regular season conference play, every point, every repetition and every win matters. Thankfully, the men's team has proven their ability to play well on the road and walked away with an undefeated record this weekend. After a bit of a rough start this evening against the Hawks, the Warriors managed to work their way into the fifth tie score of the game and head into halftime with 37-37 on the scoreboard. From the moment the Warriors stepped onto the court in the second half, they played like a different team. The men were able to regain their footing and dominate for the final 20 minutes on the clock. As the time wound down, the Warriors only got better. The men posted an impressive 66.7 field goal percentage in the final twenty, sinking 16 of their 24 total shots. Their locked in defense pulled down a grand total of 36 rebounds and held the Hawks to a 40 percent shooting average for the game. "That was a good win for the Warriors tonight," remarked head coach John Moore. "Shooting 66 percent from the field in the second half certainly doesn’t hurt, and playing good defense with that kind of offense on the road makes for a good combination."

School and stadium records were re-written and several Westmont athletes posted qualification marks for the upcoming NAIA Indoor National Championship. John Nealon was the only Westmont man to record an automatic qualification mark. He posted a time of 1:54.72 in the 800 meter run while finishing a second place to UCSB's Jordan Scott (1:54.15). Bradford Ortlund came in first in the 100 meter dash in a time of 11.61. Josh Taylor claimed first in the 200 meter dash with a mark of 23.48. The Gauchos claimed a 120 to 65 win over Westmont's men and a 127 to 10 win over Pepperdine. The Westmont men defeated Pepperdine 130 to 12. The women's competition was capped at the end of the day with a blistering 4 x 400 meter race. Both UC Santa Barbara and Westmont's "A" teams beat the previous stadium record. However, Westmont's Elysia Mitchell pulled ahead down the final stretch for the win.

Lee scored 14 points while making four of seven shots from beyond the arc, giving her a total of 1002 points in a Warrior uniform. Since transferring to Westmont after her freshman year at Colorado-Boulder, Lee has averaged 11.5 points per game. The Warriors were led in scoring by freshman forward Lauren McCoy who recorded a double-double of 23 points and 10 rebounds. McCoy went 11 for 13 from the field. Junior forward Aysia Shellmire also scored in double figures, contributing 11 points and five rebounds. Westmont led by just two points (35-33) with 18 minutes remaining in the second half before going on a 15-0 run. Back-to-back three's by Lee ignited the run. After Karr followed with another three, Lee hit her fourth three of the night to reach the 1,000 point mark.
