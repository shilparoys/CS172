       <strong>Woman’s day</strong>
       <br> Each year one of our majors is awarded a prize in memory of Shilpa Raval, a 1991 Drew graduate
       <br> who studied English, classics and women’s studies. Raval (1969-2004), a popular professor
       <br> of Latin at Yale, specialized in gender and sexuality in the ancient world.

      <h2>Careers Made easy</h2> 
      <h3>women’s work</h3> 
      <p>Our majors have gotten <strong>great résumé experience</strong> through projects such as helping refine the curriculum of Prepare, a New York—based organization that offers self-defense training. Our students, of course, take the training themselves in order to experience and understand it.</p> 
      <p>Being profoundly interdisciplinary means our majors can go on to a <strong>wide variety of careers</strong> based on their interests—from graduate school in history or social sciences, to the arts to nonprofit activist and social service organizations.</p> 
      <p>Students have <strong>benefited from combining our major with language studies</strong>. We’ve run a number of language-based Drew International Seminar programs and summer programs in places such as the Dominican Republic, Argentina, Morocco and France that deal with issues of gender, race and identity.</p>

             <p>Other courses may be applied to the major if they are proposed to and approved by the Women’s and Gender Studies Committee.</p>

               <p>An interdisciplinary course designed to lay the groundwork for the women's and gender studies major and minor. Also appropriate as a first course for any student interested in pursuing the study of gender within their major field. This U.S. focused course considers questions fundamental to the field: What is a woman? What is gender? What is sex? How does culture construct gender and gender difference? How do gender, race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality intersect and interact?; the course, also, lays the groundwork for further work in the field by introducing students to analytical and critical concepts and approaches for understanding the lives of women and the construction of gender within larger social, political, and cultural structures; and it considers how we think about individual lives using these questions.</p>
