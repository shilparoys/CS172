        <h1><strong>Welcome to the Social Media Directory</strong></h1> 
        <h2>Be a Part of the Online Conversation</h2> 
        <p>The University of Texas at Austin is all about people making meaningful connections in the world. And through the amazing power of social technologies on the Web, the research, teaching and service taking place at the university are made even more accessible.</p> 
        <p>We invite you to browse the university’s social media directory and engage with our faculty, students, staff and alumni. Use the “Sort By” navigation in this section of the Know Web site to browse by “media type,” where you’ll find Longhorns on Twitter, YouTube, blogs, Flickr and more. You can also browse the social media directory by the university’s colleges, schools, administrative offices, and libraries and museums.</p> 
        <h2>We Want to Hear from You</h2> 
        <p>We need your help to make the university’s social media directory as comprehensive as possible. If you’re a member of The University of Texas at Austin community and don’t see your social media effort listed here, let us know and we’ll add your social media site to the ever-growing list of the university’s participation on the social Web. Visit the “<a href="know/suggest/">Send Us Your Content</a>” page here on the Know Web site, and submit your social media site.</p> 
        <p>Did we list your social media site incorrectly? Please use the “<a href="know/suggest/">Send Us Your Content</a>” page to let us know.</p> 
        <h2><a href="http://www.utexas.edu/know/directory/guidelines/">Social Media Guidelines</a></h2> 
        <p>We believe it is important for all University of Texas at Austin units, faculty, staff and students to be aware of social media and how social technologies can help you create and nurture relationships, share information, advance knowledge, raise awareness, build support, participate in important conversations and collaborate on new ideas.</p> 
        <p>Visit the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/know/directory/guidelines/">Social Media Guidelines</a> here on the Know Web site for more information on how to appropriately and effectively engage with social media.</p> 
        <p>Whether you’re a faculty member using social media as a part of the classroom experience or a staff member who’s been charged with the exciting task of growing a social media presence for an administrative unit, you’ll find these guidelines helpful in navigating the quickly evolving world of social technologies.</p> 
        <h2>More Guiding Principles for Engaging with Social Media</h2> 
        <p>University Communications at The University of Texas at Austin wants to help all university staff, faculty, students, as well as our Web visitors, engage in social media, blogs, social networks and the online community. University Communications offers these additional best practices for engaging in social media.</p> 
        <p><strong>Respect and Ethics</strong></p> 
        <p>At The University of Texas at Austin we encourage different viewpoints and opinions, and as a participant in social media, you should, too. Be respectful of others’ viewpoints. If you disagree and would like to engage in a conversation, do so cordially, logically and ethically. As always, the university’s code of ethics applies, even in the realm of social media and online networks. Keep in mind that there is no such thing as a “private” social media Web site. What you write from your home computer may follow you to school or work.</p> 
        <p><strong>Accuracy and Honesty</strong></p> 
        <p>Write about your areas of expertise, research or study at The University of Texas at Austin. If you are writing about a topic related to the university, or research conducted at the university, but you are not the in-house expert on the topic, make this clear to your readers and check the facts before you post. If there is a Web site you used to gather facts, provide the link for your readers to show accountability. Also, always write in the first person. Your unique voice contributes to the overall message of the university. If you make a mistake, admit it. Your followers will be more willing to forgive and forget if you are up front and quick with your correction. Maintain a high level of quality that exhibits superior grammar, punctuation and spelling.</p> 
        <p><strong>Value and Interest</strong></p> 
        <p>When posting to your blog, Twitter or Facebook, ask yourself if your content adds value and interest to the discussion. Make sure your comment, post or tweet is a valued piece of information. If your insight helps people improve knowledge or skills, discover something interesting, solve problems, or better understand The University of Texas at Austin, more than likely you are adding value. There are millions of people, companies and universities on the Web. If you want to stand above the clutter, make sure you provide content that is exciting, engaging and stimulating.</p> 
        <p><strong>Personality</strong></p> 
        <p>In the social media realm, you are encouraged to use your own voice and bring your personality to the forefront. The Web is a venue that is relaxed, open and diverse–embrace it. A voice that is over-institutionalized and rehearsed can repel your audience. Make sure your site is not a place for self-promotion. Some social media sites, such as Twitter, close down such sites.</p> 
        <p><strong>Transparency and Disclosure</strong></p> 
        <p>When communicating using social media or blogs–Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn, Blogger, WordPress, or others–on behalf of The University of Texas at Austin, or in your role as a university staff or faculty member, make sure you clearly identify yourself and your affiliation with the university. Being open about your ties to the university will illustrate credibility and transparency. Make sure you have a formal disclosure that identifies your comments as your unique viewpoints. For instance: “The posts on this site are my own and don’t necessarily represent The University of Texas at Austin’s academic goals or opinions.” When writing for personal blogs or social networking sites, make sure you disclose your affiliation with the university if you discuss university-related topics. This will enhance credibility with your readers.</p> 
        <p>Have we missed a guiding principle for engaging with social media that should be listed here? Or do you have an experience about engaging with UT social media sites that you’d like to share?</p>
