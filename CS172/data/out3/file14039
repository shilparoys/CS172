    <ol> 
     <li>To access Panopto, login to <a href="https://egator.greenriver.edu">Canvas</a> and choose your class.&nbsp; Once in the class, you'll see a button labeled Panopto Recordings on the left navigation bar.&nbsp; If you don't see it, go to course settings&gt;navigation tab&gt;drag Panopto Recordings up into the nav menu and save it.&nbsp; Clicking on the link will open Panopto which can only be accessed through Canvas.&nbsp; We are not able to login to Panopto directly. </li> 
    </ol> <p class="auto-style3"><strong>What do I need to <a name="Use_">use </a>Panopto? </strong> </p>
    <ol> 
     <li>To capture lectures you need to have the Panopto Recorder installed. IT should have it installed on all faculty office computers and all teacher workstations.&nbsp; If the recorder is not installed on the campus computer you are using and you're not a local administrator on the computer, call the IT Helpdesk at&nbsp;x2222 and they will install it for you.
      <ol> 
       <li>Before calling them, login to Canvas and click on Panopto Recordings.</li> 
      </ol> </li> 
     <li>To install it yourself in you are an administrator on your computer, go to <a href="https://egator.greenriver.edu">Canvas</a>, open a class, click on Panopto Recordings in the left nav bar.&nbsp; When Panopto loads, you'll see a link in the upper right directly below your username that says&nbsp;

      </div> &nbsp; Download Recorder. </li> 
     <li>The Panopto viewer plays inside a browser so no additional software is needed.</li> 
     <li>If you are recording in the classroom, it's advisable to use a wireless microphone.&nbsp; We recommend getting the best wireless setup your budget can afford.&nbsp; Sound quality is highly correlated to the quality of your recording equipment.&nbsp; Here is the one we recommend.&nbsp; <a href="http://en-us.sennheiser.com/wireless-lavalier-microphone-clip-on-set-presentation-ew-112-g3"> http://en-us.sennheiser.com/wireless-lavalier-microphone-clip-on-set-presentation-ew-112-g3</a> The IT Helpdesk at x2222 will help you with the purchase and installation if needed. </li> 
     <li>If you are using Panopto in your office or at home, we recommend that you use a headset to record.&nbsp; Here too, we recommend you get the best headset your budget can afford.&nbsp; Here is one suggestion <a href="http://en-us.sennheiser.com/professionelles-gamer-headset-super-noise-cancellation-pc-350"> http://en-us.sennheiser.com/professionelles-gamer-headset-super-noise-cancellation-pc-350</a>&nbsp; The IT Helpdesk at x2222 will help you with this purchase too.</li> 
    </ol> <p class="auto-style3"><strong>What happens if I choose the <a name="Share_">Share</a> link for my recordings?</strong></p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>First some background: When you add a recording to a class folder all of your students are automatically given access. </li> 
     <li>&nbsp;If you hover over any recording Share is one of the menu options that lights up.</li> 
     <li>When you click on share, this is one of the choices “Anyone who can sign in to this site” 
      <ol> 
       <li>Site does not mean your class site. It actually means anyone with a Panopto account. </li> 
      </ol> </li> 
     <li>So selecting this option puts a link to your recording in the All Sessions folder of every Panopto (Canvas) user including student.</li> 
     <li>If you have selected that option for any of your recordings, please go back to share for that recording and delete the option by clicking on the X at the end of the Anyone who can…line.</li> 
    </ol> <p><strong><span class="auto-style3">Will Panopto automatically <a name="transfer_">transfer</a> my videos to my classes for the next quarter?</span></strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><span class="style7">Your recordings will not automatically transfer when you copy a previous Canvas class into a new shell.&nbsp; On the all sessions page, you'll see a folder for each class you've accessed through Canvas.&nbsp; If you don't see the class you want, go back to Canvas, open that class and click on Panopto Recordings.&nbsp; That will automatically create a folder for the class.&nbsp; Once you have a folder, find the class folder that has the recordings you want to transfer and <a href="panoptovideos/moveavideo.wmv">move them</a>.</span></p> <strong> <p><strong><span class="auto-style3">Helpful h<a name="Hints_">ints</a> on recording</span></strong></p> </strong></strong>
   <ol>
    <strong><strong> <li> <span class="auto-style2"><strong>DO NOT shut down the computer until Panopto has completed the upload of your recording</strong></span>.&nbsp; You can logout but if you shut the computer down before Panopto has finished uploading, it will stop the process.&nbsp; Panopto saves a copy of your recording on the computer you're using so the next time you login, it will continue with the upload.&nbsp;
       <ol> 
        <li class="style5">The recording uploads in the background so you can start a different one while another is uploading.</li> 
        <li class="style5">If you’re using a TWS computer and need to leave at the end of the class, log out and make sure the next person knows not to shut down the computer.</li> 
       </ol> </li> <li class="style5">Most mics won't capture comments from the class so remember to repeat questions before you answer them.</li> <li class="style5">Be aware of what you’re saying since any part of or all of your recording can be downloaded and put on a public site such as YouTube.&nbsp; </li> <li class="style5">Remember the mute button</li> </strong></strong>
   </ol> <strong> <p class="auto-style3"><strong>Can I <a name="edit_">edit</a> a Panopto recording?</strong></p> </strong> <p class="auto-style6">Yes you can edit your recording but it is limited.&nbsp; </p> <strong> <p class="auto-style3"><strong>Can I <a name="upload_">upload</a> other video, audio, text files or a URL to my Panopto course site?</strong></p> </strong> <p class="auto-style6">You can drag and drop files from your computer. hese are the supported file types for videos:</p>

    <li>Use Panopto if you have a webcam and want to record a video of yourself or a speaker.</li> 
    <li>Use Panopto any time you would otherwise use Camtasia, Captivate, SnagIt or any other screen capture software.&nbsp; It's free and the others with the exception of SnagIt are not.&nbsp; SnagIt limits the size of your video.&nbsp; Panopto does not</li> 
    <li>Panopto is free to all faculty/staff and we have unlimited storage available.</li>

   </ol> <strong> <p class="auto-style4">Camtasia, Captivate, SnagIt, and other free recorders: the only reason to use these and other software like them is if you want capability that only these programs have.</p> </strong>

    <li>The two main differences between the programs you pay for and Panopto are editing and special effects. Programs you pay for have more sophistocated editing and special effects capatility.</li> 
    <li>The main difference between free programs and Panopto is the size limits.&nbsp; All free programs limit the size of the recording and most to five minutes.&nbsp; But Panopto is also free and there is no size limit.</li>
