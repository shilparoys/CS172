          <em>"A Scholar Leading With an Open Mind and a Compassionate Heart"</em>
          <br>
          <br> Alyssa Alleyne--Atherly is a third-year student in the College of Computing and Information Sciences majoring in Information Technology. A 2011 Summer Bridge graduate, Alyssa quickly established herself as a leader and scholar at RIT. In her first year, Alyssa was selected as an MCAS Scholar and a Program Assistant (PA) for the 2012 MCAS Summer Bridge Program. She also received the Unsung Hero Award, the highest student honor, at the 2012 MCAS Star Awards.
          <br>
          <br> Her natural talent as a servant leader is evident in her involvement on campus. Currently, Alyssa serves as Vice-President of the National Pan-Hellenic Council and Historian of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. She previously served as Historian for Unity House and Publicity Director of Society of African American Business Students (SAABS). She is also an active member of Unity House, National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and Women in Technology. When balancing the pressures of leadership, Alyssa says, "I don’t find fault, I find a remedy."
          <br>
          <br> Modeling the "MCAS Way", Alyssa is well-respected among her peers as a role model, mentor and friend. Alyssa currently serves as an MCAS mentor, where she has the opportunity to provide guidance and support to first-year AALANA students. She is also a founding member of the Rochester, NY chapter of Determined Individuals Victoriously Achieving Success (D.I.V.A.S). D.I.V.A.S is an empowerment group that promotes sisterhood, excellence, and positivity among college women of color. When asked about how she maintains healthy relationships on campus, Alyssa answers, " I am as true to my friends as I am to myself." Additionally, Alyssa often dedicates her time to help other students academically. She not only provides guidance and tutoring to IT majors, she also served as a Peer Advisor for the Academic Support Center.
          <br>
          <br> Eager to take on new challenges and experiences, Alyssa traveled to Croatia to study at the American College of Management and Technology during the Summer of 2013. While in Croatia, she studied small business sustainability, sociology, and environmental science. During this time, Alyssa also had the opportunity to travel around Croatia from Dubrovnik to Zagreb. After returning from Croatia, Alyssa started a co-op at Lenel Systems International as a Quality Assurance Engineer.
          <br>
          <br> 
          <p>When asked about the motivation behind her academic, leadership, and professional achievement, Alyssa simply states, "I try to be the yardstick of quality. Everyone isn’t used to an environment where excellence is an expectation." </p>
