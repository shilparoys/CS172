If you are <b>NOT</b> the person whose identity is being used, you will not be able to answer the questions correctly. </p> <p> Information which you provide on your claim is verified against state and federal records to insure that it is correct. NJLWD uses LexisNexis to assist with the verification of your identity. The State of New Jersey and LexisNexis do not retain, store or share your personal information that is provided for identity verification. </p> <p> NJLWD staff is not informed of what questions are asked or how you responded to the questions. Instead, an identity Pass/Fail designation is assigned to each UI claim based on the responses to the questions. </p> <p> <b>NOTE:</b> If you choose not to participate in the identity verification questions, you STILL will be permitted to continue with the filing of your UI claim or certify for benefit payments. HOWEVER, <b>NO</b> unemployment insurance benefit payments will be paid until NJLWD confirms that your identity has been properly verified. </p> <p> If you elect not to answer the questions presented, you will be required to report <u>in-person</u> to one of NJLWD's designated office locations and to bring acceptable documentation to verify your identity. Information will be mailed to you, at the address that you indicate on your UI application, with a listing of what is acceptable identity verification documentation and the NJLWD designated office locations available for in-person verification. </p> </h3>
