        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>It matters for many reasons! By seeing underneath the ground we learn more about how the North American continent was put together, and how it has changed through time. One practical example of this is learning more about geologic hazards, like earthquakes and volcanoes.</p> 
         <p>Not all dangerous faults reach the earth’s surface, and EarthScope helps us to peer into the earth and better understand these faults and the threats that they might pose to cities and people. EarthScope also helps us understand why there are volcanoes in certain places, and lets scientists explore and understand the "plumbing" of volcanoes, including Yellowstone.</p> 
         <p>In addition, we can study lots of smaller geologic mysteries – there could be an EarthScope project in your backyard! Check out our "Field Programs".</p>

        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>The EarthScope Facility has three main components: the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), and USArray. PBO comprises a network of about 1200 stations covering the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, including continuously operating GPS, borehole and laser strainmeters, seismometers, and tiltmeters. SAFOD provides physical samples and seismic, geodetic and electromagnetic data from the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, California. USArray comprises a nationwide long-term seismic Reference Network supported by multiple agencies; the 400-station Transportable Array that is slowly marching from west to east and will reach the East Coast in 2012; and a backbone network of seven magnetotelluric observatories. PBO and USArray also include portable equipment pools for use in temporary experiments proposed by individual scientists; maintain integrated data management systems; and support education and outreach activities including teacher training and curriculum development, sponsorship of summer intern and research experiences for undergraduates, and technical workshops and software development.</p>

         <h3>What is the physical size of the EarthScope Facility?</h3> 
        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>This is a difficult question to answer because the Facility is so distributed, but perhaps the single best answer is the area of the US States and Territories covered by the EarthScope Facility network. The EarthScope Facility has, or will have, stations in all 48 contiguous States, Alaska, and Puerto Rico; this is a total of 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers). Of course, individual stations are much smaller than that, and the sum of the area covered by each individual station would be much smaller.</p>

          <li>More than 1200 different groups downloaded data from the Facility in just the last quarter of 2010.</li> 
          <li>During the construction of the Plate Boundary Observatory, EarthScope crews drilled boreholes totaling over 19 km in depth.</li> 
          <li>The SAFOD borehole is over 3.2 km long and ends about 2.7 km below the surface (the borehole is vertical for the first 1.5 km, then is tilted for the remaining length).</li>

        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>A strainmeter is an instrument used to measure changes, or deformation, of the Earth. One type of strainmeter is called a linear strainmeter, which measures changes in the distance between 2 points, usually by using a laser. The long-base laser strainmeter (LSM) is an example of an extensometer, which measures the change in length along a line. Borehole strainmeters measure strain change by very accurately sensing change in the shape of an instrument cemented into rock. Because the dimensions of the instrument are only a few inches, very precise measurements are required. A typical signal is 10 nanostrain = 0.000 000 001mm across the instrument.</p>

         <p>The word "magnetotellurics" has two parts - "magneto" or magnet and "telluric" or earth current. Magnetotellurics use natural or man-made electric and/or magnetic fields to image the inside of the Earth. The magnetic or electric waves change as they pass through materials made of different things (like rocks of different types or temperatures, or rocks that have a lot of fluid) and scientists use these changes to learn about layers and structures deep inside the Earth.</p>

        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p class="caption">A seismograph is a device for measuring the movement of the earth, and consists of a ground motion detection sensor, called a seismometer, coupled with a recording system. A simple seismometer that is sensitive to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight hanging on a spring. The spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earthʼs surface. As the earth moves, the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides a measure of the vertical ground motion. If a recording system is installed, such as a rotating drum attached to the frame, and a pen attached to the mass, this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion, called a seismogram. Seismographs are usually used to record earthquake waves, but they can also record ground motions caused by a wide variety of natural and man-made sources, such as trees blowing in the wind, cars and trucks on the highway, and ocean waves crashing on the beach." - from IRIS, <a href="http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/publications/brochures_onepagers/doc/OnePager7.pdf" rel="external" target="_blank">http://www.iris.edu/hq/files/publications/brochures_onepagers/doc/OnePager7.pdf</a></p>

         <h3>How does GPS work?</h3> 
        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>Global Positioning System satellites send signals to equipment on the ground (receivers). Each of the 29 satellites transmits information with a specific location and time, and they all transmit that information at the same instant. Because some of the satellites will be farther away from the GPS receiver on the ground than others, it will take a longer or shorter amount of time for each signal to reach the receiver. The distance to each satellite can be determined by the amount of time it takes for the receiver to get the transmitted information. Once the receiver has gotten signals from at least 4 GPS satellites it can calculate its position in 3 dimensional space.</p>

         <h3>How do GPS instruments help us understand how the ground moves?</h3> 
        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>The GPS instruments used by EarthScope are permanent stations - once they are placed in the ground they are not moved. However, because of the motion of the tectonic plates the ground on which the stations are located is moving. By repeatedly measuring the changing distance between each GPS station, geologists can determine the movement along faults or between plates.</p>

         <p>LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. It is a remote sensing technique very similar to radar, but LiDAR uses a laser instead of radio waves. It is used to detect distant objects and precisely determine their position, speed, rotation, make-up, etc. LiDAR is often used by geologists to build detailed, 3-dimensional maps of the surface of the Earth, but it can also be used for many other purposes like looking at the structure of clouds or the composition of the atmosphere.

         <p>Finding locations for our Transportable Array Seismic Stations is no easy task! We have great student workers who go out in the field and locate good sites for us. Sites must fall within a certain area so that we can keep the stations close together. The spots must be far away from big roads and train tracks because the instruments are so sensitive they can "hear" that noise. It must also be away from lots of people who might damage the equipment, and away from tall trees that would block the solar panels. Once the students think they might have found a good location they speak with the people who own the land and ask if EarthScope can install a instrument. Then our dedicated team of technicians installs the instrument and equipment needed to keep it running.</p>

         <p>We would love to! However, seismic instruments are costly to maintain so we reuse the same instruments over and over.</p>

        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>By putting the seismic stations closer together, we are able to get a better "picture" of the interior of the Earth. You can think of it like the pixels in a photograph - the more pixels you have, the higher the resolution of your photo, and the more details you can see. EarthScope's seismic instruments are just like pixels - the more we have and the closer they are the better the picture they produce.</p>

         <h3>Why did you drill into the San Andreas Fault?</h3> 
        </div> 
        <div class="toggle-container"> 
         <p>We feel the shaking from earthquakes on the surface of the Earth, but earthquakes actually begin deep inside the Earth. Scientists wanted to look at the rocks and measure the conditions where earthquakes actually occur - inside a fault - so they drilled down into an area of the San Andreas Fault where there were a lot of small earthquakes. Rock and fluid samples were continuously collected during the drilling process, and are used to analyze changes in geochemistry and mechanical properties around the fault zone. Many instruments were placed into the drill hole, including instruments that measure temperature, fluid, pressure, earthquake waves and many other important features. The project will lead to a better understanding of the processes that control the behavior of the San Andreas fault.</p>
