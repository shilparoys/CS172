     <link>http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/02/new-guidance-to-help-protect-student-privacy-in-educational-sites-and-apps/ 
     <description>
      When signing up for a new technology, digital service, or app, there’s a simple little check box near the end that most of us don’t give much thought. But for schools and districts, agreeing to a terms of service agreement could have big implications for student privacy.

     <title>Breaking the Cycle of Homelessness for America’s Students and Families</title> 
     <link>http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/02/breaking-the-cycle-of-homelessness-for-americas-students-and-families/ 
     <description>
      In a recent video, the New York City Rescue Mission proved just how invisible America’s homeless are. Have the Homeless Become Invisible? illustrates the challenge. In this social experiment several people came face to face with their relatives and loved ones dressed as homeless persons on the streets of Soho. Not one individual recognized his or her loved ones.

     <title>The Importance of Transforming Adult Learning</title> 
     <link>http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/02/the-importance-of-transforming-adult-learning/ 
     <description>
      Several years ago, Carmen — a single, widowed parent — immigrated from Mexico to California to create a better life for herself and her two-year-old son. When she arrived in the U.S., she spoke very little English. She enrolled in ESL classes at New Haven Adult School and then went on to earn her GED. But Carmen soon realized that she needed to acquire more skills in order to find a job that paid a living wage. While working part-time, maintaining a home and raising her children, Carmen went on to earn her Adult Education Teaching Credential.

     <title>It’s Time for Equitable Spending of State and Local Dollars</title> 
     <link>http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/02/its-time-for-equitable-spending-of-state-and-local-dollars/ 
     <description>
      We believe that every child should receive a strong education that prepares him or her for success in college, careers, and life. It shouldn’t matter what a child looks like, how much his or her parent makes, or what zip code they live in; all students should be given the same opportunity and resources to achieve. However, because our country has long used local property taxes to fund schools, school funding is not spent at equal levels.

     <title>Creating a New Federal Education Law: Have you asked me?</title> 
     <link>http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/02/creating-a-new-federal-education-law-have-you-asked-me/ 
     <description>
      As a Classroom Teaching Ambassador Fellow, I have the unique opportunity to view education through two perspectives—first, as a teacher in metro Atlanta and, second, as an employee of the U.S. Department of Education. Having the privilege to serve in this dual capacity comes with a great responsibility to question what I see every day in education and to share my truth.

     <description>
      If you’re planning on going to college this fall, you will definitely want to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®). The FAFSA not only gives you access to grants and loans from the federal government, but many states and schools also use information from the FAFSA to award their financial aid.

     <title>It’s Past Time to Move Beyond No Child Left Behind: Addressing America’s Teachers and Principals</title> 
     <link>http://www.ed.gov/blog/2015/02/its-past-time-to-move-beyond-no-child-left-behind-addressing-americas-teachers-and-principals/ 
     <description>
      For more than a decade, states and schools throughout this country have worked within the narrow confines of the No Child Left Behind law. It’s long past time to move past that law, and replace it with one that expands opportunity, increases flexibility and gives schools and educators more of the resources they need.
