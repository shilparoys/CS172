      <br>
      <br>Activity Update: All volcanoes in the Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington are at normal background levels of seismicity. These include Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams in Washington State; and Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three Sisters, Newberry, and Crater Lake in Oregon. Complimentary data from geodetic, hydrologic, and geochemical monitoring systems installed at subsets of Cascade Range volcanoes also did not reveal any anomalous activity.
      <br> 
      <br> Recent Observations: Seismicity at Cascade Range volcanoes in Washington and Oregon was at background levels during the week. Field crews took advantage of good weather earlier in the week to repair stations in the crater and on the flanks of Mount St. Helens and to survey sections along the North Fork of the Toutle River.

      <br>This report on the status of Kilauea volcanic activity, in addition to maps, photos, and Webcam images (available at http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/activity/kilaueastatus.php), was prepared by the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO). All times are Hawai`i Standard Time. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>KILAUEA VOLCANO</b> (VNUM #332010) 
      <br>19°25'16" N 155°17'13" W, Summit Elevation 4091 ft (1247 m)
      <br>Current Volcano Alert Level: WARNING
      <br>Current Aviation Color Code: ORANGE
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Activity Summary: </b> Kīlauea Volcano continues to erupt at its summit and from its East Rift Zone. The inactive distal tip of the June 27th lava flow remains roughly 500 m (~550 yd) from Highway 130 in the area west of the Pāhoa Fire and Police Stations. Breakouts continue in both the down slope and up slope flow areas. The breakout along the north margin of the stalled flow tip is still active but sluggish, and has not advanced since Monday. The leading edge of this flow is approximately 1.6 km (1 mile) up slope of Highway 130. Activity has diminished along the new breakout that started from the upper June 27th tube on the north flank of Puʻu ʻŌʻō.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>June 27th Lava Flow Observations: </b> While the flow continues to widen, no advancement has been observed since Monday. The lobe on the south side of the flow, about 870 m (0.5 mi) up slope of Malama Market, is no longer advancing, but hosts a few active breakouts several hundred meters upslope of the stalled front. Activity remains on new breakout that started from the upper June 27th tube on the north flank of Puʻu ʻŌʻō, but activity has diminished steadily since the breakout began. The breakout about 3 km (2 miles) northeast of Puʻu ʻŌʻō at the forest boundary remains active. Scattered activity also continues west of Kaohe Homesteads in the same general areas that have been active for about the last month, as well as in a slightly down slope area. Observers on a Civil Defense overflight this morning reported no change in any of the down slope flow areas.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>Puʻu ʻŌʻō Observations: </b> The tiltmeter on the north flank of Puʻu ʻŌʻō shows either no significant tilt over the past couple of days. HVO's overflight on Friday revealed minor lava ponds in a couple of the pits at Puʻu ʻŌʻō, but there have been no lava flows from these pits in the past couple of days. The rate of sulfur dioxide emission from all East Rift Zone vents was about 200 tonnes per day, measured on January 7 (unfavorable wind and weather conditions have prevented more recent measurements). 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>Summit Observations: </b> Tiltmeters operating around the summit began recording deflationary tilt beginning early in the day on Sunday, March 1. Emission rates of sulfur dioxide were measured at 3,300 tonnes/day on February 13. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br> 
      <b>Sulfur Dioxide Emission Rate estimation caveat:</b> Starting in 2014, we report the emission rate estimated by a new, more accurate method. The numbers increase by a factor of 2-4 but the actual emission rate has not changed. For more on this reporting change, please read http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/view.php?id=207
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>Background:</b>
      <br> 
      <u>Summit</u> The summit lava lake is within an elliptical crater (unofficially called the Overlook crater), which has dimensions of approximately 160 m (520 ft) by 210 m (690 ft), inset within the eastern portion of Halemaʻumaʻu Crater. The lake level has varied from about 25 m to more than 200 m (out of sight) below the floor of Halemaʻumaʻu Crater. The Overlook crater has been more-or-less continuously active since it opened during a small explosive event on March 19, 2008. The lake level responds to summit tilt changes with the lake generally receding during deflation and rising during inflation. Since 2013, the lava level has been typically between 30 m (100 ft) and 60 m (200 ft) below the floor of Halemaʻumaʻu Crater. Small collapses in the Overlook crater are common, and over time have resulted in a gradual enlargement of the Overlook crater. The ambient SO2 concentrations near the vent vary greatly, but are persistently higher than 10 ppm and frequently exceed 50 ppm (upper limit of detector) during moderate trade winds. The gas plume typically includes a small amount of ash-sized tephra (mostly fresh spatter bits and Pele's hair from the circulating lava lake). The heaviest pieces are deposited onto nearby surfaces while the finer bits can be carried several kilometers before dropping out of the plume. 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>East Rift Zone vents and flow field</u> The eruption in Kīlauea's middle East Rift Zone started with a fissure eruption on January 3, 1983, and continued with few interruptions at Puʻu ʻŌʻō Cone, or temporarily from vents within a few kilometers to the east or west. A fissure eruption on the upper east flank of Puʻu ʻŌʻō Cone on Sept. 21, 2011, drained the lava lakes and fed a lava flow (Peace Day flow) that advanced southeast through the abandoned Royal Gardens subdivision to the ocean within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park in early December 2011. The flows stalled and re-entered the ocean starting on November 24, 2012, until activity started to decline and the ocean entry ceased in August 20, 2013; the flow was dead by early November, 2013. The Kahaualeʻa flow, which started from the spatter cone/lava lake at the northeast edge of the Puʻu ʻŌʻō crater floor in mid-January 2013 was dead by late April, but a new flow (informally called Kahaualeʻa 2) became active in the same area in early May 2013, waxing with inflation and waning with deflation. The Kahaualeʻa 2 flow died following the onset of a new breakout from the northeast flank of Puʻu ʻŌʻō on June 27, 2014. The June 27th flow advanced to the northeast, confined to old grounds cracks for part of its length, and has been slowly approaching the town of Pāhoa.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>Hazard Summary:</b>
      <br> 
      <u>East Rift Zone vents and flow field</u> Lava flows from the June 27 breakout have advanced into Pāhoa and may threaten residential areas depending on their level of activity and advance rate. Near-vent areas could erupt or collapse without warning with spatter and/or ash being wafted within the gas plume. In addition, potentially-lethal concentrations of sulfur dioxide gas may be present within 1 km downwind of vent areas. Active lava flows within forested areas can produce methane blasts capable of propelling rocks and other debris into the air. All recently active lava flows are within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park and adjacent State land managed by the Department of Land and Natural Resources or the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>Kīlauea Crater</u> Ash and Pele's hair can be carried several kilometers downwind, and potentially-lethal concentrations of sulfur dioxide can be present within 1 km downwind.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>Viewing Summary:</b>
      <br> 
      <u>East Rift Zone flow field</u> The June 27th lava flow is currently within the Kahaualeʻa Natural Area Reserve, which has been closed by the Hawaii State Department of Natural Land and Resources (DLNR) due to the ongoing volcanic hazards (http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/ecosystems/nars/reserves/hawaii-island/kahaualea/), and the Wao Kele o Puna Forest Reserve, also closed by DLNR and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/blog/2014/09/12/nr14-113/). According to the Hawaii County Civil Defense website (http://www.hawaiicounty.gov/active-alerts/): "The public is reminded that the flow is not visible and cannot be accessed from any public areas." 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>Puʻu ʻŌʻō Cone and Kīlauea Crater</u> These areas are within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park; Park access and viewing information can be found at http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/lava2.htm.

      <br> 
      <u>composite seismic events:</u> is a seismic signal with multiple distinct phases that has been recorded frequently at HVO from the Halema`uma`u Overlook vent area since its explosive opening in March, 2008. For the composite events recorded at Halema`uma`u, we typically see an initial high frequency vibration lasting for a few seconds that have been correlated with rockfalls. This is followed by about 30 seconds of a long-period (LP) oscillation with an approximately 2- to 3-second period. The final phase of the signal is several minutes of a very-long-period (VLP) oscillation with an approximately 25- to 30-second period. The LP signals are interpreted to be from the uppermost portion of the conduit and VLP signals are interpreted to be fluid passing through a deep constriction in the conduit through which lava rises to the pond surface we see in the webcam.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>DI tilt event:</u> DI is an abbreviation for 'deflation-inflation' and describes a geophysical event of uncertain volcanic significance. DI events are recorded by tiltmeters at Kilauea summit as an abrupt deflation of up to a few microradians in magnitude lasting several hours (weak DI events) to 2-3 days (strong DI events) followed by an abrupt inflation of approximately equal magnitude. The tilt events are usually accompanied by an increase in summit tremor during the deflation phase. A careful analysis of these events suggests that they may be related to changes in magma supply to a storage reservoir at less than 1 km depth, just east of Halema`uma`u crater. Usually, though not always, these changes propagate through the magma conduit from the summit to the east rift eruption site, as many of the DI events at Kilauea summit are also recorded at a tiltmeter at Pu`u `O`o delayed by several hours. DI events often correlate with lava pulses and/or pauses in the eruption at the Pu`u `O`o/Peace Day vents.

The vent is actually a pit, or crater, in the floor of the larger Halema`uma`u Crater which is, in turn, in the floor of the larger Kilauea caldera or crater - a crater within a crater within a crater. It is easiest to describe as a pit inset within the floor of a crater within a caldera. The pit is about 160 m (525 ft) in diameter at the Halema`uma`u Crater floor, is about 50 m in diameter at a depth of 200 m (660 ft) below the Halema`uma`u Crater floor. From November, 2009, to now, a lava pond surface has been visible in this pit.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>incandescence:</u> the production of visible light from a hot surface. The term also refers to the light emitted from a hot surface. The color of the light is related to surface temperature. Some surfaces can display dull red incandescence at temperatures as low as 430 degrees Centigrade (806 degrees Fahrenheit). By contrast, molten lava displays bright orange to orange-yellow light from surfaces that are hotter than 900 degrees C (1,650 degrees F).
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>LPs:</u> - Long Period (LP) events refer to earthquakes that have a lower frequency or tone than typical earthquakes and are usually attributed to the resonance of fluid- and gas-filled conduits, cracks and/or chambers. Because of their association with fluids and gases, LP earthquakes in the vicinity of volcanoes can be useful for monitoring purposes. At other volcanoes LP earthquakes are also known as low-frequency earthquakes, tornillos or B-type earthquakes.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>mauka, makai:</u> Hawaiian terms for directions relative to the coast - makai or ma kai (toward the coast) and mauka or ma uka (toward the highlands or away from the coast).
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>microradian:</u> a measure of angle equivalent to 0.000057 degrees.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>pali:</u> Hawaiian term for cliff or precipice.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>tephra:</u> all material deposited by fallout from an eruption-related plume, regardless of size.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <u>tonne (t):</u> metric unit equal to 1,000 kilograms, 2,204.6 lbs, or 0.984 English tons.

      <b>OTHER NORTHERN MARIANA ISLAND VOLCANOES</b>
      <br> Equipment failure on 29 December 2014 resulted in the loss of seismic data from Sarigan and Anatahan. Recent field visits to these volcanoes has restored the flow of seismic data, and USGS is now able to continue with routine seismic monitoring of Anatahan and Sarigan. Analysis of satellite images showed no signs of activity at these or any of the other volcanoes in the Northern Mariana Islands.

      <b>YELLOWSTONE VOLCANO</b> (VNUM #325010) 
      <br>44°25'48" N 110°40'12" W, Summit Elevation 9203 ft (2805 m)
      <br>Current Volcano Alert Level: NORMAL
      <br>Current Aviation Color Code: GREEN
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Seismicity</b>
      <br> 
      <br> During January 2015, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, responsible for the operation and analysis of the Yellowstone Seismic Network, reports 178 earthquakes were located in the Yellowstone National Park region. The largest event was a small earthquake of magnitude 1.9 on January 20, at 9:03 PM MST, located 6 miles north of West Yellowstone, Montana. 
      <br> 
      <br> January seismicity was dominated by an earthquake swarm occurring on January 20 to 21st, about 6 miles north of West Yellowstone, Montana, accounting for 135 earthquakes (ranging in magnitude from -0.7 to 1.9). The swarm included the largest earthquake in January (detailed above).
      <br> 
      <br> Yellowstone earthquake activity is at background levels.
      <br> 
      <br> 
      <b>Ground deformation</b>
      <br> 
      <br> After a fascinating year of ups and downs, deformation in north-central Yellowstone has returned to near background levels. 
      <br> 
      <br> Caldera GPS stations continue to record the pattern of slow uplift that has persisted since the beginning of 2014. An example can be found at:
