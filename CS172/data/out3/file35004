    <h1><span> Loans </span></h1> 
    <p>Loans are a valuable resource for students and their parents because they allow you to postpone paying a portion of your educational costs until after you graduate or after you drop below half-time (6 credits) enrollment. Repayment of student loans is traditionally scheduled over a ten-year period beginning 6 months after you leave school. As of July 1, 2009, parents who borrow from the <a href="#fedplus">Federal Direct PLUS Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)</a> program may choose to defer payments until six months after the date the student ceases to be enrolled at least half time. Accruing interest could either be paid by the parent borrower monthly or quarterly, or be capitalized quarterly.</p>

    <blockquote> 
     <p><b><a href="http://www.ed.gov/DirectLoan/about.html">Federal Direct Loan</a></b>William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans are provided by the federal government and require that you first file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The <a href="http://www.ed.gov/DirectLoan/about.html">Direct Loan Program</a> provides a simple way to obtain and repay student loans; the U.S. Department of Education is the lender and the loan funds are sent directly to RIT. If you borrowed federal loans at a previous institution, you can combine those loans with the Federal Direct Loans under the <a href="http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/consolidation/">Direct Consolidation Loan Program</a>. Your academic year level and dependency status determines the maximum annual amount you may be eligible to borrow; the federal government also monitors loan aggregates for both undergraduate and graduate students.</p> 
     <p>What Kinds of Direct Loans are Available?<br> </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Direct Subsidized Loans&#x2014;are loans for students with financial need, as determined by federal regulations. &nbsp;No interest is charged while you are in school at least half-time and during deferment periods. </li> 
      <li>Direct Unsubsidized Loans&#x2014;are loans for students that are not based on financial need. The interest on your loan will accumulate while you are in school. You may choose to either pay the interest, or to defer the interest payment, in which case it will be capitalized.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><strong>Federal Direct Student Loan 2014-2015 Interest Rates</strong></p> 
     <p>The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 ties federal student loan interest rates to financial markets. Under this Act, interest rates will be determined each June for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan will have a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. A 1.072% origination fee is deducted by the government from each loan disbursement. <em>Effective October 1st the loan origination fee will increase from 1.072% to 1.073%</em>.</p>

     <p>If you are a first-time borrower on or after July 1, 2013, there is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that you can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. This time limit does not apply to Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans. If this limit applies to you, you may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150 percent of the published length of your program. This is called your &#x201c;maximum eligibility period.&#x201d; For additional information refer to Policies and Information: <a href="/emcs/financialaid/time_limits.html">Time Limits on Direct Subsidized Loan Eligibility for First Time Borrowers</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="privateloans"></a>Alternative (non-federal) Loans</h2> 
    <h3> <a name="altloans"></a>Alternative Educational Loans</h3> 
    <blockquote> 
     <p>Alternative educational loans are private loans (non-federal) offered through banks to supplement financial aid awards. RIT is required to certify these loans to ensure that the loan amount does not exceed the cost of attendance less all other financial aid. Most alternative loans are disbursed equally into student accounts according to enrollment plans. We suggest that students and families use alternative loans as a last option after first pursuing all federal loan options. If you decide that an alternative loan is right for you, you may borrow from any lender that you choose. When choosing a lender for an alternative loan, you may wish to consider the following factors:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Loan costs (interest rates and fees)</li> 
      <li>Borrower benefits and discounts</li> 
      <li>Customer service</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>We encourage students to review information on at least the factors listed above when choosing a lender for an alternative loan. You may also want to consider applying for a private student loan through a credit union. A credit union might be able to offer you a loan with an affordable interest rate, zero origination fees, and flexible repayment options. For additional information regarding responsible student loan borrowing and evaluating student loan lenders, visit <a href="responsible_borrowing.html">the responsible student loan borrowing page</a>.</p> 
     <p>When applying for your loan remember to request the amount of funds for the full academic year. Once your application has been approved with a credit check, we will certify your eligibility and schedule the disbursement of funds directly into your RIT account. Credit checks on alternative loans are only valid for a period of time that is determined by the lender. In many cases, the lenders use 180 days. An application completed too soon before the start of your first term may not be valid.</p> 
     <p>For more information and advice on how to research your alternative loan options, please refer to the following information offered by <a href="http://www.finaid.org/loans/loancomparisonsites.phtml">FinAid.org</a>.</p> 
     <p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Rochester Institute of Technology does not maintain a preferred lender list. Thus, the Institute has no agreements or relationships with any lenders and does not receive any benefit, financial or otherwise, from the use of alternative loans by students. For more information about the Institute&#x2019;s policies, please refer to our <a href="http://www.rit.edu/emcs/financialaid/code_of_conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
