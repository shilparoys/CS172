     <p>Presidential historian, Pulitzer Prize-winner and contributing editor at TIME, <strong>Jon Meacham</strong> is one of America’s most prominent public intellectuals. He is known as a skilled raconteur knowledgeable about politics, religion, and current affairs. He understands and analyzes how issues and events impact our lives.</p> 
     <p>Meacham’s latest presidential biography, Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller. Fortune magazine hailed it as “masterful and intimate,” Amazon.com named it one of the best books of the year, and Walter Isaacson called it “A true triumph. A fascinating look at how Jefferson wielded his driving desire for power and control.”</p> 
     <p>His New York Times bestselling American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House won the Pulitzer Prize for biography. Meacham used the seventh president’s unpublished correspondence and other sources to create “an unflinching portrait of a not always admirable democrat but a pivotal president, written with an agile prose that brings the Jackson saga to life.”</p> 
     <p>Born in Chattanooga in 1969, Meacham was educated at McCallie and at the University of the South, where he was salutatorian and Phi Beta Kappa. He began his career as a reporter at The Chattanooga Times. He and his wife live with their three children in Nashville and in Sewanee.</p>
