        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p> 
        <p>Comcast is committed to the creation and delivery of Interactive Broadband products and services that enable people to simplify and enhance their lives.&nbsp; The Comcast Local Media Development (“LMD”) department manages services designed to strengthen delivery and discovery of local content, including Public, Educational and Governmental (PEG) programming.&nbsp; A list of such websites can we found at www.mspro.comcastlmd.com&nbsp;(the&nbsp;<strong>“Web Services“</strong>).</p> 
        <p>LMD Web Services are designed to supplement new and existing content efforts from providers, producers and other sources of local content and events like agencies, community organizations and City officials.</p> 
        <p>Web Services provides communities with a wonderful opportunity for local organizations, including public, education, and governmental access media to gain web, mobile and marketing resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To provide those services, below we describe what is expected of our Content Partners in a relationship with Comcast through participation in Web Services.</p> 
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>BELIEFS AND RIGHTS</strong></span></p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>We believe that it is important for all of us to treat each other with consideration and respect.</li> 
         <li>The behaviors that we demonstrate reflect the attitude of respect and dignity for all.</li> 
         <li>Our goal is to provide a safe and professional interactive media environment for all community members</li> 
         <li>With the restrictions described below understood, no Comcast staff or agent will exercise editorial control over&nbsp;video content</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p><strong>Therefore, the following standards for Content Partners have been developed.&nbsp; Violation of any one of these standards can result in loss of privileges on Web Services.&nbsp; As such, Comcast and its agents have full authority and discretion to deny access privileges as and when it deems appropriate.</strong></p> 
        <p>The Web Services are a medium for expression and free speech.&nbsp; No individual will be denied the use of the Web Services on the basis of race, sex, age, physical disability, religion, or political belief.&nbsp; It is hoped that Content Partners will utilize this resource as a means to distribute a wide variety of programs.</p> 
        <p>Comcast or an agent of Comcast will provide access to training materials in the use of the Web Services along with technical assistance for ongoing use. Neither the Comcast staff nor agents of Comcast are available to serve as a production crew to make programs or cover events for Content Partners.</p> 
        <p><strong>Comcast reserves the right to review all definitions and policies contained in this, and related, documents and has the discretion to interpret, implement and make changes as deemed necessary</strong>.</p> 
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>GROUP INFORMATION &amp; PROCESS</strong></span></p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>An entity may become a Content Partner through an application available on the Web Services</li>
