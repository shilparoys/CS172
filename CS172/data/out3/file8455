Any indemnification under subsection a. of this Section 1 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in a specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former Director, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because the Director, officer, employee, or agent has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsection a. of this Section 1.&nbsp; Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a Director or officer at the time of such determination, by:<br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a majority vote of the Directors who are not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, even though less than a quorum;<br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by a committee of such Directors designated by majority vote of such Directors, even though less than a quorum;<br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if there are no such Directors, or if such Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or<br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the Members.<br> <br> d.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation may pay for or reimburse reasonable expenses incurred by a Director or officer in defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding in advance of the final disposition in the manner specified in subsection c. of this Section 1, (including attorneys' fees), if such Director or officer furnishes the Corporation with a written undertaking by or on behalf of such Director or officer to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that such Director or officer is not entitled to indemnification as authorized under this Section 1.&nbsp; Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former Directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as determined by a majority vote of Directors who are not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding, even though less than a quorum.<br> <br> e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any indemnification and advancement of expenses provided under this Section 1 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.<br> <br> f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this Section 1.<br> <br> g.&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of this Section 1, references to "other enterprises shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation shall include any service as a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such Director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation as referred to in this Section 1.<br> <br> h.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Section 1 shall be legally valid and enforceable only to the extent now or&nbsp; hereafter allowed by the statutes and judicial decisions of the State of Delaware.<br> <br> <span style="color:#4b0082;">Section 2.&nbsp; Other Rights Preserved.&nbsp;</span> The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those persons involved may be entitled under any agreement, vote of Members or disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.<br> <br> <span style="color:#4b0082;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>Article XII</strong></span></span><br> <br> <span style="color:#a52a2a;"><strong>Seal of the Corporation</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color:#4b0082;">Section 1.
