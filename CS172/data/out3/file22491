     <description xml:space="preserve">
       11:00 AM to 3:00 PM - Pioneer Center: Project Prom Dress is a program that collects donated formal dresses and gives them away. In today’s precarious economic state, people are finding that they are simply not able to drop $100 or more on a dress that will only be worn once. Girls from Allegany and the surrounding counties do not have to worry about that this year! Come and select from hundreds of new or lightly used prom dresses and take one home without any cost!
