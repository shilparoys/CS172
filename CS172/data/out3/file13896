       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Statisticians tell us that millions of children around the globe are suffering physical and psychological traumas. Psychologists tell us that what constitutes "healing" for a child who has undergone trauma is still a mystery. How are religious communities to respond to these children in crisis? How do we create awareness? How do we minister to children and their families? For the church, the Bible has been the book most often turned to for guidance in times of trouble. But does the Bible really address the needs of children? In this course we attempt to explore various dimensions of childhood trauma and how the Bible can be both a weapon and a tool when it comes to the care of children.

        Proverbial wisdom as a part of the larger corpus of wisdom Literature, with its concern with issues of ethical and savoire-faire, practical know-how, plays an important role in the creation, critique, and maintenance of social, religious, and political structures in Africa and in the Bible. The course will explore how theoretical issues about the nature, content, and function of proverbial wisdom in African literature can impact and contribute to the interpretation of biblical proverbs. Accordingly, the course will combine rhetorical criticism and reader-response analyses in exploring these issues. A central focus will be on Proverb Performance: the purposeful transmission of a proverbial saying in a particular context in order to provoke and evaluate responses in both oral and literary contexts.

       <dd>
        A study of the historical emergence of the novel in the pluralistic cultural context of ancient Mediterranean peoples, double colonized by the culture of hellenism and the empire of Rome. Considering the effects of linguistic stylization and hybridization, irony and appropriation, the course tracks the novel's tendency to disrupt stable boundaries between places, times, and literary genres and explores how perceptions of difference--measured across ethnicity, class, gender, cultic affiliation--are sharpened even as identity is made more complex, malleable, and permeable.

        If Acts is empirical historiography does creating a sub-category of religious history bring the reader any closer to understanding the identity formation and socio-political issues attendant on the role of angels, auditions, and visions. Angels, auditions, and visions are non-empirical events. This class explores the engagement of a mythic worldview with those characters and events in the Acts of the Apostles. Can a mythic worldview shed further light on non-empirical and empirical passages in Acts and on the relationship between communities of story teller in an ancient empire? In this class we will read selected passages in the Acts of the Apostles in order to begin answering these questions."

        Charitable fundraising in support of the outdoor ministry programs of the various denominations is facing increasing challenges to the previous "routine" processes by which the extra-congregational services are funded and maintained. As congregational/parish allotments are reduced to provide funding for more and more local interests/needs, the amounts left to support broader service ministries are diminished. These ministries, then, are forced to develop their own support bases and "asking techniques" in order to provide both basic services and new initiatives. This course will offer a presentation of the basic tenets and concepts for charitable fundraising, an investigation of the requisite elements for a successful program and the specific techniques used in the design of a fundraising program for specific initiatives, the "asking" process, and the specific "ask." Since the course will provide several opportunities for the application of concepts to a specific case situation, students should come prepared with the descriptive details (financial, population, and program descriptions) of an independent ministry program to be used in these exercises.

        High Medieval Europe witnessed two simultaneous revolutions: the birth of a commercial, proto-capitalist economy, and a popular religious awakening that drew on Biblical texts to mount a wide-ranging social critique of the emerging profit economy as well as established religious institutions. In this course students will read both modern historical accounts and also medieval documents about heretics, saints, lepers, and moneylenders in order to trace the origins of an urban commercial culture and to examine its critical observers, the voices of both the "orthodox" and "heretical" evangelical poverty movements of the eleventh through the fourteenth centuries. In considering both heretical and orthodox figures and beliefs as well as the changing conditions of profit-making and poverty, we shall explore medieval Europeans' notions of a rightly ordered society and the legacy left to us by their ideas about wealth and charity.Texts include biographies of such figures as Saints Francis,

        This course offers students an introduction to the scholarly debates framing a Celtic past, and then studies the lived historical context of the early medieval period, the sacred literature (both prose and poetry), and the distinctive spiritual themes and the modern interpretation of the lived practice of Christianity among the Celtic-speaking peoples of medieval Europe (located in South-West Britain, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Breton France). We shall consider the identifying category of the term Celtic, and we shall examine medieval texts, images, and the archaeology of the religious culture that emerged from the region, as well as modern scholarship and contemporary spiritual commentary on Celtic Christianity, in order to explore the origins and the relevance of this tradition for modern religious life.

One aim of this course is to consider and problematize the rubrics that modern historical studies typically bring to the study of women in the pre-modern past, including such notions as womens independence, power, agency, individuality, and subjectivity.

Some of the questions that motivate our inquiry are: Who counts as a mystic, and why? And who gets to decide? What is the relationship between mystical contemplation and social action? Between mysticism and religious orthodoxies? How do we understand mystics in relation to their particular contexts? What spiritual and intellectual insights for our own time can we glean from reading mystics from another moment in time?

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        How is Christian religious life affected by perceiving Jesus as the mother of the faithful, and how did this portrayal of Jesus come into being? Medieval writers, both male and female, conceived of the maternality of Jesus as embodying feminine nurture in his spiritual and sacramental relationship with humankind. As historian Carolyn Bynum observes, "What writers in the high middle ages wished to say about Christ the savior who feeds the individual soul with his own blood was precisely and concisely said in the image of the nursing mother whose milk is her blood, offered to the child." This course will examine spiritual, theological, and devotional texts and images from the high and later middle ages that cast Jesus as a divine mother in order to explore the sources, the logic and the power of this understanding of God. Students may choose to write either a formal historical research paper or to develop tools based in medieval sources to support contemporary worship in order to

We will give particular attention to (constructions of) Gnosticism and Arianism and their orthodox counterparts, while also attending to other controversies such as the Origenist, Priscillianist, Pelagian, and Nestorian.

        What are the historical origins of Christian practices and theories of prayer? How are these origins entwined with the histories of prayer in other ancient Mediterranean religious traditions? In our own time, how do Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists (among others) pray, and how do they understand their practices? What are the implications of particular kinds of prayer for theology, or of particular kinds of theology for prayer? To what extent and in what ways is prayer an embodied practice? How does prayer draw on material objects, and what is the role of sensory perception in prayer? Such questions will be considered in an exploratory seminar designed primarily for MDiv and MTS students, but open to others. Practice as well as theory will be incorporated into the class sessions: students may be asked not only to observe but also to try new things.

        Ethical questions relating to moral agency, theological anthropology, andcommunity obligation will be re-evaluated from the perspective of children and youth. Christian ethics has most often focused on adult subjects, thus missing critical insights about moral character and action. Similar to adults, children and youth engage current moral issues including the use of technology, , poverty, consumerism, sexuality, racism, and so on. This course asks how children exercise moral agency and grow in their moral capacity, as well as, how adults help or hinder child/youth development as they become capable, well-informed, and confident moral agents. While the course resources are multidisciplinary, the core methodologies and questions are situated in Christian social ethics.

        Promotes an articulation of the Biblical and theological rationale for congregational growth in the contemporary post-modern context. It uses family systems theory as a means to understand congregational dynamics as well as a systems approach to change. In addition to examining several change strategies, the participants will develop an audit of their congregation using the resources of Bill Easum's congregational audit. This audit will then be used by the participant to chart out a set of priorities based on the strengths, needs, and readiness of the congregation for change. Participants reflect critically on pastoral leadership and congregational context, offer professional feedback to one another, and give attention to a systems approach as a basis for planning and implementing parish ministry

In class application of this methodology will help students shape and form projects that build-up "the people of God". The students will employ theological and ministerial skills to identify a problem, analyze it, and, in conjunction with an increased awareness of his/her context, use these skills to imagine possible and justifiable solutions to problems of how to be the people of God in an increasingly problematic world.

Just as a pulpit/ambo is located between the font and the table, this course will focus on preaching as the intersection where "commonplace things are lifted up for holy use". Sermon preparation and evaluation is required as part of the course assignment.

        This Internet-based course surveys the history of Christianity from its ancient origins to the present. Emphasizing the traditions of Western Christianity, we attend to questions of Christian identity in the ancient Mediterranean, in medieval and early modern Europe, and, from the sixteenth century, in North America. Students develop skills of critical historical interpretation through engagement with a variety of primary texts: literary, visual, and aural. In twelve weekly modules, students encounter key themes and concepts in the history of Christianity, as they interact with online media and with the instructor and other students in web-based activities and discussions. Thematically, the course focuses on social and cultural backgrounds of Christian traditions, including; challenges presented by religious diversity; shifting practices of worship and scriptural interpretation; the spread of Christianity across diverse geographical and cultural terrains; womens roles in shaping Christianity; relations between churches and state institutions; the emergence of Protestant traditions; and Christian variety in U.S. American contexts. 
        <br>The course is designed to meet the Church History requirement for Basic Graduate Theological Studies in the United Methodist Church.It does NOT meet the M. Div. church history requirement.

       </dt> 
       <dd>
        Postmoderns do not "know" life like moderns "knew" the world. In postmodern culture, knowing proceeds through imaginative leaps, loops, and lurches that come to life almost holographically around performative metaphors. This course explores the abductive hermeneutic that all communicators to contemporary audiences need to claim and clarify. This abductive epistemology moves worship beyond the discussion over induction or deduction, over theory-based or data-oriented. Knowing is not linear movement either from (deduction) or towards (induction) propositions. We will review the multiple modes of cognition, and propose an EPIC methodology that moves preaching into more experiential, participatory, image-rich, and connective directions and dimensions.

        This course aims to explore the nature of virtualization as a feature of postmodern culture with regard to its implications on faith formation and Christian ministry in the new millennium. Students will be introduced to the recent discussions on virtualization, including a theory that the virtual is not the opposite of the real but a fecund and powerful mode of being that expands the process of creation and opens up the future. Understanding the virtual as a legitimate mode of being (along with the possible, the real, the actual), and virtualization as a change of identity displacing the center of ontological gravity of the object, this course seeks to develop ways of expressing and nurturing Christian formation in postmodern ministry.

        Recent cultural transitions are affecting not only how we work, learn, and socialize; they are affecting how we do ministry and nurture congregational community. Many congregations today consist not only of five generations, but three worldviews that reflect the influence of three major communication eras. This course addresses what is happening in today's congregations and why as we explore what it means when we have three worldviews, three sets of expectations, and three perspectives on what it means to belong and to participate. As we look at the collaborative approaches being introduced by the digital age, we will explore opportunities for congregational leaders to take advantage of these opportunities for leading their congregations in ministry. This course will give students the opportunity to develop: a) an understanding of the affects of the three communication eras on congregational life, and b) a leadership approach that will facilitate a shared vision among congregational sense of hope, purpose, and mission in the lives of congregational members.

Appropriate pastoral care includes crisis intervention and recovery and empowerment strategies. This course seeks to apply biblical values and psychological principles to at least three critical situations: responding to 1) inner city/urban problems, 2) people with AIDS and the terminally ill, 3) survivors of trauma and abuse.

        The course examines the psychological understanding of narcissism by surveying the progress of the theory of the psychology of the self developed by Heinz Kohut in conjunction with other theories such as Freudian and Object Relations theories. It engages in a psychological understanding of narcissistic phenomena in a developmental, rather than pathological, perspective. It thus proposes that individual and societal health is achieved by the transformation, and not elimination, of narcissistic behaviors, i.e., the transformation of an immature into a more mature narcissism characterized by creativity, sense of humor, sense of finitude, empathy, and wisdom. It also explores its theoretical implications on the lives of historical figures as well as ethical, pastoral, and theological issues. It works toward developing an ethic/theology of compassion that can address pastoral issues.

        Statisticians tell us that millions of children around the globe are suffering physical and psychological traumas. Psychologists tell us that what constitutes "healing" for a child who has undergone trauma is still a mystery. How are religious communities to respond to these children in crisis? How do we create awareness? How do we minister to children and their families? For the church, the Bible has been the book most often turned to for guidance in times of trouble. But does the Bible really address the needs of children? In this course we attempt to explore various dimensions of childhood trauma and how the Bible can be both a weapon and a tool when it comes to the care of children.

        We are spirits that matter. (source unknown) Classrooms are a primary context for teaching Christian faith in theological education and the local church. As such, many schools and churches struggle with the predominance of theory over practice even for those aware of the necessity for germane experiences of spirituality in preparation for effective ministry. In this course, we will explore what it means to bring the experience of spirituality into classrooms for the enabling of liberative learning. The aim of the course is to assist teachers and church leaders to become a community of interpretation to expand our collective literacy concerning issues of Christian spirituality and teaching. A primary resource for this course will be spiritual experience. Our primary questions are: How do we nurture teachers who are smart at their own discipline as well as skilled in discernment, intuition, and wisdom? What does it mean to create classrooms that honor the necessity of both interior and exterior life?

        Reformed theology is a conversation carried on by a global family of churches who claim to some degree today the inheritance of the 16th- century Reformation in Switzerland. Important to Reformed faith and practice are a body of historical confessions that have helped give shape to the tradition. What makes it Reformed, however, is a commitment to a way of doing things theologically in the church and in life. Ecclesia reformata semper reformanda--the church reformed and always reforming--is the motto of the movement. This course will provide an opportunity to explore the contours of Reformed theology, paying attention to its historical formations, contemporary expressions, and pastoral implications for church and community. The course is designed to be particularly relevant to those in Presbyterian, Reformed, and United Church of Christ communions who are seeking ordination. Everyone, however, is invited. After all, who doesn't believe the church ought to be always reforming?

       <dd>
        An examination of writings of two theologians of the liberal tradition. Schleiermacher (1768--1834) inaugurated the liberal strain in Protestantism with his revolutionary 1799 Speeches in which he shaped the emergent contours of a universal religion. In his 1822 Christian Faith he unfolded a phenomenology of consciousness that fulfilled the Kantian project for religion. Tillich (1886--1965), referring to Schleiermacher as his spiritual grandfather, developed an existential theology in dialogue with contemporary culture and in some respects brought the grand liberal tradition to a high water mark. His major work of 1951-1963, Sytematic Theology Vols. I, II, III, will be the focus of the course's reflections.

        Who is he, and what do his life, death, and resurrection mean to us? This Christological question is answered in many ways within the New Testament and in the early church, leading to the development of many Christological interpretations in the Church. Other contextual and cultural interpretations of Christ emerged when Christianity moved into Asia, Africa and Latin America . This course attempts to map and critically evaluate these developments.

The course examines some modern and contemporary theologians and philosophers such as Hegel, Tillich, Whitehead, Deleuze, Hodgson, Clayton, Keller, Schneider, etc. This course is a seminar designed for intermediate to advanced students.

        This course is an introduction to the major themes and figures of Asian Christian theologies, particularly focusing on the two predominant themes of liberation and indigenization. During the last several decades, as the younger churches in the Asian continent came into their own, theologies have emerged there responding to the task of socio-political liberation from both the internal and the external colonial domination on the one hand and cultural liberation (indigenization) from the Western cultural hegemony on the other. This course examines some of the most renowned examples of Asian liberation theologies, such as Minjung theology and Dalit theology, and the various intercultural and interreligious attempts at theologies of indigenization represented by figures such as Aloysius Pieris, Heup Young Kim, and M. Thomas Thangaraj

Students will first read selected primary sources, focusing on the classical figures of Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi, Laozi, and Zhuangzi, and the central themes of Tao, Heaven, ren, ritual, self-cultivation, ziran, and wuwei, and then proceed to examine some examples of Confucian-Christian and/or Daoist-Christian dialogue. Students will also be introduced to methods for the emerging field of comparative theology, notably Robert. C. Neville, Francis X. Clooney, and James Fredericks.

We will closely examine selections from his Phenomenology of Spirit, Philosophy of Right, Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, and other relevant texts, with a view to assessing critically the theological contribution of his dialectical approach to the modern and late-modern split between subject and object, ideal and material, spirit and nature, reason and history, master and slave, and divine and creaturely. We will also examine Hegel's tremendous influence on Marx's humanism as evinced in his early works, especially The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, an

        This advanced seminar attempts to explore an alternative philosophical framework in which to articulate the Christian doctrine of God.

The focus will be on whether the concept of Gi can point beyond the metacosmic/cosmic distinction -- that is, the ontological/cosmological distinction -- that has characterized the classical theism of Christian doctrine of God. The work undertaken in this course will be complementary to the contemporary movements within Christian theology which question the asymmetrically binary constructions of classical Western thought, i.e., of transcendence and immanence, spirit and nature, mind and body, ideal and material, eternity and time, permanence and change etc., with the accompanying political and ecological ramifications. The nature of this course will be comparative theology and comparative philosophy of religion, with
