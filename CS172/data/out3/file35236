  <h3><a id="A"></a>PURPOSE: </h3> 
  <p>To establish the University’s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment in all forms, sexual misconduct, relationship violence and retaliation related to reports of such conduct.</p> 
  <h3><a id="B"></a>POLICY STATEMENT: </h3> 
  <p>The University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons.&nbsp; It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.&nbsp; Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.</p> 
  <p>This policy shall not be construed to restrict academic freedom at the University, nor shall it be to restrict constitutionally protected expression.</p> 
  <p>Conduct prohibited by this policy may also violate Title IX and Title VII, and other applicable federal and state law. Dr. Kenneth Lehrman III, Vice Provost for Affirmative Action is the Title IX Coordinator.&nbsp; Deputy Title IX Coordinators include Danny Shaha, Senior Director of the Office of Student Conduct and Kim Lantz Yoder, Equity Officer, Penn State College of Medicine. &nbsp;Additional information about how to contact these individuals, or to otherwise pursue or report a violation of this Policy, is set forth below.</p> 
  <h3><a id="C"></a>DEFINITIONS: </h3> 
  <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
   <li> <p><strong>Discrimination</strong> is conduct of any nature that denies an individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of an individual’s employment, education, or living environment, because of the individual’s age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Harassment </strong>means behavior consisting of physical or verbal conduct that substantially interferes with an individual’s employment, education or access to University programs, activities or opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harassment may include, but is not limited to, verbal or physical attacks, graphic or written statements, threats, or slurs.&nbsp;Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited Harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs and the status of the individuals involved.</p> <p>Any type of Harassment is prohibited at the University. To constitute prohibited Harassment which can lead to discipline under this Policy, however, the conduct must be such that it detrimentally affects the individual in question and would detrimentally affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong> is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwanted, inappropriate, or unconsented to.&nbsp; Any type of Sexual Harassment is prohibited at the University.</p> <p>Sexual harassment when committed by a student can lead to discipline under the Code of Conduct.&nbsp; The precise definitions of the Code of Conduct should be reviewed and applied when a student is accused of or commits harassment.&nbsp; (See Student Code of Conduct).</p> <p>Sexual Harassment committed by an employee or third party can lead to discipline or corrective action when:</p> 
    <ol> 
     <li>Submission to such conduct is made implicitly or explicitly a condition for employment, promotion, grades, academic status, or participation in the University’s activities; or</li> 
     <li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment or academic or other decisions affecting an individual; or</li> 
     <li>Such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to substantially interfere with the harassed individual’s employment, education or access to University programs, activities and opportunities, or creates a hostile or offensive environment for that individual or others.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li><p><strong>Consensual Relationships</strong></p> <p>Romantic and/or sexual relationships between faculty and students, staff and students or supervisors and subordinate employees are strongly discouraged.&nbsp; Such relationships have the potential for adverse consequences, including the filing of charges of sexual harassment.&nbsp; Given the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the relationship where one party has the power to give grades, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases or performance evaluations, the consensual nature of the relationship is inherently suspect.</p> <p>Even when both parties have consented to the relationship, there may be perceptions of conflicts of interest or unfair treatment of others. Such perceptions undermine the atmosphere of trust essential to the educational process or the employment relationship. Accordingly, the person in the position of supervision or academic responsibility must promptly report the relationship to his or her immediate supervisor.&nbsp; Once the consensual relationship is reported, the immediate supervisor is responsible for eliminating or mitigating the conflict of interest to the fullest feasible extent and ensuring that fair and objective processes are in place for decisions relative to grading, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases, or performance evaluations.&nbsp; The new supervisory or academic arrangement should be documented.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Sexual Misconduct </strong>is a form of sexual harassment and refers to sexual offenses including but not limited to rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual exploitation, sexual coercion and any other forms of nonconsensual sexual activity.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Sexual misconduct can be committed by strangers, acquaintances and family members, as well as casual and long-term dating partners.</p> <p>Sexual assault includes, but is not limited to, attempted or unwanted sexual activity, such as sexual touching and fondling.&nbsp; This includes the touching of an unwilling person’s intimate parts (defined as genitalia, groin, breast or buttock, or clothing covering them), or forcing an unwilling person to touch another’s intimate parts.</p> <p>Sexual exploitation includes, but is not limited to, prostituting another person, non-consensual visual or audio recording of sexual activity, non-consensual distribution of photos, images or information of an individual’s sexual activity or intimate body parts, non-consensual voyeurism, coercing someone against their will to engage in sexual activity, or knowingly transmitting sexually transmitted disease (STD) without disclosing STD status.</p> <p>Consent must be informed, freely given and mutual.&nbsp; If coercion, intimidation, threats or physical force are used there is no consent.&nbsp; If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent: this includes impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol or drug consumption, or being asleep or unconscious.&nbsp; Inducement of incapacitation of another with the intent to affect the ability of an individual to consent or refuse to consent to sexual contact almost always, if not always, negates consent.&nbsp; Silence does not necessarily constitute consent.&nbsp; Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over an alleged victim may be a factor in determining consent.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Stalking </strong>is a<strong> </strong>course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his/her safety or the safety of others, or to suffer emotional distress.&nbsp; Stalking may include repeatedly following, harassing, threatening, or intimidating another by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device or method.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Dating Violence </strong>means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim.&nbsp; The existence of such a relationship will be based on the length and type of relationship and the frequency of interaction with the persons involved in the relationship.&nbsp; It is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of dating violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Domestic Violence</strong> includes crimes of violence committed against a victim by:&nbsp; (i) a current or former spouse; (ii) a person with whom the victim shares a child; (iii) a person who is or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse; (iv) a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim; or (v) any other person against whom the victim is protected under Pennsylvania’s domestic and family violence laws.&nbsp; It is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of domestic violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Retaliation</strong>, as defined in University Policy <a href="/policies/AD67.html">AD67</a>, is also prohibited by this policy and may subject the individual who retaliates in violation of this or other University policy to discipline or sanctions. </p></li>
