        <p>Every business needs to have a website – service industries included. Professionals such as doctors and lawyers can all benefit from having a functional website.</p> 
        <p>Unfortunately, many people buy into “if you build it, they will come” myth. This is not true. In order to have a <a title="Kotton Grammers Lawyer services" href="http://kottongrammer.com/lawyer-seo/">successful website</a>, lawyers will need to market their services by using SEO.</p> 
        <h2>What is SEO and How Does it Help Websites?</h2> 
        <p>SEO or search engine optimization is strategy used by webmasters to get on the front page of search engine results. Without it, the site will be competing against billions of other websites on the internet.</p> 
        <p>Being past the third page of search results is bad news. Studies have proven that consumers rarely look past the first couple of search page results when they are buying a product or service.</p> 
        <p>SEO ensures that companies like law firms are visible. This results in more web traffic. Sites with high traffic levels are more likely to get regularly customers. In short, a professionally designed website which ranks well in search engines can increase a law firm’s bottom line.</p> 
        <h2>SEO Tips for Law Firms</h2> 
        <p>Listed below are some of the more common SEO techniques law firms can implement on their site.</p> 
        <p>– Complete <a title="meta tags" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element">META tags</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11" src="http://www.pubd.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/574429291-300x300.jpg" alt="Lawyer Marketing" width="300" height="300">. These tags tell search engines what the website is about and which services the law firm offers. This information helps search engines match the site content with web searches.</p> 
        <p>– Include the location of the law firm in the contact details. By having the name, address and phone number of the company on the contact page, lawyers ensure locals know how to contact the firm.</p> 
        <p>– Use a site template which is clean, professional and easy to navigate. The amount of time a visitor spends on the site will help search engines decide if it is useful. High bounce rates means that customers are coming to the site and not finding what they need. Poor design and navigational problems often make web visitors leave.</p> 
        <p>– Limit advertisements and do not place too many ads on the website. Search engines tend to label sites with lots of advertising as “spammy”.</p> 
        <p>– Build backlinks. Sites that have been linked to by other popular websites are considered reputable.</p> 
        <p>– Use keywords. When a keyword matches with a users search term, the site will come up on search results.</p> 
        <h2>Remember “Content is King”</h2> 
        <p>The phrase “content is king” has been thrown around in the online marketing world for years. It essentially means that if websites have something to offer customers, visitors will eventually find the website. Good search engines place a higher premium on websites that offer content which provides value to visitors.</p>
