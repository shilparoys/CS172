          <h3>University Transfer Planning</h3> 
          <div id="planning"> 
           <p>Working closely with their academic advisor, students develop a personal transfer plan based on their major and their specific destination transfer universities. Advisors help students understand the university admission process. They also offer valuable guidance in selecting appropriate transfer options. GRCC has developed Transfer Planning Guides that serve as a roadmap of coursework. The Transfer Planning Guide is a planning tool that allows students to know where they are and where they will be during every step of their education at Green River.</p> 
           <p>Sample Transfer Planning Guides for:</p>

           </ul> 
           <p>During the first two years of study, students take a combination of general education classes and introductory classes in their major. During their final two years at university, students take upper-level classes in their major and any remaining general education classes. </p>

               <p><i>One and a half years ago, before I came to the States, I imagined Green River as an isolated community college in the middle of the forest, gloomy rainy days, and scary instructors. It's funny though, how my perspective changed. Studying at Green River has been a great experience! Green River not only offered a great education, but also offered a warm and welcoming community where I could grow and feel a sense of family. I'm going to miss GRCC a lot: the people, the jogging trails, the environment...everything. I would really like to thank everyone for all their advice, encouragement and support. Green River really pushed me to be the very best that I can be.</i></p>

Supervisors and co-workers at International Programs were the warmest people I have ever met. Last but not least, my friends here at GRCC are those I am very proud of, and I hope to keep them in my life.

I never fathomed attending a community college before; this decision surprised and left me unsettled. I made the necessary change, but felt frustrated and disoriented; I wanted to return to my standard routine. However, my time at Green River was a time of transition. I learned to utilize time efficiently, make independent decisions, and seek advice from faculty which was a rewarding process. I developed a greater sense of identity, honed my abilities, and built my ambitions. At GRCC, I met a lot of wonderful people who gave me so much help, such as my adviser Helen Kwon, my boss, Kai and my political science professor Allison Jansen and economic professor Mark Blasdell. My life at Green River gave me a memorable and solid foundation. Sometimes, change is inevitable; progress is optional. And Green River well prepared me for the future. I am truly thankful and grateful. </i></p>

Green River's University Transfer Program is eventually what sold me on the idea of studying abroad. It allowed me to spend two amazing years at Green River Community College where I experienced a diverse curriculum, small classrooms and instructors that offer personal attention to students. In addition, the university transfer program helped me organize my studies and prepare me for any university I wanted to go to. My personal advisor helped me with various difficult decisions both academic and otherwise. I've grown as a student and as person. I owe much of this amazing period in my life to Green River Community College. </i></p>

Green River has an awesome advising team who work tirelessly to ensure the success of its international students. There are a lot of opportunities offered by international programs, such as volunteer activities and Foundation for Success Peer Mentoring, to exercise the leadership skills for students. The lectures at GRCC are delivered in small to medium sized classes supported by labs and state-of-the-art technologies. From an academic standpoint, GRCC has outstanding Engineering faculty who prepare their students for getting into their dream schools. Therefore, I highly recommend GRCC to international students who want to study in America and transfer to world-renowned universities. </i></p>

For the past 2 years, I enjoyed the diverse student body and the faculty who are dedicated and willing to offer students their best by sharing their knowledge and experience. I do not regret that I chose to study at GRCC because I learned and cultivated integrity, organizational skills, independence, patience, and leadership. All these things helped me to take one more step forward in building my personality.

               <p><i>When I came to Green River, I didn't know what to expect. We don't have community colleges or Associate degrees in Singapore. At Green River, people come from all walks of life. There are parents returning to classes with their children who are completing high school, grandparents wanting to continue their education, people from the workforce who need re-training, others who take classes for the fun of learning. It's fantastic; it's real. That's how society is - made of people with many different aspirations. I found a warm and accepting community willing to extend me many opportunities, learn about my culture, and hear my ideas. On my first day at school, Ross Jennings (VP of Int'l Prog) told us to say yes to new experiences. His advice got me into so much trouble - I started getting involved in Student Senate, clubs and CLEO. Keeping his message in mind helped me grow, and I learned to embrace change and seize opportunities. My supportive instructors, advisors, supervisors and friends have also been amazing people willing to share their wealth of experience and advice. Two years ago, I was on a gap year after high school, working to save money while trying to figure out my next step. I never would have imagined winning any awards or being admitted to so many schools. Yes, I received many rejection letters as well, but Green River has taught me to put myself out there and dare to dream. </i></p>

The small, but strong community is always encouraging, and there is a bountiful of resources that students can tap on (be it tutoring or student activities). Becoming active on campus was one of the best decisions I've made in my time here at Green River and I highly encourage everyone to do the same. The leadership experience will nurture you into leaders of character and the experiences you gain will broaden your perspectives.</i></p>

               <p><i>The famous Aesop once said in his Fables, "Heaven helps those who help themselves". In fact, Green River Community College does offer its students a rich spectrum of academics, dedicated faculty and a warm environment. During my time here, I was lucky to be able to maximize these opportunities which allowed me to fortify my educational experience and personal enrichment. I am eternally grateful for meeting the people who guided me towards my dream of attending the University of Pennsylvania. Not to say there weren't obstacles involved, I had more problems than there are security officers on campus, personally, emotionally and mentality. Fortunately, as I mentioned earlier, there were people I met at Green River who will go on to be my allies for the rest of my life. In my humble opinion, that is where I truly got my money's worth. </i></p>

               <p><i>The High School Completion Plus Program was really helpful. During the transfer process, universities ask for university transcripts and a diploma. I could send both. It is also easier to apply for internships. Almost all of them require a High School Diploma. It really makes it easier to show them the diploma from GRCC (so I don't have to translate and legalize my transcript). The other benefit is that international students can save a lot of money being enrolled in this program. My goal is to work for the United Nations in the future.</i></p>
