       <br> In a recent public policy course students did projects to answer urgent questions from United Way. What were the effects of post-recession budget cuts on pre-school education? Is it better for developmentally disabled people to be cared for in facilities or in family homes?

Not only will it serve as a means of pulling together the different strands of political science into a coherent whole, but it will also allow for effective evaluation of students' ability to both think about and apply what they have learned in previous classes. It will be taught in seminar format. When there are two sections taught in the same semester, the sections will have shared speakers and faculty, and the two groups will occasionally be brought together for larger sessions, talks, and projects. Assignments for the course will consist of essays and a major paper. Students also participate in analysis of a major political event. The analysis includes oral presentation by each student in a seminar at the end of the term.</p>

                <p>An examination of public policy issues in terms of the criteria typically used in policy analysis, e.g., political dynamics, costs and benefits, decision making, administration, and budget implications. The specific issues vary according to the material available on them and their timeliness. Thus, in some years, the focus might be trade policy or economic policy more generally, while in other years, domestic social policy could be the focus. The central goal of exploring the issue using policy analysis criteria remains constant.

                <p>This course will analyze both the politics and the policy of schooling in the United States. On the political side, we will explore the debate over the purposes of public education and the use of education as an electoral issue, as well as the individuals, groups, and institutions that compete to control schools, and how and where they seek to advance their different interests and values. On the policy side, we will analyze the impact of democratic control, federalism, and checks and balances on the provision of education in the U.S. and how and why school governance has evolved over time. The course will also examine the debates over specific school reforms such as: standards and testing, equalization of school finance, school choice, and the No Child Left Behind Act, as well as the unique challenges facing urban schools.</p>

                <p>This course will examine the role of race in American politics and its contemporary significance to the nation's citizens, politicians, and governmental institutions. Questions will include: What are the primary intra- and inter-group dynamics that shape contemporary minority politics? How do the politics of race intersect with the politics of class and gender? What opportunities and challenges exist in mobilizing the members of minority groups for political action in the U.S.? What role have racial issues and attitudes played in the electoral strategies of political parties and candidates and in the electoral choices of voters? How do the structures and processes of American political institutions affect the efforts of minority groups to secure political influence? How has the rise to power of minority politicians-particularly in many urban areas-affected policymaking? How successful have minority groups been in their quest to use government to expand economic and educational opportunity? How are demographic forces likely to reshape the politics of race and -American politics more generally- in the 21st century?.</p>

                <p>The theory and practice of international organizations (IOs) is a dynamic and increasingly important dimension of world politics. Scholars debate whether IOs serve as venues in which learning processes can occur and expectations about norms of international interaction can be created and reinforced, or whether they are merely another venue in which states pursue their national interests. This course will provide an introduction to the field, focusing on the role of IOs in three principal areas: peace and security, human rights, and humanitarian and development assistance. It will serve as a particularly relevant class for students who may want to participate in the UN semester, as it will provide a grounding in various theories of IOs and their value in the international system.</p>

                <p>Americans have paid closer attention to terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks. However, terrorism is neither new nor a distinctive threat to the United States. In fact, terrorist attacks have been commonplace since 1945. This course presents an overview of terrorism's evolution in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This course is divided into four parts. Part one provides a historical overview of terrorism and distinguishes it from other forms of political violence. Part two compares and contrasts ethno-nationalists and religious terrorist organizations, showing that both groups, while informed by different mindsets, use terrorist tactics in an attempt to achieve clear political ends. Part three examines the evolving strategic logic of suicide terrorism. Part four shows how the forces of globalization are changing the scope and strategies terrorist groups employ.</p>

                <p>Environmental issues extend beyond international borders.&nbsp; Because of that, finding effective, enduring solutions to environmental problems requires engaging the international political arena.&nbsp; Nations enter into global, regional, and bilateral agreements to address environmental problems they confront.&nbsp; While negotiating the international political system is important, not much can happen at this level without the consent of participating nations.&nbsp; Thus, domestic politics plays an important role in international environmental agreements.&nbsp; With this basic dynamic in mind, this course examines the development of international environmental policies, their effectiveness, their shortcomings, and prospects for the future.</p>

Aimed specifically at the liberal arts context, the course approaches these legal materials historically and geographically. The first half of the semester sets out the ramifications of the equal sovereignty of nation- states in this state-centered system. The second half explores the reach of these sovereign states into other states' territories, into the oceans around us, and the universe beyond. The tensions between this system of sovereignty and recent developments in international commercial, environmental and human rights law are a recurring theme of the course.</p>

                <p>This class examines how and why states have worked throughout history to wage both war and peace. Although it is often assumed that peace exists when there is an absence of war, closer inquiry shows that real peace is the product of effort and planning rather than a default status. Moreover, war is often not the result of purposeful policy, rather an accident of misperception, error, and ambiguity. The class will examine a wide variety of time periods, ranging from ancient Greece to current events in the Middle East, with special emphasis on understanding the objectives of and motivations for war as well as the requirements for peace. One question the class will pose is whether war leads to peace, as we might expect, or perhaps, paradoxically, whether peace can lead to war. It will also look at the contemporary challenge of terrorism and how that may change state behaviors.</p>

Various approaches to mediation and their effectiveness will be addressed, as will the sustainability of negotiated versus military settlements and the effectiveness of peacekeeping and peace building. The course will also consider philosophical debates on the propriety of intervention in light of traditional norms of international relations, particularly sovereignty and noninterference, and the difficulty of reconciling humanitarian interests with the rules governing state behaviors.</p>

                <p>Torture has become a subject of much debate in the post-9/11 world. In this course, we start with this fascination with the subject to historically, philosophically, and conceptually analyze the debates on torture. The aim is to analyze the different dimensions of torture: its existence in different societies, its nature, its relationship with pain and truth, its impact, and finally the control of the state over bodies and lives in modern society.</p>

                <p>Democratic theory is one of the most important themes of contemporary political science. Democratization is a vital phenomenon studied by political scientists and the health of established democracies is an ongoing point discussed within the discipline. This course examines the historical debates that have animated political theory for over two thousand years and helps place those debates in a contemporary context. After providing that background, students are introduced to many 20th and 21st century theorists and the theoretical discourse as it has developed in the last 50 years.</p>

                <p>This is a course on contemporary theories of liberalism and conservatism. Two of the most important philosophies of politics of the 20th century and the 21st century, particularly in the United States, are variations of liberalism and classic conservative thought. This course introduces students to those debates via direct readings of major 20th century or contemporary political theorists. The course also includes various counter theorists in the Marxist, post-modernist and feminist traditions who critique the dominant philosophies of the era. This is a writing intensive seminar and students should be prepared to write a significant number of papers of varying length and will be expected to extensively revise their work.</p>

                <p>This course examines the structure and functioning of the United States Supreme Court the theories about judicial decision making, and legal and political debates on civil rights. Following the discussions on judicial review, federalism and separation of powers, the course will look historically on the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the equal protection clause in relation to race, gender, culture, and immigration among other issues. Discussion will focus not only on landmark cases in constitutional law but also on the ways in which other legal actors, such as lawyers and interest groups, play a role in determining the nature and outcome of cases. We will look throughout at the relationship between law and politics as well as at the socio-cultural context in which judicial decisions are made.</p>

                <p>Torture has become a subject of much debate in the post-9/11 world. In this course, we start with this fascination with the subject to historically, philosophically, and conceptually analyze the debates on torture. The aim is to analyze the different dimensions of torture: its existence in different societies, its nature, its relationship with pain and truth, its impact, and finally the control of the state over bodies and lives in modern society.</p>

                <p>This is a course on contemporary theories of liberalism and conservatism. Two of the most important philosophies of politics of the 20th century and the 21st century, particularly in the United States, are variations of liberalism and classic conservative thought. This course introduces students to those debates via direct readings of major 20th century or contemporary political theorists. The course also includes various counter theorists in the Marxist, post-modernist and feminist traditions who critique the dominant philosophies of the era. This is a writing intensive seminar and students should be prepared to write a significant number of papers of varying length and will be expected to extensively revise their work.</p>

                <p>Democratic theory is one of the most important themes of contemporary political science. Democratization is a vital phenomenon studied by political scientists and the health of established democracies is an ongoing point discussed within the discipline. This course examines the historical debates that have animated political theory for over two thousand years and helps place those debates in a contemporary context. After providing that background, students are introduced to many 20th and 21st century theorists and the theoretical discourse as it has developed in the last 50 years.</p>

                 <p>The theory and practice of international organizations (IOs) is a dynamic and increasingly important dimension of world politics. Scholars debate whether IOs serve as venues in which learning processes can occur and expectations about norms of international interaction can be created and reinforced, or whether they are merely another venue in which states pursue their national interests. This course will provide an introduction to the field, focusing on the role of IOs in three principal areas: peace and security, human rights, and humanitarian and development assistance. It will serve as a particularly relevant class for students who may want to participate in the UN semester, as it will provide a grounding in various theories of IOs and their value in the international system.</p>

Aimed specifically at the liberal arts context, the course approaches these legal materials historically and geographically. The first half of the semester sets out the ramifications of the equal sovereignty of nation- states in this state-centered system. The second half explores the reach of these sovereign states into other states' territories, into the oceans around us, and the universe beyond. The tensions between this system of sovereignty and recent developments in international commercial, environmental and human rights law are a recurring theme of the course.</p>

In fact, terrorist attacks have been commonplace since 1945. This course presents an overview of terrorism's evolution in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This course is divided into four parts. Part one provides a historical overview of terrorism and distinguishes it from other forms of political violence. Part two compares and contrasts ethno-nationalists and religious terrorist organizations, showing that both groups, while informed by different mindsets, use terrorist tactics in an attempt to achieve clear political ends. Part three examines the evolving strategic logic of suicide terrorism. Part four shows how the forces of globalization are changing the scope and strategies terrorist groups employ.</p>

The course will also consider philosophical debates on the propriety of intervention in light of traditional norms of international relations, particularly sovereignty and noninterference, and the difficulty of reconciling humanitarian interests with the rules governing state behaviors.</p>

                 <p>This class examines how and why states have worked throughout history to wage both war and peace. Although it is often assumed that peace exists when there is an absence of war, closer inquiry shows that real peace is the product of effort and planning rather than a default status. Moreover, war is often not the result of purposeful policy, rather an accident of misperception, error, and ambiguity. The class will examine a wide variety of time periods, ranging from ancient Greece to current events in the Middle East, with special emphasis on understanding the objectives of and motivations for war as well as the requirements for peace. One question the class will pose is whether war leads to peace, as we might expect, or perhaps, paradoxically, whether peace can lead to war. It will also look at the contemporary challenge of terrorism and how that may change state behaviors.</p>

                 <p>Torture has become a subject of much debate in the post-9/11 world. In this course, we start with this fascination with the subject to historically, philosophically, and conceptually analyze the debates on torture. The aim is to analyze the different dimensions of torture: its existence in different societies, its nature, its relationship with pain and truth, its impact, and finally the control of the state over bodies and lives in modern society.</p>

                 <p>Policymakers are dependent on intelligence to help guide and inform their decision making. Indeed, intelligence provides a critical support role in all aspects of foreign policy and national security; it is often difficult to understand US actions without understanding not only the intelligence that was provided, but the process through which it came about. The purpose of this class is to provide students with an understanding of the roles and processes through which the intelligence community shapes national policy and the resulting impact on international relations in general. The course will not only address theoretical and practical bases and implications of intelligence, but will invite practitioners to discuss their experiences and their view of policy.</p>

                <p>This course will examine the role of race in American politics and its contemporary significance to the nation's citizens, politicians, and governmental institutions. Questions will include: What are the primary intra- and inter-group dynamics that shape contemporary minority politics? How do the politics of race intersect with the politics of class and gender? What opportunities and challenges exist in mobilizing the members of minority groups for political action in the U.S.? What role have racial issues and attitudes played in the electoral strategies of political parties and candidates and in the electoral choices of voters? How do the structures and processes of American political institutions affect the efforts of minority groups to secure political influence? How has the rise to power of minority politicians-particularly in many urban areas-affected policymaking? How successful have minority groups been in their quest to use government to expand economic and educational opportunity? How are demographic forces likely to reshape the politics of race and -American politics more generally- in the 21st century?.</p>

               <p>This course integrates the political science major and provides a unified culminating experience for students. Not only will it serve as a means of pulling together the different strands of political science into a coherent whole, but it will also allow for effective evaluation of students' ability to both think about and apply what they have learned in previous classes. It will be taught in seminar format. When there are two sections taught in the same semester, the sections will have shared speakers and faculty, and the two groups will occasionally be brought together for larger sessions, talks, and projects. Assignments for the course will consist of essays and a major paper. Students also participate in analysis of a major political event. The analysis includes oral presentation by each student in a seminar at the end of the term.</p>
