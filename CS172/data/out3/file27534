        <h4>1. What is R2T4 on the Web?</h4> 
        <p> <i>Return of Title IV Funds on the Web</i> (R2T4 on the Web) is a product of Federal Student Aid (FSA) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED). R2T4 on the Web is used by FAAs to calculate the earned and unearned portions of Title IV student aid when a student withdraws from a postsecondary institution before completing the period for which the student was paid. An FAA may also use this Web site to track required notifications to the Title IV recipient and to track the recipient’s responses. </p> 
        <p>R2T4 on the Web is a Web-based system that allows participating institutions to perform required calculations and to track required notifications consistent with the federal regulations implementing Section 484B of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (P.L. 105-244, enacted October 7, 1998) for the treatment of Title IV HEA program funds when a student withdraws from an institution. </p> 
        <p>FAAs utilize the functions of R2T4 on the Web through a Web site called<em> FAA Access to CPS Online</em>. This Web site enables FAAs to exchange financial aid information with ED for students who have released FAFSA data to a particular school, for the purpose of awarding financial aid or correcting information provided to obtain financial aid. </p> 
        <p>The statute requires that if a recipient of Title IV grant or loan funds withdraws from an institution after beginning attendance, the school must determine the amount of Title IV HEA program assistance that is earned by the student. If the amount disbursed to the student is greater than the amount the student earned, unearned funds have to be returned to the Title IV programs. If the amount the student was disbursed is less than the amount the student earned, the school must make available to the otherwise eligible recipient the amount of Title IV funds that could have been disbursed as a post-withdrawal disbursement. </p> 
        <p>ED simply stores and maintains the school-entered data in the R2T4 on the Web database in which schools calculate the return of Title IV funds and track the notification and response process. </p>

        <a name="2"></a>
        <h4>2. What information is being collected in R2T4 on the Web and how is it used?</h4> 
        <p> FAAs who choose to use R2T4 on the Web must first register with ED and receive an FSA User ID and password. Registrants must provide specific personal and school identifiers that are authenticated by ED before creating an R2T4 record for you or gaining access to your record later. </p> 
        <p>To create a record and calculate the types and amounts of Title IV aid that you and the school must return to Title IV programs, your FAA must provide data about you. </p> 
        <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
        <blockquote class="norightmargin"> 
         <a name="3"></a>
         <h4>A. Demographic and Withdrawal Information</h4> 
         <p> The demographic information your FAA provides will enable him or her to create an R2T4 record for you and will identify your file among all the R2T4 records created by that particular school. This information includes your Social Security Number (which is required to create a record), your name, and your date of birth. Your withdrawal information determines the point at which you ceased attendance and is used to determine the percentage of the period you were enrolled. The amount of Title IV program assistance that you have earned is based upon the percentage of time that you completed at your school. Your withdrawal information includes: the withdrawal date, the date the institution determined you withdrew (as reported by the institution), and a description of the type of withdrawal. </p> 
         <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
         <a name="4"></a>
         <h4>B. Program of Study Information</h4> 
         <p> Your FAA must add information about your school and the educational program in which you were enrolled before withdrawing, to identify your school’s program type in order to perform the correct R2T4 calculation. This information includes your federal school code, award year, grade level, program type (i.e., credit hour or clock hour), program title, and whether an outside entity requires your school to take attendance. </p> 
         <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
         <a name="5"></a>
         <h4>C. Payment Period or Period of Enrollment Information</h4> 
         <p> The R2T4 calculation is based on the amount of time you completed divided by the total amount of time that was scheduled to be in your payment period or period of enrollment. Schools that measure student enrollment in standard term-based periods (semesters, trimesters, or quarters) must perform the calculation of earned vs. unearned Title IV aid on the basis of a payment period. Schools who measure student enrollment in non-term-based or nonstandard term periods may choose to use either a payment period or period of enrollment for all students in that program. Institutions must consistently use either a payment period or period of enrollment for calculating R2T4 on the Web. The following information is collected by your FAA: school calendar code (which maintains the term start and end dates and institutionally scheduled breaks of 5 or more consecutive days), net number of days in the payment period or period of enrollment, the number of days of an approved leave of absence (if you took one), the clock hours scheduled in the program, the clock hours you completed, whether the R2T4 calculation is based upon a payment period or period of enrollment, and the total number of clock hours or number of days in the payment period or period of enrollment. </p>

         <a name="6"></a>
         <h4>D. Institutional Charges Information</h4> 
         <p> Institutional charges (a charge for tuition and fees, room and board (if charged by the institution), and other educationally-related costs) are the original amounts the school charged you to attend. Your FAA will enter a description and the amount of each institutional charge, the total institutional charges for your program, and the amount of outstanding charges if you are eligible for a post-withdrawal disbursement. </p> 
         <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
         <a name="7"></a>
         <h4>E. Financial Aid Received</h4> 
         <p> Your FAA will enter the types and amounts of Title IV aid that were disbursed (paid toward your institutional charges or to you after all your charges were paid) and the types and amounts that “could have been disbursed” (not yet paid out). The percentage of the payment period or period of enrollment that you attended is multiplied by the total financial aid that was disbursed or could have been disbursed to determine the amount that you are able to retain and the amount that you must return to the Title IV programs. If the amount of Title IV funds that were earned is less than the amount that was disbursed, and you are an otherwise eligible Title IV aid recipient who meets the conditions for a late disbursement, the school must offer you the difference as a post-withdrawal disbursement. </p> 
         <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
         <a name="8"></a>
         <h4>F. The R2T4 Calculation</h4> 
         <p> From the information your FAA provides, R2T4 on the Web will calculate the types and amounts of Title IV aid that must be returned to each program by you and your school and the types and amounts of aid that you earned. FAAs can retrieve your information and the dates of their notifications and your responses from R2T4 on the Web by generating reports contained within the Web product. </p> 
         <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
         <a name="9"></a>
         <h4>G. Dates Notices Sent and Your Response Dates </h4> 
         <p> R2T4 on the Web maintains the dates your FAA provides to track required school notifications to you and your responses to those notifications. Your FAA can enter dates for the following notifications: the date you provided the school with written authorization to credit Title IV aid to your account, the date your school notified you of the amounts and types of Title IV funds that must be returned, the date you responded and your response, post-withdrawal disbursement information (i.e., the dates notices were sent informing you that a credit was applied and/or that a disbursement was available and the dates of your responses, the amount and the date you accepted a post-withdrawal disbursement, and the date the post-withdrawal disbursement was completed). The software also retains the date the return of Title IV funds procedure was completed. </p> 
         <p align="right"><a href="#container" class="anchorToTopLink">Return to top</a></p> 
         <a name="10"></a>
         <p></p>
         <h4>H. School Defined Information</h4> 
         <p> Your FAA may add other information to your record for school use. Some examples include but are not limited to: grade point average, major in college, overpayment status, withdrawal reason, leave of absence reason, and contemporaneous notes regarding your withdrawal process. While the data elements indicated above meet the definition of an “educational record” and are therefore protected by the Family Educational Rights and Protection Act (FERPA), these data are being disclosed to the Department in connection with the Title IV, HEA financial aid that you have received and can be shared with the Department without your prior consent as provided in 34 CFR 99.31(a)(3). These data are necessary for the determination of compliance and consistent with §484B of the HEA, as amended. </p> 
         <p>If your FAA creates or modifies a student’s record, the student record will be identified with the personal FAA information he or she entered when the Web site was accessed. This information includes the FAA’s Social Security Number (the first 5 digits will not be viewable) and your Federal School Code. </p>

        <p>These disclosures may be made on a case-by-case basis. If the Department has complied with the computer matching requirements of the Privacy Act, disclosure also may be made to another agency under a computer matching agreement. </p> 
        <p>There will be no sharing of information for purposes outside of the above disclosure requirements or for anything other than the primary purpose(s) of collecting the information. Any contractor responsible for the operations of this Web site is held to the privacy and security requirements of the Department of Education in the handling of information collected through the Web site. </p> 
        <p>A link to the <a href="Javascript:externalLinks.openURL(externalLinks.PAS_EN);">Privacy Act Statement</a> is provided on the home page of the Web site. </p> 
        <p>As the subject of an account in your name, the Privacy Act affords you the ability to access your account and the right to request the amendment of inaccurate information in your record. You may request the information in your account from the FAA at the school from which you withdrew. A full explanation of your rights under the Privacy Act is set forth in the Department’s <a href="Javascript:externalLinks.openURL(externalLinks.PAR);"> Privacy Act regulations</a>. </p> 
        <p>Each record in this system is indexed and retrieved only by an FAA of the school from which the student withdrew by a student’s Social Security Number or last name. Student records are created and accessed only by an FAA of the school from which the student withdrew. Accordingly, we maintain the information FAAs provide in a system of records protected by the Privacy Act and administer it in accordance with the Act and with the Privacy Act systems of record notice published at 69 Fed. Reg. 44521 (July 26, 2004). [http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/other/2004-3/072604d.html]. The Department of Education, through R2T4 on the Web, is authorized to collect and use the information your FAA provides under the following authorities: </p> 
        <p>The information maintained in the R2T4 on the Web system is authorized under §484B of the HEA. Under §484B of the HEA (20 U.S.C. §1091b), if a recipient of Title IV grant or loan assistance withdraws from an institution during a payment period or period of enrollment in which the student began attendance, a participating institution must determine the amount of grant and loan assistance to be returned to the Title IV programs. </p>

        <h4>5. Voluntary Collection of SSN and other Privacy Protected Information</h4> 
        <p> Providing the information in any case is voluntary on your FAA’s part. However, if he or she chooses not to use R2T4 on the Web, your FAA will still be required to calculate the return of Title IV funds consistent with the Higher Education Act and its implementing regulations. </p>

        <h4>6. What if My FAA Chooses Not to Use R2T4 On the Web?</h4> 
        <p> Using R2T4 on the Web is not required, but we encourage FAAs to make use of this free Web product. The Department endorses R2T4 on the Web as it effectuates the provisions of 20 U.S.C. 1091b, as implemented in 34 CFR 668.22, for the determination of the earned and unearned amounts of Title IV, HEA program funds when a student ceases to be enrolled from an institution prior to the planned completion date. While FAAs may use other software products to calculate the return of Title IV funds, he or she is still required to comply with the HEA and its implementing regulations in their entirety. </p>

        <h4>7. Security</h4> 
        <p> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires the completion of a system security plan in Circular A-130, “Management of Federal Information Resources,” Appendix III, “Security of Federal Automated Information Resources,” and Public Law 100-235, “Computer Security Act of 1987.” The Web site’s system security plan demonstrating its compliance with the IT requirements mandated by federal law and policy was added to ED’s Central Processing System (CPS) security plan when the Web product was released. The security plan contains details regarding the Risk Assessment conducted for the Web site, as well as the security controls (hardware/software/facilities/personnel) in place to mitigate any identified risks to the information collected on the Web site. Management, operational, and technical security controls are in place for the Web site, encompassing personnel, physical environment access, contingency plans, disaster recovery, and identification and authentication procedures. The Web site is currently in the operations/maintenance phase of the life cycle. As such, the following functions are being performed: security operations and administration, operational assurance, audits and monitoring. The System Security Officer (SSO) for the Web site is Valerie Hough (Management and Program Analyst) (202) 377-3166. </p>

        <h4>INTRODUCTION TO PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT</h4> 
        <p> Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L.107-347) requires FSA to complete a Privacy Impact Assessment for each new system that collects information from the public through the Internet. </p> 
        <p>During the Definition Phase of the FSA Solution Lifecycle, the System Security Officer must make sure that the team completes the attached Privacy Impact Assessment Questionnaire, must have it reviewed by the Chief Information Officer or equivalent official, and must file the completed form in the system’s Security Notebook as part of the system’s documentation. This Privacy Impact Assessment must also be made publicly available. </p>
