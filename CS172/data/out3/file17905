            In the hunt for college students, the State University of New York at Fredonia historically has looked north to Buffalo and its suburbs, a 40-minute drive away. Nearly one-fourth of the 5,000 undergraduate students at Fredonia come from Erie County.
           <br>
           <br>But attracting students from 40 minutes south of campus, in Erie, Pa., is a hard sell. Just 18 students from all of Pennsylvania enrolled at Fredonia this academic year.
           <br>
           <br>Despite how close the campus is to the border, the number of Pennsylvania students at Fredonia never has been high. College officials believe that&#x2019;s because Pennsylvania students must pay out-of-state SUNY tuition and fees of $17,390 &#x2013; more than double the cost of the in-state rate at many Pennsylvania public colleges and universities. At the same time, several state colleges and universities in Pennsylvania and Ohio have used tuition discounts to lure significant numbers of students from New York.
           <br>
           <br>Now, admissions officials at Fredonia and another SUNY border college, Alfred State, are looking to balance the playing field as competition accelerates for a shrinking pool of high school graduates. They&#x2019;re asking SUNY officials to allow them to slash out-of-state tuition for Pennsylvania and Ohio students.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;This would be a way to make sure that we&#x2019;re competitive,&#x201d; said Fredonia President Virginia Horvath. &#x201c;When we talk about people attending a regional institution like Fredonia, we shouldn&#x2019;t think of the Pennsylvania border as a type of iron curtain. We are closer to Pennsylvania and Ohio than we are to Rochester and Syracuse.&#x201d; 
           <br>
           <br>The State Legislature would have to approve any changes to tuition, and while allowing individual SUNY campuses to charge so-called &#x201c;differential&#x201d; in-state tuition has been politically untenable, Fredonia and Alfred officials believe their proposal for out-of-state tuition flexibility would not hurt other SUNY colleges and universities.
           <br>
           <br>The issue has gained some traction among SUNY officials, who are examining the issue and may make a recommendation to the SUNY board of trustees.
           <br>
           <br>State Sen. Catharine Young, R-Olean, said she plans to sponsor a bill in the State Senate that would allow Fredonia, Alfred State and SUNY Potsdam, which is near the Canadian border, to lower out-of state rates.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;This is a way to make them more attractive and more competitive to a wider base of students,&#x201d; Young said.
           <br> 
           <b><p>&#x2018;Practically in state&#x2019;</p></b>
           <br> Fredonia wants to draw more students like Laurel Brennan, an 18-year-old freshman theater arts major.
           <br>
           <br>She&#x2019;s one of the few students from Pennsylvania now attending Fredonia. She chose Fredonia for its prominent theater program. 
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so close, I&#x2019;m practically in state,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really enjoying it here.&#x201d;
           <br>
           <br>If she had chosen another major, however, Brennan said she probably would have enrolled in a Pennsylvania school to save money, as did many of her classmates from Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy in Erie. Some students from Pennsylvania don&#x2019;t even consider Fredonia when looking at colleges because of the tuition rate, she said.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;If the price was closer to in-state, it would be something that people would look at more,&#x201d; she said.
           <br>
           <br>Fredonia has proposed lowering its out-of-state rate for Pennsylvania and Ohio students to 1Â½ times the rate of in-state tuition &#x2013; or $9,255 based on 2014-15 SUNY rates. Young and others envision a three-year pilot program to see whether flexibility on out-of-state tuition helps attract more students to Fredonia, Alfred State and Potsdam.
           <br>
           <br>Alfred State College is even closer than Fredonia to the Pennsylvania border, which is about 15 miles from the campus in Alfred, Allegany County.
           <br>
           <br>As a SUNY technology college, Alfred State offers both associate and bachelor&#x2019;s degrees, and the state for years has allowed the college flexibility in setting tuition for out-of-state associate-degree students, largely because community colleges have that kind of flexibility. In their first two years on campus, out-of-state students at Alfred State pay about 65 percent of the regular out-of-state tuition. If they stay to get a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, they pay the regular rate over the final two years. That translates into a savings of $12,000 for the out-of-state student.
           <br>
           <br>Still, Alfred State officials said that an annual rise in the bachelor&#x2019;s out-of-state tuition rate the past five years has had an impact on enrollment. In 2010, Alfred State had 92 students from Pennsylvania. The number slipped to 80 this year.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a direct correlation,&#x201d; said Deborah Goodrich, associate vice president for enrollment management at the college.
           <br>
           <br>Most demographic projections show that through at least 2019, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Vermont, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts are expected to see declines in the number of high school graduates. Projections for New York have been more mixed, but none of them suggests any huge growth, and in Western New York in particular, the state Education Department has projected larger declines than in other parts of the state.
           <br> 
           <b><p>Competitors&#x2019; rates</p></b>
           <br> Private colleges and universities have long discounted tuition to attract students, and public institutions in other states increasingly participate in the practice.
           <br>
           <br>Edinboro University, a Pennsylvania school located about 30 miles from the New York border, pitches a tuition cut of $3,400 per year aimed at New York students. And billboards along the highways of Western New York highways advertise &#x201c;in-state tuition@Cleveland State.&#x201d;
           <br>
           <br>The University of Pittsburgh Bradford, in Pennsylvania six miles from the New York border, urges students from the Southern Tier to &#x201c;Go Beyond New York State&#x201d; by offering in-state tuition for incoming freshman from Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties &#x2013; a savings of $10,816 in 2014-15.
           <br>
           <br>It&#x2019;s just the latest incentive from the University of Pittsburgh Bradford, which draws nearly a quarter of its students from out of state, mostly from New York.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re located right on the state line,&#x201d; said Livingston Alexander, president. &#x201c;We have offered discounts of one form or another throughout our history to students in Western New York.&#x201d;
           <br>
           <br>It&#x2019;s not clear exactly how many Western New York students attend colleges and universities in Pennsylvania, but it&#x2019;s not insignificant, said Horvath.
           <br> 
           <b><p>Broader benefit</p></b>
           <br> Meanwhile, Fredonia has struggled to gain a foothold.
           <br>
           <br>The price tag probably has a lot to do with it, especially when compared with Pennsylvania in-state tuition or the discounts offered by state schools in Ohio, said Kimberlie Dawson, a guidance counselor at Union City High School, located outside Erie, Pa.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had a few students go to Fredonia, just not that many,&#x201d; she said.
           <br>
           <br>Families are more conscious than ever about college costs. And more students are choosing the military or other options instead of attending college right out of high school, she added.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;The costs are scary,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A lot of students are thinking twice.&#x201d;
           <br>
           <br>In addition to helping Fredonia and Alfred State fill empty seats, Horvath and Young said the tuition flexibility could also bring a broader economic benefits to New York, including new young people who stay in the state after they graduate. Upstate New York has been losing population for years. 
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;It could be something that helps New York&#x2019;s workforce,&#x201d; said Horvath.
           <br>
           <br>Out-of-state students also will bring more dollars into the local economies through their presence on campuses like Fredonia, she added. 
           <br>
           <br>The proposed pilot program likely will include protections against out-of-state students taking seats away from in-state students. About 2 percent of Fredonia&#x2019;s students currently come from outside New York, and Young said she would seek to limit the number to no more than 10 percent in the pilot program.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;Our primary market is and will remain Western New York,&#x201d; added Horvath. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as if we&#x2019;re offering seats to people outside New York and Western New Yorkers can&#x2019;t come here.&#x201d;
           <br>
           <br>In fact, Fredonia has some room to grow its enrollment.
           <br>
           <br>&#x201c;When we think of the resources of the campus, and where we have capacity, it makes sense to fill those seats,&#x201d; said Horvath.
