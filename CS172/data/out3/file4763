     <h5><strong> Volume 1, Edition 3, December 2013</strong><br> </h5> 
     <p>It’s that wonderful time of year when the cold, crisp air reminds us that the Christmas season has arrived. Students have been buried in their books, preparing for finals. They welcome being at home for a much-needed break from their studies. </p> 
     <p><img src="images/teri-bradfordrouse.jpg" alt="Teri Bradford Rouse" width="95" height="143">The college is festively decorated for Christmas, and Kerrwood Hall is enchanting with its beautiful Christmas tree, lit wreaths and garland trailing the stairway banisters. If you have never visited Kerrwood at Christmas, you should put it on your bucket list as it’s a glorious sight. <br> </p> 
     <p> We wish you a very merry Christmas, one filled with the miracle of a baby, God made flesh. May He dwell in your hearts this Christmas and in the year to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> </p> 
     <p>Blessings, Teri and the A &amp; P staff <br> </p>

     <p class="txt_dont_wrap"><em>Above: Beth Pointer, Teri Bradford Rouse, Lorinda Dry and Sergio Hernandez</em></p> 
     <h5><strong>A New Face in the Alumni &amp; Parent Office</strong></h5> 
     <p><img src="images/LorindaDry_11.13.jpg" width="133" height="200" alt="Lorinda Dry">You might notice a new face in the photo above. I’m pleased to announce that Lorinda Dry ’81 has joined us as the new assistant director of alumni and parent programs. Lorinda (and her husband, Ed ’81) have been faithful Warriors over the years, volunteering as class agents, chapter leaders and reunion leaders and serving until May 2014 on our Parents Council. We had an opening, Lorinda and Ed were relocating to Santa Barbara, and as God would have it, the match was made!</p> 
     <p> Lorinda will direct activities for alumni such as Homecoming, reunions, and regional chapter events as well as programs for current parents. </p> 
     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
     <h5><strong>Local Alumni Celebrate Christmas with Santa</strong></h5> 
     <p><img src="images/PickleTreeLighting_Small.jpg" width="325" height="216" alt="Pickle Tree Lighting"> Every year Westmont hosts the annual Pickle Tree Lighting (the huge redwood on Kerrwood Circle) for students and alumni. This event kicks off the Christmas season with hot cocoa and cookies, the famous Pickle Tree Address delivered by a faculty member and the lighting of the tree!</p> 
     <p> In addition, alumni look forward to photos with Santa by the decorated tree inside Kerrwood Hall. We had 64 alumni families, 114 students and 20 faculty and staff participate in the photos! The evening culminates in a much-anticipated gourmet dinner for students in the festively decorated DC hosted by President Beebe and the entire executive team. </p> 
     <h5>Alumni Accolades:</h5> 
     <p> In this Christmas edition, we highlight Sean and Page Whiting, who have a heart for orphans in India. In a few short years, their ministry has thrived. Even in the midst of personal trials, they express their joy in all they do. This Christmas they are reaching out to many to help provide an abundant Christmas for their kids. Read the story—you’ll be inspired. </p> 
     <h6><a id="whiting"></a>Meet Sean and Paige Whiting (and Jaya!)</h6> 
     <p><img src="images/SeanandPaigeWhiting.jpg" width="250" height="166" alt="Sean and Paige Whiting">Sean '95 and Paige '00 were married in 2009 and left their jobs in education in 2011 to move to Andhra Pradesh in southeastern India to work with <em>Covenant Children's Homes. </em><strong>... </strong>Thisprogram places orphaned and abandoned children in a new model of global orphan care that involves the local church in caring for their own. Previously, 90 children lived in 10 different “church” children’s homes. Today, 545 children reside in 69 different village church homes.<strong></strong></p> 
     <p style="text-align:justify;">Sean and Paige work with indigenous believers to create an atmosphere of love and belonging. The pastor’s immediate family takes of local children in crisis on a day-to-day basis, and the entire church community nurtures them as they grow up. This approach gives the children a solid foundation emotionally, physically and spiritually. A child in a <em>Covenant Children’s Home</em> has moved from once-orphaned or -abandoned to:</p> 
     <p>· A church home with parents: a local pastor and his family<br> · A family-style living environment with four brothers or sisters<br> · A private education so they can <em>learn</em> their way out of poverty<br> · Daily discipleship and worship as they grow in their relationship with God.<br> · Likely being the last of their biological family to ever experience poverty.<br> </p> 
     <p>Parenthetically, these children have never received a gift. Sean and Paige are committed to reminding them of God's love this time of year by providing the gift of new clothes to bring dignity to a once-orphaned spirit. &nbsp;To learn more about their program and the Christmas gifts in India, visit their website: <a href="http://www.cch-india.com/">www.cch-india.com</a>.</p>

     <h5><a id="volunteer"></a>Get involved with your Alma Mater: <br> Seeking Chapter Leaders and Alumni Council Members </h5> 
     <p>I’m always so encouraged when alumni ask how they can serve Westmont either locally or from afar. As we think about 2014 and some new beginnings, I’m aware of the needs we have waiting for eager alumni to fill! The alumni office is seeking to add to our current <strong>Chapter Leader Team,</strong> and we have vacancies in the following areas:<strong> ... </strong>In California: San Gabriel Valley/ Los Angeles, Orange County, the Bay Area, the Central Valley ; Outside California: Washington, D.C., Minnesota . If you’re interested in knowing more, email me at <a href="mailto:tbradfordrouse@westmont.edu">tbradfordrouse@westmont.edu</a><u>,</u> and we will communicate with you in January when we have our updated volunteer job description available. </p> 
     <p>As our Westmont Alumni Advisory Council begins two new phases of work, Career Connections and Global Service Opportunities, we’re looking to add a few members who have expertise and passion in these areas. If you’re interested in hearing about the goals and responsibilities of being on the WAAC, email me at <a href="mailto:tbradfordrouse@wesmont.edu">tbradfordrouse@wesmont.edu</a>. </p> 
     <h5>Reunion Leaders for Homecoming 2014 </h5> 
     <p>If your class year ends in a 4 or 9, you will celebrate a milestone reunion at Homecoming 2014, October 17-19! If you want to see your classmates and connect anew, consider volunteering as a reunion leader. Alumni organize and shape reunions, so let us know if you’d be interested in planning or being involved with your reunion! You can email Lorinda at <a href="mailto:ldry@westmont.edu">ldry@westmont.edu</a>.</p> 
     <h5><a id="soccer"></a>Women’s Soccer: Winners on Many fronts</h5> 
     <p><img src="images/WomensSoccer_12.13.jpg" width="475" height="316" alt="Soccer"><span class="img_dont_wrap">The Westmont women’s soccer team won their semi-final round at the national championship with a nail-biting finish. The score was tied 2-2 after two overtimes, and Westmont won the penalty kick shootout 7-6 to earn a return to the championship game for the first time since 2003. The next day they played in the 2013 NAIA National Championship against No. 4 Concordia, who won the match by a score of 1-0. We’re extremely proud of our lady Warriors, who enjoyed such a successful season.</span></p> 
     <p><u><a href="http://blogs.westmont.edu/athletics/2013/12/01/nationals-second-round/">Women’s Soccer Honored as Champions of Character</a></u>: On the eve of the second-round games at the NAIA Women’s Soccer National Championship, the Westmont women’s soccer team received the <strong>NAIA Champions of Character Team Award</strong>. <strong>... </strong>Presented at the Final Site Banquet in Orange Beach, Ala., the annual award honors one team from each championship sport that exemplifies the NAIA Champions of Character five core values: integrity, respect, responsibility, sportsmanship and servant leadership.</p> 
     <h5><strong><a id="patterson"></a>The Sum of All Prayers: Or How to Pray for Westmont College</strong> </h5> 
     <h6><strong>Words from Campus Pastor Ben Patterson: </strong> </h6> 
     <p> <img src="images/ben-patterson.jpg" alt="Ben Patterson" width="135" height="135"><em>“This, then, is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'"</em></p> 
     <p>Thomas Aquinas believed everything we need to know is found in three things: the Apostles’ Creed, what to believe; the Ten Commandments, what to do; and the Lord’s Prayer, what to pray.</p> 
     <p><strong> ... </strong>The Lord’s Prayer is like a compass. It points to true north, and with that, east, west and south. In other words, when we are clear on God’s priorities, all other concerns find their proper place. The Lord’s Prayer washes and dresses and sanctifies our longings and desires and gives them their proper expression. And what it does for us it does for all the prayers of the Bible, implicit and explicit. All the truth of Holy Scripture can be hung on the pegs of its petitions. </p> 
     <p>Clearly Jesus meant for it to be repeated; not as meaningless repetitions (Matthew 6:7), but as meaningful repetitions to be whispered tenderly and often the way lovers speak to each other. Or it can be like a Christmas tree, on which we hang our own decorations, our own prayers. Or it can be like a map: the directions, the guidelines are there, but we must take the trouble to travel, to pray them (1). Each direction, each guideline says, “pray this way:” </p> 
     <p>So pray that: </p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>God’s name be hallowed at this college—revered, respected, held in awe and adored. The beginning of wisdom, after all, is the fear of the Lord (Psalms 11:10; Proverbs 1:7). </li> 
      <li>God’s kingdom come at Westmont, that he sovereignly bring about the glorious day when the Earth will be as full of the knowledge of God as the waters cover the sea (Isaiah 11:9), and every knee bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (Philippians 2:10-11). </li> 
      <li>With faculty, students and staff, his will be our food and drink as together we work and wait for his kingdom (John 4:34). </li> 
      <li>God give us what we need in the meantime: our bread, our necessaries, whatever we need to persevere (Matthew 6:19-34). </li> 
      <li>God forgive our sins. Isn’t it lovely that Jesus teaches us to wait before we talk to God about our sins—to speak first to God about God before we speak to God about us? Oh yes, and that we forgive each other as God forgives us! </li> 
      <li>We be protected from every test and evil as we struggle in this spiritual warfare for God’s rule on earth and in our community (Ephesians 6:10-20). </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>Pray this way for Westmont. The possibilities and variations are endless. </p> 
     <p><em>1</em><em> These wonderful metaphors come from Peter Kreeft, </em><em>Fundamentals of the Faith, </em><em>(San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1988), pp. 190-191</em> </p>
