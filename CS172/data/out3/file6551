On Martin Luther King&#x2019;s Birthday, <strong>Monday, January 21st, </strong>CCC will be partnering with the Honors Program at Rutgers-Camden and their Civic Scholars program in order to provide a day of service to non-profits in Camden.&nbsp; This is a great opportunity to serve the larger community, to learn about some area non-profits and to meet some honors students from Rutgers-Camden.&nbsp; If you are interested, please contact Jackie Tenuto to sign-up at <a href="mailto:jtenuto@camdencc.edu">jtenuto@camdencc.edu</a> &nbsp;Transportation will be provided.</p> <p>2. Speaking of the Honors Program at Rutgers-Camden.&nbsp; When I took a group of our students this past Wednesday to visit, their director told us that as of Fall, 2013, transfer students with certain GPA&#x2019;s will get an automatic Academic Achievement Award scholarship.&nbsp; Students with a 3.5-3.74 will get $1000, and students with a 3.75-4.0 will get $2000 (this is in addition to any NJStar money you might receive).&nbsp; So . . . not only will you be admitted to their Honors Program if you complete the requirements of our Honors Program, but you also will get some additional money to help pay for your studies.&nbsp; </p> <p>3.&nbsp; Here is another service opportunity over break, and it might be particularly interesting to those of you in math, science, computer science, etc.&nbsp; See the note below from Don Delaney about a <strong>January 5th</strong> Science Olympiad here at CCC.&nbsp; Please contact him ASAP if you might be able to help J Jennifer,</p> <p>I am looking for Volunteers for the Science Olympiad that we are hosting on January 5, 2013 from 9:30 a.m. &#x2013; 2:30 p.m.&nbsp; Can you please pass along to your honors program.<br> &nbsp;I need the following:<br> Escort teams to their homerooms <br> Test graders.</p> <p><strong>Donald Delaney</strong>, <strong>Director</strong><br> <strong>Outreach Programs &amp; Educational Services</strong><br> <strong>Ph: (856) 227-7200, ext. 4660</strong><br> <strong><a href="mailto:ddelaney@camdencc.edu">ddelaney@camdencc.edu</a></strong></p> <p>4. &nbsp;Another reminder that Phi Theta Kappa, the Honor Society of the Two Year College is having an information night this <strong>Wednesday, December 12th at 7:00 p.m.</strong> &#x2013; this is for both new and prospective members, and it is a great opportunity to hear more about the projects and scholarships that this organization can provide.&nbsp; I highly encourage all of you to join PTK!!!&nbsp; See message below for details:</p> <p>The officers of the <em>Alpha Nu Mu</em> Chapter at CCC will be holding an <strong>Orientation Session</strong>&nbsp;next week:</p> <p><strong>Wed.

Thursday, October 25th from 3:30-5:00 in the Honors Program Lounge, Connector Room 360, in Blackwood</u>, and <u>Tuesday, October 23rd from 4:00-5:15 in Room 412 College Hall in Camden</u> there will be transfer/scholarship workshops just for Honors Program students.&nbsp; If you are thinking about transferring for Fall, 2013, and you have not yet attended this workshop, it is very important that you try to come because <em>now</em> is when you should be sending out applications for next Fall.&nbsp; We will also have information about several scholarship and financial aid programs, which can help you better understand how to fund your future education.&nbsp; If you aren&#x2019;t graduating this Spring, you are still welcome to come so that you can understand how best to approach the transfer process.&nbsp; If you are at the Rohrer Campus and cannot attend this workshop, please send me an e-mail, and I would be happy to come meet with you individually.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s another event that might be of interest . . . .</p> <p><u>Cultural Event, Open Mic Night </u>:&nbsp; On <em>Tuesday, October 23rd from 6:30 </em>on, the CCC Literary Club will present the latest copy of its Literary Journal, the Madison Review, and hold an open mic night in <em>Civic Hall, Connector Building, Blackwood</em>. In the past year this event has seen readings by students, faculty and staff and even a recitation in Ancient Greek.&nbsp; Lots of fun, and all are welcome either to participate or just to be part of the audience!&nbsp; </p> <p>So, that&#x2019;s all for today.&nbsp; Feel free to ask if I can be useful with respect to advisement, transfer information, etc.&nbsp; The schedule for November events in the Honors Program Lounge will be coming soon.&nbsp; Have&nbsp; a great day!!! </p> <p align="center" class="style38"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[ <a href="#top">Top of Page</a> ]</font> </p> 
              <hr> <p><span class="style38"><strong><a name="oct8"></a>Honors Program Newsletter</strong><br></span><strong>October 8, 2012</strong></p> <p>Hello, Everyone!&nbsp; </p> <p>Some of you are so organized that I have already spoken to you about classes for Spring, 2013, and now is exactly the time to be thinking about such things.&nbsp; For all of you, please read all of the enclosed information carefully, and feel free to contact me with any questions.&nbsp; For those of you who are new to the College this semester, on October 22nd&nbsp;&nbsp; we will begin a week of &#x201c;priority registration&#x201d; for Spring, 2013 classes.&nbsp; <u>You definitely want to take advantage of this week because you can get the first choice of classes, and you can register during this one week only without having to make a payment until December 3rd</u>.&nbsp; Also, it helps us to be able to run the Honors sections since we know we have enough students; this fall we are running more classes than we ever have (9), and in the Spring we are offering 10.&nbsp; If you are willing to register during this priority period, it is the most beneficial for everyone.</p> <p>So, enclosed you will find a list of all of the courses that we are offering next semester through the Honors Program. As you can see, it is a pretty extensive set of classes, and it includes a course you have been requesting, an honors section of public speaking, SPE 102H!.&nbsp; Also, one of the general education requirements included in many of your degrees is a &#x201c;technology elective&#x201d;: the Information Literacy in a Digital Age (CSC 102H) would be a good way to satisfy that requirement, and it would give you lots of useful research tools for the remainder of your studies. Finally, a word about CHM 140H.&nbsp; This is a course designed for non-majors.&nbsp; It may seem odd to you to take an honors course in an area if it is not your strong suit, but think of all the science majors who take honors English courses (and do quite well) - everyone earning an AA degree is required to take a lab science, and I urge you to do so by signing up for Ying Mao&#x2019;s CHM 140H class.&nbsp; </p> <p>You can take as many Honors classes as you like, keeping in mind that you need to finish at least four total during your time at CCC in order to complete the Honors Program.&nbsp; In addition, the ENG 102H, ENG 271H, FLM 201H, HIS 101H, PHL 232H &amp; SOC 101H class are all repeats &#x201c;based on popular demand&#x201d; J</p> <p>I have included for each of you an individualized degree audit, which shows where any of these classes would fit into your degree programs.&nbsp; You are also welcome to take any of the other Honors Courses, if you are interested, but I want to be sure you understand that these classes would not be required for your program, although they would of course count toward your total of four Honors Courses.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next two weeks, October 8-19, are an advisement period before the priority registration week, October 22-October 28.&nbsp; <u>For all Honors Classes, you must request that a computer petition flag be tripped before you can register on line.&nbsp; So, if you are an NJSTAR student, the two NJSTAR advisors, Lillie Howard and Kerry Barbuto, can trip that computer flag.&nbsp; For all other Honors Program Students, you can ask me to trip that flag by calling (856) 227-7200, X4676 OR sending me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:jhoheisel@camdencc.edu">jhoheisel@camdencc.edu</a> and telling me which classes you would like to take.</u>&nbsp; I will then confirm that I have tripped the flag, and you will be able to register for the Honors classes along with any other courses during Priority Registration week.&nbsp; If you want to speak or meet with me about your program or the courses before you register, I would be <em>happy</em> to do so.&nbsp; Just give me a call or an e-mail, and we can make an appointment.</p> <p><em>Other Important Advisement, Scholarship and Transfer Opportunities:</em></p> <p><u>1. Thursday, October 25th from 3:30-5:00 in the Honors Program Lounge, Connector Room 360, in Blackwood</u>, and <u>Tuesday, October 23rd from 4:00-5:15 in Room 412 College Hall in Camden</u> there will be transfer/scholarship workshops just for Honors Program students.&nbsp; If you are thinking about transferring for Fall, 2013, and you have not yet attended this workshop, it is very important that you try to come because <em>now</em> is when you should be sending out applications for next Fall.&nbsp; We will also have information about several scholarship and financial aid programs, which can help you better understand how to fund your future education.&nbsp; If you aren&#x2019;t graduating this Spring, you are still welcome to come so that you can understand how best to approach the transfer process.&nbsp; If you are at the Rohrer Campus and cannot attend this workshop, please send me an e-mail, and I would be happy to come meet with you individually.</p> <p><u>2. Thursday, November 29th, &nbsp;from 9:00-2:00 in the Atrium of the Connector Building in Blackwood </u>there will be a large Transfer Fair with over 30 colleges and universities represented.&nbsp; This is a great time to speak personally with a representative of that institution, to make a connection with a person instead of just a computer, to get details about their academic programs, to find out about the application process, to hear of scholarship opportunities for transfer students, etc.&nbsp; No appointments necessary, just stop by the different tables.</p> <p><em>For Graduates in Spring, 2013</em>.&nbsp; Congratulations!!&nbsp; If I can be of any help to you as you are applying to four-year colleges and universities, feel free to contact me.&nbsp; As part of the process, you are required to complete a &#x201c;Application for Graduation&#x201d;, which is available on-line by following this set of links:&nbsp; camdencc.edu, &#x201c;student services&#x201d;, &#x201c;records and registration&#x201d;, &#x201c;e-forms&#x201d;, &#x201c;graduation forms&#x201d;, then click on both &#x201c;graduation application&#x201d; and &#x201c;graduation instructions&#x201d;.&nbsp; The deadline to submit the Grad Packet is April 1st, so you might want to pick one up in January, if not before, to be sure you have all your paperwork done by that deadline.</p> <p><em>For those of you new to CCC</em>.&nbsp; Welcome!&nbsp; In addition to the information above, there are books in the Honors Program Lounge and some resources in my office to help you learn about degree programs at different colleges and universities to which you might want to transfer.&nbsp; I would be happy to meet with you anytime to talk generally about your studies, and that is true for those of you who are undecided about a major as well.&nbsp; The earlier you start thinking about such things, the greater options you will have.&nbsp; We have had students transfer from CCC transfer to a wonderful range of senior institutions and in many different disciplines, so &#x201c;shoot for the moon&#x201d;.&nbsp; </p> <p><em>Again, a final plea that you register for your spring classes during Priority Registration.</em>&nbsp; It helps you to get the schedule you want, and it helps us to know which classes will carry or not.&nbsp; If you wait until later to register, the classes might be full or canceled, so please register during that week if at all possible.</p> <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed working with those of you who have called, e-mailed or stopped by.&nbsp; You are a great group, and it has been a pleasure to have you as part of this fifth year of CCC&#x2019;s Honors Program.&nbsp; Enjoy your classes this semester, and feel free to contact me anytime. </p> <p>Sincerely,<br> Jennifer R.

The idea behind this requirement is to encourage you to take advantage of some of the opportunities on campus beyond just the classroom.&nbsp; Even though we aren&#x2019;t a residential college, there are lots of lectures, clubs, events, most of which are paid for by your tuition, so we want you know about them J</p> <p>For those of you who are new to the college this semester, a quick reminder about the two &#x201c;Welcome Back BBQ&#x2019;s&#x201d; on <strong>Wednesday, September 19th</strong> <strong>in Camden and</strong> <strong>Wednesday, September 26th in Blackwood</strong> &#x2013; both will have lunch from 11-2:00 and tables representing different clubs.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s a good way to get an overview of some of the different activities on campus.&nbsp; Here is some more club news:</p> <p>1. WDBK is CCC&#x2019;s student radio station (91.5 FM); if you are interested in finding out more about how to get involved, contact station manager, Jamie Myerson at <a href="mailto:jmyerson@camdencc.edu">jmyerson@camdencc.edu</a></p> <p>2.

Enclosed is a brochure from the Center for Civic Leadership and Responsibility, and it has LOTS and LOTS of cultural opportunities that would count as one of your three required events.&nbsp; The events on pages 2-7 are all FREE, but you do need to fill out the registration form on page 7, because we keep track of the number of people who come to each event so that we can apply for grants to keep offering lectures, etc.&nbsp; Pages 8 &amp; 9 are paid events, and pages 10-15 are mini courses, which cost $25 for each 5 week session &#x2013; any of these would count as one of your three required events as well, and the mini courses actually appear on your transcript as audits.&nbsp; Of the free events, there are lectures and workshops on the Civil War, the Maya, the Constitution and the November Presidential Election, Bruce Springsteen, Arab Spring and Autism Spectrum Disorders . . . . so, a wide range of topics.&nbsp; I am going to highlight just two, because they are next week:&nbsp; On <strong>Wednesday, September 19th from 1:00-3:00</strong> in the Forum Room off of the Atrium of the Connector Building, Blackwood, there will be a talk about &#x201c;One Man, One Vote?&#x201d; &#x2013; see page 4 of the brochure for details.&nbsp; Then, on <strong>Thursday, September 20th at 7:00 p.m.</strong> in Civic Hall of the Connector Building, there will be a panel discussing the 2012 Presidential Election &#x2013; see page 5 of the brochure for details.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, these events are free, but you do need to register by following the directions on page 7 of the brochure.</p> <p>9.&nbsp; Lastly, please look at the enclosed letter all about our new lounge which opens Monday, September 17th.&nbsp; We will have a &#x201c;grand opening&#x201d; (i.e. &#x2013; coffee/cookie break) on <strong>Wednesday, October 10th from 1:00-3:00</strong>.&nbsp; The Lounge is Room 360 of the Connector Building, Blackwood.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s all for this first newsletter, but I hope you each found at least one thing that peaked your interest.&nbsp; I will send more opportunities throughout the semester as things arise.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I hope you are enjoying your classes.&nbsp; If I can be helpful in anyway, please feel free to contact me.&nbsp; My office hours this semester are:</p> <p>Jennifer Hoheisel<br> 314C Madison<br> Monday:&nbsp; 10:00-12:00<br> Tuesday:&nbsp; 11:00-12:00<br> Thursday:&nbsp; 11:00-12:00 &amp; 1:30-3:15<br> (856) 227-7200, X4676<br> <a href="mailto:jhoheisel@camdencc.edu">jhoheisel@camdencc.edu</a></p> <p>I am also happy to make appointments at either the Camden or Rohrer campuses if that is more convenient for you &#x2013; just send me an e-mail.</p> <p>Take care,<br> Jennifer Hoheisel&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p align="center" class="style38"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[ <a href="#top">Top of Page</a> ]</font> </p>

              <hr> <p><span class="style38"><strong><a name="march14"></a>Honors Program Newsletter</strong><br> <strong>March 14, 2012</strong></span></p> <p>Hello, Everyone!</p> <p>Even as you wind up this semester, it is time to begin thinking about Fall, 2012 classes.&nbsp; Enclosed you will find the list of nine Honors Program courses that we will be offering in Fall, 2012.&nbsp; We&#x2019;re very excited that this is the most extensive fall list we&#x2019;ve offered; it includes three night classes and one new class, PHL 131H, which will be offered at the Camden Campus on Tuesday nights. <strong><em>Priority Registration for fall classes is from April 9 &#x2013; April 15 this year, and the official &#x201c;advisement period&#x201d; runs from after spring break until April 6th. You absolutely should take advantage of this Priority Registration period because you will get the best choice of classes (new students can begin registering May 16th this year!), and if you do the Priority Registration, no payment is due until July 9th.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also helps us to be sure that classes will have enough enrollment to carry (this spring we didn&#x2019;t have to cancel any classes!).&nbsp; So, PLEASE register during priority registration if at all possible. </p> <p><em>Remember, that in order to register for these courses, you need to either meet with me or contact me to ask me to trip the computer flag that allows you to register.&nbsp; Since these sections are only open to Honors Program students, you can&#x2019;t sign up for them on webadvisor until I trip that flag &#x2013; after I do so, you can register for them along with all of your other classes.&nbsp; If possible, I would like to hear from you before priority registration begins, so that I can get it set up for you.&nbsp; </em></p> <p><em>If you are an NJSTAR student, Lillie Howard and Marie Cifelli are still your advisors, and they can also trip the computer flags that allow you to register for the Honors Courses, so just contact them to set up an advisement appointment before Priority Registration starts.</em></p> <p>In addition to the list of the fall courses, I have enclosed a copy of your own &#x201c;degree audit&#x201d;.&nbsp; This shows the major you are currently listed as pursuing, the courses you have completed, the courses you are taking now, and what you have left to complete the degree.&nbsp; On that audit, I have highlighted any of the courses you still need, which are being offered as honors sections this fall. So, you know where the courses you might take in the Honors Program would fit in with your degree, and you can certainly take more than one Honors course if you like!! If you are pursuing a different degree than what is listed on the audit, you need to officially change your curriculum with the office of records and registration; also, let me know, and I can run a new audit with the correct major.</p> <p>In Spring, 2013, we will definitely be teaching Honors Sections of ENG 271 (the world literature course required for students transferring to Rutgers) and PHL 232 (Biomedical Ethics).&nbsp; We also will probably repeat SOC 101H, HIS 101H, FLM 201H &amp; CSC 102H.&nbsp; If you would like to speak with me or meet with me in person about any of the classes, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:jhoheisel@camdencc.edu">jhoheisel@camdencc.edu</a> or (856) 227-7200, X4676.&nbsp; I hope this helps you to find Honors classes that fit into your schedule.&nbsp; </p> <p>Meanwhile, here are a couple more events/projects in which you might like to participate:</p> <p><em>Academic Event:&nbsp; Math Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta.&nbsp; </em>Starting after Spring Break, if you are interested in joining the math honor society, Mu Alpha Theta, you should send an e-mail including your student ID to the faculty advisor, Penny Luczak.&nbsp; You need to have a GPA of 3.5 or higher in all of your math classes and to have completed at least MTH 120 or above.&nbsp; Dues to join are $10, and the induction ceremony will be on May 8th.&nbsp; So, if you qualify and are interested, please contact Faculty Advisor, Penny Luczak at <a href="mailto:pluczak@camdencc.edu">pluczak@camdencc.edu</a> or X4674 as soon as you return next week so that she can send all qualified applicants an official invitation at the end of the month.</p> <p><em>Service Event:&nbsp; Suit Collection.</em>&nbsp; Between <strong>March 19th and April 6th</strong>, the College will once again participate in a &#x201c;Suit Youself&#x201d; drive to collect suits donated to help students who will be interviewing for jobs.&nbsp; On <strong>April 12th &amp; 13th</strong>, students will be able to come in to &#x201c;shop&#x201d; and Jackie Tenuto in Student Activities will need help sorting and doing inventory.&nbsp; If you would like to donate a suit, please drop it off between March 19th and April 6th in room 200 of the Community Center in Blackwood.&nbsp; If you would like to help with distribution on the 12th or 13th, please contact Jackie Tenuto at <a href="mailto:jtenuto@camdencc.edu">jtenuto@camdencc.edu</a>&nbsp; </p> <p><em>Academic Event:&nbsp; Poetry.&nbsp; </em><strong>On Tuesday, April 3rd, starting at 7:00 with refreshments, there will be an event called &#x201c;Literature Live&#x201d; in Civic Hall, Madison, Blackwood.&nbsp; </strong>Students, faculty and administrators will read favorite poems as well as original poems and fiction, including some readings from other cultures.&nbsp; Any questions, contact Professor O&#x2019;Shaughnessy at X4561.</p> <p>So, again, please contact me with any questions, and hope to see you soon for one or more of these events!&nbsp; Meanwhile, I will see some of you at the Honors Program Orientation on March 22nd J </p> <p>Jennifer Hoheisel, <br> Professor of Philosophy &amp;<br> Honors Program Director<br> <a href="mailto:jhoheisel@camdencc.edu">jhoheisel@camdencc.edu</a><br> (856) 227-7200, X4676 </p> <p align="center" class="style38"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[ <a href="#top">Top of Page</a> ]</font></p> 
              <hr> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span class="style38"><strong><a name="jan24" id="march8"></a>Honors Program Newsletter</strong><br> <strong>January 24, 2012</strong></span></p> <p class="style38">Welcome back, Everyone!</p> <p class="style38">I hope that your breaks were productive, relaxing, profitable or contained at least a little bit of whatever would help you recharge your intellectual batteries.&nbsp; Now that this semester is underway, I wanted to make you aware of a number of service/cultural/academic opportunities.&nbsp; As you know, each of you is required to do three such events sometime during your studies here at CCC in order to be considered as having completed the requirements of the Honors Program (this is in addition to taking four honors courses total and maintaining an overall GPA of 3.5 or higher).&nbsp; Hopefully this requirement isn&#x2019;t just a &#x201c;checking of the box&#x201d;, but rather gives you the chance to learn, volunteer and/or socialize outside the classroom.&nbsp; It might help you get a bit more out of your experience here, and it lets you present a more interesting profile as you apply to transfer to four year schools. &nbsp;So, with that background, please read the following choices carefully &#x2013; there really is something for everyone J</p> <p class="style38">1. <em>Academic Opportunities &#x2013; History, Religion, Autism/Education, Philosophy, Literature, Marine Biology, Food, &amp; World Geography</em>.&nbsp; Enclosed find this semester&#x2019;s brochure of offerings from the Center for Civic Leadership and Responsibility.&nbsp; Pages 2-8 list free lectures, and you can go to just one if you like; you don&#x2019;t need to attend all the lectures if they are in a series &#x2013; for example, if you want to go to one of the Eisenhower lectures, that would count.&nbsp; However, for any of them, you need to register by filling out page 9 and turning it in to the CCLR office, which is currently in Room 101 of the Community Center in Blackwood.&nbsp; If you are at the Camden or Cherry Hill campuses, you can mail the registration in to the address at the top of the form.&nbsp; For pages 10-14 of the brochure, these are mini-courses which cost $25 per set of five sessions.&nbsp; One of our Honors Program professors, Josh Roberson is teaching one on Religion, Magic and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt.&nbsp; If you wish to take any of the mini-courses, you need to complete the registration form on page 15 of the brochure.&nbsp; You can audit the course, instead of taking it for a grade, and it will appear on your transcript.&nbsp; So . . . lots of choices just within this brochure &#x2013; if you have any questions, let me know.</p> <p class="style38">2. <em>Cultural Opportunity &#x2013; Writing</em>.&nbsp; On Thursday, February 9th at 7:30 (refreshments at 7:00) in Civic Hall of the Blackwood Campus, novelist Lauren Davis will be speaking as part of the Dead Poet Society&#x2019;s Visiting Author Series.&nbsp; If you have any questions, contact Keith O&#x2019;Shaughnessy at <a href="mailto:koshaughnessy@camdencc.edu">koshaughnessy@camdencc.edu</a> or X4561.</p> <p class="style38">3. <em>Service Opportunity &#x2013; Chemistry Tutor</em>.&nbsp; Professor Susan Choi received an e-mail from a family interested in finding a tutor for their daughter who is struggling in 10th grade honors chemistry.&nbsp; If you might be interested, please e-mail the family directly at jdscg@yahoo.com&nbsp; - the parent&#x2019;s name is Jada Goodman.</p> <p class="style38">4. <em>Cultural Opportunity &#x2013; Theater</em>.&nbsp; <strong>On March 2,3,4, 8,9 &amp;10</strong> CCC&#x2019;s Stages will be presenting <u>The 39 Steps</u> on the Blackwood campus.&nbsp; This play has 4 cast members playing 150 roles &#x2013; my husband and son saw it at the Walnut Theatre in Philadelphia and LOVED it.&nbsp; So, if you want an extremely entertaining diversion, support the CCC theater students and consider going to one of their performances.&nbsp;&nbsp; For ticket and performance information, go to <a href="http://www.stagesccc.com/">www.stagesccc.com</a> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, on <strong>May 4, 5, 6, 11 &amp; 12</strong>, Stages will be presenting Our Town, which has been described as &#x201c;the greatest American play ever written.&#x201d;&nbsp; It is an &#x201c;unforgettable exploration of the mystery, joy and fleeting nature of life.&#x201d;&nbsp; Information about these performances can also be found at <a href="http://www.stagesccc.com/">www.stagesccc.com</a> </p> <p class="style38">Also, in a couple of weeks, I will be sending two e-mail surveys:&nbsp; one to see which Honors Program course you would like to see offered at the <strong><u>Camden Campus</u></strong> in Fall, 2012 and a second survey to see what type of cultural trip you would prefer for this spring &#x2013; we have some money available, and I want to know if you would like to go to a play, a musical performance, a film, etc.&nbsp; Please watch for those surveys J</p> <p class="style38">In addition to all of this information, if I can help in any way with the transfer or scholarship applications I mentioned in my last e-mail, please feel free to contact me.&nbsp; My office hours this semester are:</p> <p class="style38">Madison 314C, Blackwood (I am happy to come meet you at another campus if we make an appointment)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
