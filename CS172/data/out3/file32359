              <p class="date"><span class="date-display-single">February 27, 2015</span></p> 
              <img class="image-scaled-3x2-648x432" src="http://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/styles/image_scaled_3x2_648x432/public/Bell.Bobby__0.jpg?itok=NM0thJDU" width="648" height="432" alt="Bobby Bell sits in front of a microphone." title="Bobby Bell"> 
              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>When Bobby Bell crosses the Mariucci Arena stage to collect his bachelor’s degree in May, the 74-year-old former Gopher football star will complete an unlikely dream and fulfill a promise he made in 1958.</p>
               <p>Growing up in Shelby, North Carolina, Bell lived a childhood of segregated schools and businesses and limited opportunity, including for sports. He chose to pursue a recreation, park, and leisure studies major because of the difference a few dedicated men made in his life, building the first parks and pool for African Americans in Shelby and teaching him to play team sports.</p>
               <p>Encouraged by his father, Bell set his sights on college. Football provided the opportunity when Minnesota’s Murray Warmath—one of the few major-college coaches then recruiting black players—offered him a scholarship. As he stepped onto an airplane for the first time, Bell promised his father he would not quit. “It wasn’t just for me,” Bell says. “It was for him, for my mom, my family, all the Blacks in Shelby.”</p>
               <p>Bell helped the Gophers win national title in 1960 and the Rose Bowl in 1962. He finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting that year, an astonishing feat for a defensive player. Following a Hall of Fame career with the Kansas City Chiefs, he worked for General Motors and opened a string of restaurants.</p>
               <p>In a lifetime of “you can do it” moments, earning his degree is right up there, Bell says. “Can you imagine all this coming from where I did?” he says. “Minnesota gave me the opportunity to have all this happen.”</p>

               <p>Although teen drivers make up a small percentage of the U.S. driving population, they are at an especially high risk of being involved in a crash.</p>
               <p>To help keep teen drivers safe on the road, researchers at the U of M’s HumanFIRST Laboratory have been refining the Teen Driver Support System (TDSS).</p>
               <p>The smartphone-based TDSS device, mounted on the vehicle's dashboard, provides visual and auditory warnings to the teen driver about speeding, stop sign violations, excessive maneuvers, upcoming curves, unauthorized passengers, and seat belt use. It also prevents teens from using their phones to text or call (except 911) while driving. If an infraction continues after the TDSS warning, a text message is sent to parents. Information is also available to parents on a website that summarizes their teen's driving events and behaviors over time.</p>
               <p>A usability study of the system completed in 2011 found that teens and parents held favorable opinions about most of the TDSS functions. They also believed that using the system after obtaining a license may result in teens adopting safer driving habits that remain even after the system is no longer in use.</p>
               <p>The University is exploring options for commercialization of the TDSS.</p>

              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>There’s another trophy bound for Ridder Arena.</p>
               <p>The No. 2-ranked Golden Gopher women's hockey team clinched its third straight WCHA regular-season title and ninth overall with a 2-0 win and series sweep over No. 6 Minnesota Duluth at Ridder Arena Feb. 14.</p>
               <p>The win upped Minnesota’s record to 20-2-4 in the WCHA (27-2-4 overall) with one weekend remaining in the conference season. Second-place Wisconsin trails the Gophers by eight points in standings.</p>
               <p>"I'm proud of our four seniors," said head coach Brad Frost after the game. "It's another banner for them and this team. It's a pretty exciting way to end the weekend."</p>
               <p>The Gophers hope to add to their total of four national championships. They won back-to-back titles in 2011-12 and 2012-13 (with a perfect record of 41-0), and narrowly missed claiming a three-peat last year when they lost in the NCAA final to Clarkson.</p>
               <p><i>In other recent Gopher Sports news, Amanda Zahui B. scored a career-high 39 points and grabbed a Big Ten–record 29 rebounds as the women’s basketball team upset No. 13 Iowa 93-80 at Williams Arena, Feb. 18.</i></p>

               <p>The common plastic bag, notorious for choking sea birds and littering the environment, may soon give way to a new green material.</p>
               <p>A rubbery, biodegradable polyester, made from glucose and invented by U of M researchers Kechun Zhang, Frank Bates, and Marc Hillmyer, is the first economically viable product of its kind. It could replace petroleum-based plastics, rubber, and other materials that persist in, and damage, the environment. The new materials could also be used for arterial stents, chewing gum, and films laid over agricultural fields to protect them from freezing, Zhang says.</p>
               <p>The researchers genetically engineered bacteria to make enzymes that turn glucose into the building block of the polyester; a remarkably efficient 40 percent of the glucose was converted. And unlike the case with some proposed renewable energy sources, glucose can be obtained without clearing more land for farms, and production of the polyester can be easily scaled up.</p>
               <p>“Glucose is abundant, and [using it] doesn’t generate pressure on the environment,” Zhang says. “We make it possible to create environmentally friendly products without raising the cost. It’s sustainable and green.” The researchers are working to commercialize the technology.</p>

              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>University of Minnesota researcher Aaron Doering has traveled to the frigid reaches of northern Norway to visit nearly deserted fishing towns. He's also been to the bright, hot deserts of water-starved Burkina Faso. The locations are vastly different, but residents say the same thing: the changing climate is transforming their lives.</p>
               <p>For more than a decade, Doering has traveled around the world to share stories about the environment. Soon, he and his team will wrap up their most ambitious project yet: Earthducation, a four-year odyssey in which they traveled to "climate hotspots" on all seven continents to learn about the impact of global warming on an individual scale—and share those results with children and adults alike.</p>
               <p>To date, millions of people—including students in more than 5,000 classrooms, all 50 states, and six continents—have tuned in to watch Doering and his team travel the world.<br><br>Chris Ripken, a teacher at Centennial High School in Circle Pines, Minnesota, says the 9th-graders in his human geography course have responded so positively to Earthducation that he's used the program's lessons every year since it began.</p>
               <p>Doering says the trips were both fascinating and exhausting, but he's not done yet. Later in 2015, he'll begin another adventure around the globe.</p>
               <p>These explorations are invaluable, he says. "They're giving us insight into how the world is—and will be—changing."</p>

              <h3>Hibernation Holds Secrets for Our Health</h3> 
              <p class="date"><span class="date-display-single">February 12, 2015</span></p> 
              <img class="image-scaled-3x2-648x432" src="http://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/styles/image_scaled_3x2_648x432/public/7VVDYDRxemRPOx1.jpeg?itok=_2HsqQy9" width="648" height="432" alt="A researcher holds a baby black bear"> 
              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>As days shorten and winter sets in, University of Minnesota professor Paul Iaizzo makes the first of his annual treks to northern Minnesota to visit black bears in their dens. Iaizzo and his team are seeking to understand not just the mysteries of hibernation, but also how that knowledge could help humans.</p>
               <p>Consider the implications: a sedentary lifestyle in humans can be detrimental to our health, but hibernating bears—despite lying virtually motionless for at least five months every winter—emerge from their dens healthy in the spring.</p>
               <p>Working through his renowned Visible Heart Lab in partnership with Medtronic and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Iaizzo has already learned a lot about hibernation.</p>
               <p>The research may one day lead to new treatments for blood clots, heart failure, obesity, osteoporosis, and atrophied muscles.</p>
               <p>"Our biggest hope," says Iaizzo, "is that we'll be able to use components of hibernation induction triggers in human patients to enhance the viability of the affected tissues or, even better, preserve organs for transplant surgery."</p>
               <p>And so, while bears hibernate, great researchers never rest.</p>

               <p>Tom Staggs, the chair of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts and a graduate of the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, has been named the chief operating officer of The Walt Disney Company.<br><br>It’s only fitting that the No. 2 executive for the entertainment giant started off in the performance world himself. Staggs was a member of two bands and two ensembles at Minnetonka High School, and began as a music major at the U of M before switching to business. He earned a BS from the Carlson School in 1982, then got an MBA at Stanford.<br>&nbsp;<br>Staggs worked in investment banking at Dain Bosworth and Morgan Stanley before joining Disney in 1990 as manager of strategic planning. He was only 37 when then-CEO Michael Eisner named him CFO. He’ll continue to lead Disney’s Parks and Resorts division until a successor is named.<br><br>“It’s a privilege to step into this role, and I am humbled and honored by the opportunity,” Staggs said in a news release. <br><br>Humility was one of the themes in the commencement address Staggs delivered to Carlson School graduates this past spring. <br><br>“One of the dangerous things about success is that it can kill your interest in introspection,” he said to the class of 2014. “It takes confidence to admit that you don’t have all the right answers. … Humility is just as important to long-term success as self-confidence.”</p>

              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>As her final semester gets underway, it’s surreal for Baza Haile-Selassie to think that she nearly overlooked the U of M&nbsp;Carlson&nbsp;School of Business.</p>
               <p>Raised in a suburb of Minneapolis, Haile-Selassie took on leadership roles from an early age. She played sports, joined the theater club, served on the student government, and was an ambassador for international issues in her community. But despite her love for home, she pictured herself going to a college outside the state and started exploring her options beyond the University of Minnesota.</p>
               <p>Ultimately, it was the small-town feel of the community and its proximity to leading corporations that convinced her that Carlson was a standout.</p>
               <p>“There are so many opportunities for mentorships and internships in the Twin Cities,” she says. “There are a lot of other great business schools across the country, but they’re in the middle of nowhere. You don’t get businesspeople visiting your classes like we do here.”</p>
               <p>There are also boundless opportunities for international experiences, and with Haile-Selassie’s desire for exploration undiminished, she embarked on a life-changing international experience last fall. In addition to studying in London and travelling throughout Europe, she worked on the business development and marketing team at global engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff in London.</p>
               <p>As she looks forward to graduation, she’s excited to start her career after being recruited by a locally headquartered international corporation.</p>

               <p>Minnesota Student Association president Joelle Stangler ’16 accompanied Senator Al Franken to this year’s State of the Union Address, in Washington, D.C.</p>
               <h3>Q&amp;A with Joelle Stangler</h3>
               <p>Hometown: Rogers, Minnesota</p>
               <h4>Has this experience shaped your career goal?</h4>
               <p>Yes, it has. It confirmed that I'd like to serve the state of Minnesota in D.C. one day. Before the State of the Union Address, I got the opportunity to talk to Senator Mikulski (D-Maryland), who is the longest serving female senator. I told her I'm interested in holding a Senate seat one day, and she gave me great advice about the best way to achieve that goal. Everything from the experience as a whole and the independent interactions I had with individuals currently serving has shaped my perspective on what it might take to get there.</p>
               <h4>What’s one cause you’d serve as senator?</h4>
               <p>I'm really interested in returning the control in politics to voters, rather than special interests. Whether that's through increasing transparency, working to reduce gridlock, or pushing through campaign finance reform.</p>
               <h4>Why that cause?&nbsp;</h4>
               <p>As a student, I've felt the impact of not being taken as seriously in the legislative process because my demographic (a) doesn't vote, but more importantly (b) doesn't have the money to be a threat.</p>
               <h4>What proposal of President Obama did you find most important for Minnesota?</h4>
               <p>The conversation about free community college—because it pushes us to think of education beyond high school as a <i>public good</i>. It reinforces the need for continued attention on college affordability and the benefit of solutions like debt forgiveness and holding tuition flat.</p>

               <p>Without research, we’d have no vaccines, no smart phones … nor anything for universities to teach. A new report card from the Center for Measuring University Performance, at Arizona State University, ranks the U of M’s research enterprise among the top 25 for public universities; however, we were one of only nine that met all the CMUP criteria, including total and federally sponsored research, faculty awards, and doctorates earned.</p>
               <p>Other bright spots, from the U of M's <a href="http://research.umn.edu/">Office of the Vice President for Research</a>:</p>
               <p>• In FY2013 the U of M ranked ninth in research expenditures among public universities.</p>
               <p>• Since 2008, U of M patent filings have risen by 165 percent (from 52 to 138), new licenses by 144 percent, and startups based on U of M research from 2 to 15. One particularly productive researcher: Jian-Ping Wang (electrical and computer engineering), whose work spawned 39 patents and three startup companies.</p>
               <p>• Between fiscal years 2013 and 2014, R&amp;D budgets for key federal agencies rose 1.1 percent, while the U of M’s share of this funding rose by 2.4 percent.</p>
               <p>• A big growth area was research support via collaborations with other universities who, in essence, invested in the U of M.</p>
               <p>The upticks are no accident; among other measures, the U of M has cut red tape for researchers in business and industry who want to work with University colleagues.</p>

                <p>From a single ancient grain, we're harvesting new ways to feed the world.</p>
                <p>For thousands of years, wild cereal grains helped feed the Middle East in the face of drought and disease. Today, the University of Minnesota is collecting the last remaining samples of those ancient grains to help feed the world. By analyzing their genetic traits, we're breeding stronger, more productive wheat. Ultimately, we're growing hope of a safe, sustainable food supply for the world's growing population. It's one more way the future is being Made in Minnesota.</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>By 2030, one billion extra tons of grain will be needed to feed the growing population.</li>
                 <li>842 million people are currently undernourished worldwide.</li>
                 <li>20% of human calories come from wheat.</li>
                 <li>98% of the world's hungry live in developing countries.</li>

              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>Last year (2014) brought many triumphs in the realm of medical research at the U of M. Here are five of the outstanding discoveries:</p>
               <ul>
                <li>AIDS patients who started HIV treatment 46 weeks after being diagnosed with Cryptococcal meningitis—an AIDS-related fungal infection—had a 15 percent better survival rate than those who started the treatment 12 weeks after the diagnosis.</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                <li>A clinical trial offered hope that the quality of life can be improved for patients with a painful blistering condition known as epidermolysis bullosa.</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                <li>Children with chronic pancreatitis can enjoy pain relief and improved quality of life if the pancreas is removed and its hormone-secreting islet cells transplanted back.</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                <li>Negative emotions are linked to a higher risk of strokes and transient ischemic attacks (“mini-strokes”) in middle-aged and older adults.</li>
               </ul>
               <ul>
                <li>Some cardiac stem cells believed to give rise to heart cells do so too slowly to replace heart muscle, but they have helped grow blood vessels.&nbsp;</li>

              <h3>Breast Cancer Patient Helps Make Medical History in Minnesota</h3> 
              <p class="date"><span class="date-display-single">January 12, 2015</span></p> 
              <img class="image-scaled-3x2-648x432" src="http://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/styles/image_scaled_3x2_648x432/public/breast-cancer-patient.jpg?itok=9vhL6pGx" width="648" height="432" alt="Woman with butterflies."> 
              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>In 2014 Bonnie Harris was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. After surgery to remove pre-cancerous tissue, she became one of the first patients in the state to be treated with the Varian TruBeam® machine, a new technology at the U of M that delivers precisely targeted radiation to cancerous areas. The technology allowed only Harris’s breast cancer to receive radiation, while protecting vital organs like her heart and lungs from unnecessary exposure.</p>
               <p>In this therapy, a hole is cut in a radiation-blocking plate, in a shape and size that matches the target area. The plate is placed in the path of the radiation beam, which self-adjusts so that all the radiation is delivered through the hole, straight to the cancerous area and not to neighboring tissues and organs. Besides sparing healthy tissue, the treatments take considerably less time than conventional radiation therapy—a strong plus for Harris, who underwent daily treatments for six weeks. In September she celebrated the end of her treatment with a tradition in the radiation therapy center: She rang a ceremonial bell.</p>
               <p>The University is among the first places in Minnesota to offer the technology, which exemplifies how cancer treatment is moving toward precise and individualized treatments for patients.&nbsp;</p>

               <p>Many artists and other creative people bear a certain genetic similarity, not only to one another, but to those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Evidence suggests that “schizophrenia, like bipolar disorder, is a secondary consequence of genes that also produce positive human traits," says psychology graduate student Rachael Grazioplene. She also notes that healthy siblings of people with those disorders are particularly likely to have jobs involving creativity.</p>
               <p>Successful creative people and those with the disorders also share similarities in the patterns of connections between cells in specific areas of the brain. Most strikingly, though, the two groups express a personality trait known as "openness to experience," which describes the general tendency to be imaginative, curious and intellectual. Besides having an active fantasy life, people with this trait tend to see meaningful connections between unrelated details that others cannot see.</p>
               <p>Beyond all the similarities, however, must lie differences that allow certain people to inherit traits that lead them to excel in the imaginative realm and escape the burden of mental illness. These differences and the neural mechanisms underlying them interest Grazioplene the most, because understanding them is key to understanding and treating the illnesses.</p>

               <p>The University of Minnesota’s nationally accredited <a href="http://cce.umn.edu/college-in-the-schools">College in the Schools</a> brings U of M faculty together with local teachers to offer research-based courses in high schools throughout Minnesota. Here’s a taste of what’s being done.</p>
               <h4>Reasoning from experience</h4>
               <p>Margaret Kelly’s Sociological Perspectives: A Multicultural America teaches students to engage in high-level thinking. The course reinforces learning by bringing in students’ lived experiences with race and class into the assignments and discussions.</p>
               <h4>Mastering math with modeling</h4>
               <p>Sue Staats’s College Algebra through Modeling serves 600 students in 29 Minnesota schools. The course helps teachers make solid mathematics education accessible and helps students see themselves as college students.</p>
               <h4>Doing real science</h4>
               <p>Leon Hsu’s Physics by Inquiry is a lab-based course that fosters conceptual reasoning, so students can understand how science works by performing experiments, making explanatory models, and testing them.</p>
               <h4>Finding rigor through creativity</h4>
               <p>Murray Jensen’s Human Anatomy and Physiology lets teachers bring students the rigor of college science education. The course emphasizes creative thinking by engaging students in a wide range of learning tasks, cooperative quizzes, and discussions.</p>

              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>In recent years, it’s been shown that when many bacteria invade our bodies, they have a way of sensing when their numbers are great enough to resist our immune system’s defenses. This “quorum sensing” works through a molecular signal; when received, it gives bacteria the go-ahead to launch an all-out infection.</p>
               <p>Quorum sensing is used by infectious bacteria like <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, which causes pneumonia. Once the signal goes out that a quorum has been reached, the bacteria release virulence factors that help them attack, and become established in, lung cells. But Mikael Elias, an assistant professor of biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysics, and his colleagues have identified a substance that acts as the signal. They’ve discovered that shutting off production of the substance—a molecule called a lactone—gives rats protection from pneumonia, even when the numbers of bacteria remain high. Because this treatment doesn’t kill the bacteria, they may feel less selection pressure to develop resistance, says Elias. He adds that the technique holds promise as a preventive measure for cystic fibrosis patients, who are prone to infection by the bacteria, and in hospitals, where <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is an opportunistic pathogen. The research was published in the journal <i>PLoS One</i>.</p>

               <p>With air pollution linked to 100,000 deaths in the United States every year, the question of which fuels or power sources can best reduce the output of harmful pollution from vehicles becomes paramount. To get an accurate picture, harmful emissions of particulate matter and ground-level ozone during the entire life cycle of each fuel must be accounted for, as well as whether emissions occur near to or far from population centers.</p>
               <p>A new U of M study does that, comparing the air quality impacts on human health of 11 types of passenger cars, ranging from conventional gasoline and gasoline/electric hybrids to vehicles powered by electricity based on coal or either wind, water or solar (WWS) energy.&nbsp; The researchers found that electric vehicles powered by low-emitting electricity from natural gas or WWS energy could reduce environmental health impacts by 50 percent or more. But those powered with corn ethanol or coal-based “grid average” electricity increased those effects by even greater amounts. The researchers stress that their work shows the importance of looking at the full “life cycle” effects of each technology, not just tailpipe emissions. The study is published in the Dec. 15, 2014 <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>.</p>

               <p>Students in Ron Ott’s graphic design class Design and Its Discontents recorded everything they consumed for 30 days, blogged about the experience, and designed a response. Their projects range from a tree with branches of recycled electronics to a fingerprint composed of brand logos.</p>
               <p>Francesa Pancorbo designed a series to illustrate the parallel between negative treatment of women in advertising and headlines in the daily news.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey Anderson “wanted to experiment a bit.” He created a light fixture out of plastic Target bags.</p>

              <h3>Treating Diabetes with Beneficial Bacteria</h3> 
              <p class="date"><span class="date-display-single">November 18, 2014</span></p> 
              <img class="image-scaled-3x2-648x432" src="http://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/styles/image_scaled_3x2_648x432/public/treating-diabetes-with-bacteria.jpg?itok=AgrDMvXT" width="648" height="432" alt="Bacteria in a petri dish. "> 
              <div class="article-content"> 
               <p>The bacteria that live in our guts help us digest food, but their roles in keeping our bodies functioning go far beyond that. For example, U of M researchers Alexander Khoruts and Michael Sadowsky have shown that a healthy, well-fed, and diverse assortment of gut microbiota offers protection against serious conditions like <i>C. difficile </i>infections. Now the researchers are launching a clinical study to learn whether increasing the diversity of our live-in bacteria can help people with type 2 diabetes.</p>
               <p>In this form of diabetes, cells lose their sensitivity to insulin, and blood glucose levels rise. These patients also tend to have less diverse assortments of gut bacteria. The microbiota can be disrupted by factors like antibiotic use, which may kill off “good” bacteria; and a high-sugar, low-roughage diet, which can starve gut bacteria and may cause them to signal the brain to eat more, setting up a vicious cycle of overeating that raises the risk of diabetes.</p>
               <p>In the study, persons with pre-diabetes will receive transplants of fecal bacteria from either themselves or donors with good blood sugar and microbial diversity. If results indicate the donated microbiota helped increase insulin sensitivity, they may point the way to new therapies involving brain-bacteria communication.</p>
