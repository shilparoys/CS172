               Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.), an Assistant Director of the Department of Education in undivided Bengal and Assam, a renowned academician and social reformer, a reputed philanthropist, a famed literary figure and Sufi thinker of the country, was the pride of the Muslims in Bengal and one of the most enlightened personalities of his time. He was blessed with a long life and spent all his years for the advancement of a largely backward Muslims in the British-governed India by rejuvenating their thoughts and values and by lifting them from an all-consuming process of social degeneration. The goal of bringing a positive change both in the lives and the psyche of the Muslims that he had set himself to was fully accomplished through his works and deeds. As a result, Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) became an institution by himself. The name of this vast, prodigious personality, who lived long enough to drench him in the sunlight to an entire millennium, will be pronounced again and again generations after generations. This nation and its people will continue to be indebted to him many ways.

At this time, Director Martin recommended the names of 12 officials to the Government of Bengal for being absorbed from the Subordinate Education Service. The name of Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) was also among them and he was considered eligible by the Director. As a result, he became the first person to be absorbed from the inspecting line to the teaching line in the Provincial Service and was, consequently, appointed the Head Master of Rajshahi Collegiate School in 1904. During his working tenure there, he created a congenial atmosphere for the education of Muslim Students and removed the age-old hurdles that impaired their growth.

The classes of the madrasah were held in a number of rooms of the college where light was very insufficient. Through acquisition of a vast area of land, Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) made provisions for the madrasha. In Rajshahi, during those days, no Muslim was found contesting for the post of Chairman of the District Board. It was through his initiative that Mohammed Emazuddin was elected the Chairman of the District Board for the very first time.

H Sharp was always confident about the competence, honesty and professional integrity of Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.). So, he was never miserly in sanctioning the financial budgets proposed by Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) for the development of education in the Chittagong Division. Being sanctioned enough money, he could take many positive steps for the qualitative and quantitative improvements of many impoverished sub-divisional schools in the region. His personal contribution in establishing and running the high schools in Feni, Chandpur, Brahmanbaria, Chittagong and Noakhali was enormous. The huge school in Sheoratoli near Chittagong City was built at his initiative. Besides, in many areas of the Chittagong division, he built a number of hostels both for the Hindu and the Muslim students. He also built many schools in the abandoned houses of the Zamindars or Landlords, in the month of June 1911; he was elected a Member of the Royal Society (MRSA) of London.

And after his retirement, the post was filled by a British by the name of Mr. Botmali as no Indian after him was considered eligible for the post. In those days, two Assistant Directors were appointed to help the Director. But both had the same official status and remuneration ceilings. When the Division of Bengal was called off, the post of the Assistant Director was transferred to Calcutta. So, Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) also moved to Calcutta. For some time, he even held the current charge of the Director of the Department of Education in undivided Bengal. In 1929, at the age of 55, he retired from the government service. It also needs mentioning that he accomplished the Holy Hajj in 1920.

               The entire service life of Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) was spent in the Department of Education. During the culmination phase of his service life, when he was promoted to the higher ranks, he put the experiences derived from years of dedication and hard work to the best use. During his time, many commendable reforms took place in education field, with particular reference to education of the Muslim students, due to his personal initiative. Below are some of the educational reform programmes undertaken during his time: 
              <ol> 
               <li>During that time, there was the tradition of writing the names of the students in the examination papers. Many people believed that this open-identity went against the interests of a section of the students (due to communal reasons). For this reason, Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) went all out to introduce the system of writing the roll numbers of students instead of their names. This was first applied in the Honours and Masters examinations and later also followed in the Intermediate and Bachelors degree examinations of the time. <br><br></li>
               <li>He elevated the standard of education in both the higher madrasah and secondary madrasah classes and created congenial atmosphere for the students to enter colleges and universities after completing the madrasah education. <br><br></li>
               <li>During that time, he created posts for maulavis or Muslim religious teachers in all schools and colleges and eliminated the wage disparity between the Hindu pundits or priests and Muslim maulavis. <br><br></li>
               <li>Urdu, during those days was not considered among the "classical languages". This created problems for the Urdu-speaking students in West Bengal. It was through his initiative that Urdu occupied the place of Sanskrit. <br><br></li>
               <li>It was dint of his active initiative that the proposal for establishing a separate college exclusively for the Muslim students in Calcutta was approved. This gave birth to the Islamia College. The principal of Calcutta Madrasah Mr. Hurley was appointed the first Principal of the college. <br><br></li>
               <li>He was instrumental in establishing many muktabs or elementary religious schools, madrasahs, Muslim high schools and it was for him that many Muslim teachers got their appointments. The Baker Hostel, Taylor Hostel, Karmichael Hostel, Moslem Institute etc., situated at the heart of Calcutta, hold evidence to his contribution. <br><br></li>
               <li>The Fuller Hostel of Rajshahi is glowing witness to his immortal contributions. During the construction of this hostel for the Muslim students, he faced multifaceted obstacles. In spite of continuous hurdles set by the opposition and their negative remarks, such as, "why waste so much money to build a hostel in an earthquake-prone area like Rajshahi what is the use", he managed the required permission and funding form the British authorities to build the hostel. <br><br></li>
               <li>He introduced an independent educational curriculum for the muktab students and made provisions so that Muslim students could study the books written by Muslim scholars. This created the opportunity for Muslim scholars to write textbooks and also improve the lot of the Muslim book-publishers. For the founding and survival of institutions like Makhdumi Library, Provincial Library and Islamia Library, he had enormous contributions. <br><br></li>
               <li>In the schools and colleges, he readjusted the ration of stipends for the Muslim students and made provisions so that increasing number of poor but meritorious students could study free of cost. He also removed the hurdles faced by the Muslim students in receiving government fellowships to for higher learning in foreign countries. <br><br></li>
               <li>It was through his initiative that the representative and membership of the Muslim community was ensured in the Textbook Committee. He also made some readjustments in the volume of representation by the Muslim examiners, in the number of Muslim inspection officials in the Department of Education, in the volume of Muslim students studying at the training college and also in the number of representation by Muslims in the managing committees of schools and colleges. <br><br></li>
               <li>It was through his efforts that the New Scheme Madrasah, which introduced education in English side by side Arabic, was established. He also played a pioneering role in consolidating the status f Arabic as the "second language" in the high schools. <br><br></li>
               <li>Some specialized schools and colleges were founded for the female Muslim students as a result of his personal initiative. He prepared congenial atmosphere for them to receive education and become complete human beings. <br><br></li>
               <li>Besides, the Governor of undivided Bengal on June 30, 1914, through Resolution No. 2474, formed a high-level committee to propose recommendations for the improvement of three distinct streams of Muslim education. The Director of the Provincial Assembly was appointed the chairman of the committee. Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) was one of the leading members of the committee. The recommendations of this committee had a far-reaching impact on the development and progress of Muslim education. <br><br></li>
               <li>In those days, Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) represented in all the committees and conferences relating to education in East Bengal either as member or in any other official capacities. When a furious debate took hold of the Legislative Assembly regarding the Medium of Education, the then Chief Secretary brought to the notice of the assembly, an article written in this regard by Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.). <br><br></li>
               <li>He also had active contributions in the formation of Dhaka University. A major hue and cry was raised when the draft bill on Dhaka University was placed before the Senate and a special committee was formed later on to recommend on the issue. As an outstanding member of the committee, highlighting the need for such an institution, he recommended that the bill be passed. </li>

               He had declared in unequivocal terms: "Social welfare should ideally be the aim of literature". He also said: "A nation which does not have its own literature does not have self-esteem. The development of such a nation will always be a forlorn prospect. If one is to introduce oneself as a true Muslim and an equal to the rest of the world, then one has to uphold one's mother tongue with a nationalistic fervour. For restoring the very existence of the nation, the development of the Bengali language is a must."

               Aiming at social welfare, national development and refinement of the individualistic characteristics of people, Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) published a number of autobiographical books on great men.

               Along with reflecting on the instructions of Islam, he presented in his writings, the inherent loftiness and the very essence of such religious creeds which made them so unique. This trend can be well observed in the books like Sufi, Shristitatta, Islamer Mahati Shiksha and Tariqat Shiksha. He believed, "the educated people of the time have keen interest for the deep mysteries of Islam. But the stringent rules of the shariah (the traditions) refrained them from delving into such mysteries. Few people, however, could understand that by piercing the hard rules of the shariah, they could find a passage into the world of unknown knowledge and bliss".

               He took to writing as a means of reviving the Muslim s from the wretched condition they were in at that crucial point of time. But the very skill of his writing and the novelty in the presentation of the subject matters which had an unmistakable individualistic touch, transcended them from the temporal to the eternal, eventually earning them the honour of creative literature. By involving himself with the activities of various literary organizations, he also made literary endeavours and practice easy for others.

It was he who set the aims and objectives of the Mission: Praying for the grace of the Creator and serving those created by Him. Selfless service was one of the most distinct features of his life. He wrote in his autobiography on this: "I have set my life's goal to serve people living far away from the cities. The pleasure that offering of service gives, cannot be found in personal aggrandizement. Boundless love will not come unless the element of 'self' is negated. If there is no love for the creation, there cannot be any love for the Creator. The only aims of my life are to extend brotherhood. Fraternity and spread the message of peace".

               Khan Bahadur Ahsanullah (R.) was an extremely pious man. In his spiritual quest, he received a good measure of attainment. In 1909, he received his spiritual bayat in the hands of the famous Hazrat Shah Gafur (r) of Patna and became a member of the Quaderia -Waresia Selsela. Today, he is revered by all as a very successful peer or saint. However, for the novelty of his perceptions, thoughts and religious beliefs, he could not be put in the same league with the other peers of the time. Rather than communication with his followers from the elevated position of a saint, he always emerged before them as a friend.

Therefore, to look down on one's follower and take undue privilege from him, is an act of foolishness. The relation between the two is a divine one, not a worldly one.

People from all nations and communities have, therefore, embraced and skill is embracing the principles of Islam without any reservations. However, it totally prohibits the tendency to sneer at people from other religious faiths, communities and national identities. All the creations are the making of one benevolent Creator.

               <li>" The meaning of the world - Islam - ..is surrender, endearment and peace. Muslims discard petty personal interests for the greater well being of the world. Through surrendering the self, a Muslim becomes one with the universal reality or the ultimate truth. A Muslim shows his love for the Almighty by serving Him. Islam dedicates the goods delivered by man for the well being of the universe. By discarding transitory happiness, Islam embraces perpetual happiness.

It is, therefore, a matter of great shame and ignominy when a truly religious person speaks to others harshly, looks down on others with disdain and resorts to cruelty and lies.

In the real life drama of the family, the person who lords over his family, will also be held accountable and made to answer on how well he looked after his family members. In the husband's house, sometimes the wife is seen to emerge as the ruler and this will make her account for her deeds. Even the servant can sometimes become a ruler and he also has to account for the responsibilities that are vested on him". -- Bangla Hadis Sharif <br><br></li>
               <li>"One of the cardinal instructions of Islam is to establish or offer zakaat. It is instructed that the rich should help the poor by offering zakaat in the rate of 2.5 percent from his fixed income. This will help breed friendship, global fraternity, and along with it, promote global peace. Without sacrificing the heads of rich people to the sword or to the destructive powers of atoms, the rich should take the advantage of financially helping the poor and both should join together in harmony to develop this world. This is the aim of the Creator". -.. Islam O Zakaat <br><br></li>

It has everything -. rules of religion, rules of society, rules of statesmanship, rules of education and rules of home-economics. Every alphabet, word and line of it is an expression of originality, which rejects dualism. It is an impressive combination of theology and philosophy.

               <li>" Maya or longing is the main hindrance to reaching the source of the hidden power. Occasional longings put a tab on the regular source of power and strength. The Almighty has given all human being the essential hidden power. He wants that by exercising that hidden power given by Him, human beings come out victorious against the forces of worldly desires and longings. The creation of human desires and longings also testifies to the benevolence of the Almighty. If there were no testes or trails, then there would not have been any justification for crime and punishment, hell and heaven and the aim of creation would have remained incomplete. Every reward, therefore, entails a hard test. On the Day of Judgment, the Almighty will be present as the examiner to judge the rewards and the punishments, it is His wish". --.Amar Shiksha O Diksha. </li>
