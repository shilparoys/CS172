             <h4>Important Information</h4> 
             <p>Scholarships now available for one year, tuition-free training toward employment in the high-tech, career fields of realtime court reporting or captioning!</p> 
             <p>An exceptional scholarship opportunity is currently available for new students enrolled in Green River's Computer Reporting Technologies program.<strong> Students beginning their education toward either the Court Reporting or Captioning degrees are encouraged to apply for the Realtime Writers Scholarship which will cover all tuition costs for the traditional academic year (three quarters). </strong></p>

Rapozo, CCR, RPR, CRI" width="118">I am a proud graduate of Green River Community College’s Court Reporting Program. I began reporting in 1980 and officially stopped reporting, but not writing on my machine, in 1992. During those years, I was a freelance court reporter with extensive reporting in the federal court system. I’ve reported all over Washington state and also in my home state of North Dakota.</p> 
             <p>My teaching career began in the Tri-Cities, where I taught privately. I also began an evening Court Reporting program at Columbia Basin College. Here I taught for three years before moving to Yakima and then back to Western Washington to continue my court reporting career. I began teaching at Green River Community College in the fall of 1991.</p> 
             <p>I enjoy overseeing the court reporting interns and coordinating with the University of Washington and Seattle University law schools to report their mock depositions and mock trials. I started implementing online court reporting courses in the spring of 2002, and currently teach onsite and online courses. Presently, I am serving on NCRA's Council on Approved Student Education, local committees, and I help facilitate the NCRA exams and Washington CCR exam.</p> 
             <p>In 2001, I was honored with Green River's Distinguished Faculty award and in 2009, I received <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NCRA's CASE Instructor of the Year award.</span> The students energize me and I truly enjoy the opportunity to help them achieve their goals.</p> 
             <p>When I’m not at school, I enjoy snow skiing, kayaking, and hiking with my family and friends. My hobbies include cross-stitch, cooking, baking, and holding babies.</p>

I became interested in court reporting while serving on jury duty. After attending Green River Community College’s Reporting Program, I did some work as a CART provider. Now, as a college instructor, I get to blend all those things together into one incredible job. I have been teaching evening classes at Green River Community College since 2006 and became a Certified Reporting Instructor (CRI) through NCRA in early 2008.</p> 
             <p>When not dictating or grading papers, I like to watch Survivor and read sci-fi/fantasy novels. I also like to spend time with my husband and teenage daughter, especially on our annual summer road trip. There’s nothing like 24/7 in a Subaru to promote family togetherness. My husband restores classic cars and my daughter plays the saxophone and is a camp counselor in the summer, so there is rarely a dull moment around the Ladderud household.</p>

I worked as a freelance court reporter in the Seattle area for approximately six years.</p> 
             <p>Unfortunately, a car accident left me unable to report any longer, and I found myself back at Green River, but this time in a teaching capacity! I instructed in the day and evening classes, working with beginning theory and speedbuilding students up to speeds of 140 wpm.</p> 
             <p>After a few years, I had an opportunity to work in court reporting sales at Stenograph as a district sales manager, where I utilized my court reporting and teaching skills to work with many state associations, court reporting and law firms, courthouses and captioning companies. I am now back at Green River, in a teaching capacity, and am very excited to see so many eager new students!</p>

An attorney and expert in digital media, I bring a unique perspective to helping companies develop new‐media solutions to old‐world problems. My current interests are business applications of social networks, streaming media, and the use of evolving technologies to deliver barrier‐free communication.</p> 
             <p>As an “army brat” who grew up all over the world, my exposure to a variety of cultures and lifestyles helped to shape my truly global perspective. I am passionate about diversity, inclusion and accessibility. My strong value system and sense of purpose were shaped by my father, Bruce “Snake” Crandall, a true American hero made famous in the movie We Were Soldiers and a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions in Vietnam.</p> 
             <p>My previous experience as CEO of a multinational consulting firm providing marketing and client servicing to some of the world’s leading firms‐‐such as Chase Manhattan, Wells Fargo, Grady White Boats, Kleinwort Benson U.K., and the Government of Singapore--combined with my knowledge of technology, make me a natural and strategically powerful business partner.</p> 
             <p>At present, I am the managing director of ProMotion Arts, LLC, a full‐spectrum new media company that I founded in Seattle, Washington. ProMotion Arts works with clients including Microsoft, Starbucks, Vonage, General Mills, Hilti, and the state of Washington, among others, to deliver new media solutions and accessible communications via the web and traditional media.</p> 
             <p>Premiere Realtime, the legal services division of ProMotion Arts, offers a wide range of technology‐based solutions to law firms and corporate clients. I am an expert on the use of technology in litigation support and at trial and have worked on a number of high profile cases including the September 11 litigation, Exxon Valdez, City of Seattle vs. Professional Basketball Club, EEOC vs. United Airlines, Lucent vs. Microsoft, and U.S. Olympic Committee vs. S.O.C.</p>

             <p>I hold a number of professional certifications and have received many awards and professional recognitions, including the Greater Seattle Business Association Business Man of the Year Award.</p>

             <p><img alt="Eleanor Mitchell, CCR, RPR" class="border6" height="136" src="Images/academic-programs/Areas%20of%20Study/court-reporting/eleanor-mitchell.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Eleanor Mitchell, CCR, RPR" width="118">I can’t say enough about the training I received in the Green River Community College Court Reporting Program. From the qualified and truly caring instructors, to the relevant and timely curriculum, I was prepared for any and every situation when I began reporting. While the course content is rigorous, it is worth it when you can tackle any subject matter outside the classroom. And there were many opportunities to apply the classroom teaching to real-world scenarios through mock trials, realtime scenarios and in-depth procedures classes. I am privileged to call myself a Green River Community College graduate.</p> 
             <h4>Kim Rashell, VITAC</h4> 
             <p><img alt="Kim Rashell" class="border6" height="136" src="Images/academic-programs/Areas%20of%20Study/court-reporting/kim-rashell.jpg" style="float: right;" title="Kim Rashell" width="118">After being laid off from a job in the pharmaceutical industry, I did quite a lot of soul searching and decided that my next path would lead me to a career rather than a job. I turned to the Court Reporting Technologies Program at Green River Community College and have never looked back. The instruction and opportunities offered through the college led me to a career as a closed captioner with a prestigious national captioning company. Now, instead of answering to a boss looking over my shoulder, I answer to my toddler as I get to be a work-at-home mommy. It’s the best of both worlds. I love my new career, and I owe it all to my training at Green River.</p>

When I discovered the Court Reporting Technologies Program at Green River Community College, I knew I had found the perfect fit for my life. The program offered me a well-rounded and thorough education, encompassing all the various fields where I could apply my skills I had developed through the guidance and training of the teachers. Since receiving my Associate in Applied Arts in Court Reporting Technology, I have found employment in the Seventh Judicial District Court for the state of Montana. Now two years down the road, I am enjoying a rewarding career in a part of the country I love.</p>
