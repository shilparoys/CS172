         <p>You’ll be <strong>plunged into a world dramatically different from our own</strong> when you’re a Medieval Studies minor.

          Medievalists were among the first to embrace digital technology for studying the humanities. Why? Because we needed ways to better organize and understand rich archives. 
         <strong>Our field led the way</strong>.

          The study of the Middle Ages has been interdisciplinary for a long time. 
         <strong>Just look at the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis</strong>, for example. Our interdisciplinary program includes scholars from all across campus who help you use the lens of the past to rethink the present and future.

          There are plenty of opportunities to do firsthand research both at home and overseas. Drew possesses an expansive archival collection perfect for exploring, and the 
         <strong>Drew International Seminar to Santiago, Spain</strong>, looks—through pilgrimage—at the interconnectedness of the medieval world. This is just one of many study-abroad options.

               <p>This course examines the history of ten centuries of Islamic art and architecture both chronologically and thematically. It begins with a study of medieval Islamic art of the Near East and Mediterranean, examining major themes and regional variations. Study will then shift to select monuments of Islamic art from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The focus may include architecture and manuscript painting, with some attention also to metalwork, pottery, and textiles. Issues considered may include: Islamic aesthetic attitudes, definitions of Islamic art, adaptations of a late antique artistic vocabulary, cross-cultural influence, architecture and ritual, and ideology and style in manuscript painting.</p>

               <p>This class examines the history of illustrated books from late antiquity through the early modern period, from early Christian Rome to Mughal India. Manuscripts and early printed books will be considered in terms of their original function and owners as well as how they have been used, collected, and appreciated up to the present day. The main concerns of the course will be the way in which the images in the manuscripts convey meaning in ways complementary to and beyond the text, reflect the interests of their patrons and the stylistic and economic concerns of their artists, and act as evidence of the devotional, social, and political contexts in which the books were produced.</p>

Important topics include: the rise of the Papacy, the break with Byzantine Christianity, monasticism, sacred space, the medieval "discovery of the self," the mendicant orders (Franciscans and Dominicans), Eucharistic theology, the origins of the university, natural theology, late medieval mysticism, and the break up of Christendom in the sixteenth century. "Popular" religious practices, such as cults of the saints, miracles, and the unique artistic genius of the medieval cathedral are placed in a broader context. Fruitful Christian coexistence as well as violent conflict with Islam and Judaism are also considered, as are the multiplicity of "heretical" Christianities (including Catharism and Waldensians).</p>

               <p>This course investigates and compares the relgious origins of the ideas of crusade and jihad. In both cases a devotional practice became militarized; we will discuss how these practices became militarized both theologically and practically. We consider the contested spaces of the Mediterranean, including Jerusalem, that fostered the delvelopment of these forms of religious warfare. We will then examine how these ideas became transformed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in movements and events as varied as romanticism, the Red Cross, colonialism, World War I, Pan-Arabism, and Wahhabism. All of these reimagined, idealized, and represented the medieval world (Latin or Arabic) so as to promote radically different agendas.</p>

               <p>This course considers one of the most influential authors in the Western world. We will take the entire spiritual journey from hell to heaven and of Dante's Divine Comedy and consider it in Dante's medieval intellectual, literary and political context. In addition to the Comedy, we read selections from Dante's On Monarchy and The New Life. Other primary texts include selections from Aquinas, Bonaventure, Guido Cavalcanti, Boccaccio's Life of Dante, and Dino Compagni's Chronicle of Florence, along with other contemporary chronicles as we examine medieval Florence and the intellectual background of the Comedy. This course is a seminar emphasizing class discussion and written research assignments of different lengths. This counts as an Italian "Language in Context" course. The course employs a student-generated "geographic database" as a research tool. This database of primary texts and images allows the students to rapidly immerse themselves in Dante's contemporary Florence and better understand how Dante used the particular details of his surroundings to build poetic image and metaphor.</p>

               <p>An overview of Western art music from ancient Greece to the music of Bach and Handel. We will study a core repertoire of music in its historical contexts and explore debates of what these pieces may have sounded like when they were first performed.

               <p>This course traces the history of Christianity from the death of Jesus to the break up of the Roman empire (seventh century) and the rise of Islam. Important theological questions (such as: who is Jesus [Christology]; what does he do [soteriology]; the nature of God; why is there evil in the world [theodicy]) are considered and placed in the context of ancient Roman history and philosophy. These considerations help us to understand the meaning of Christian martyrdom, the effect of Constantine's conversion, the origins of Christian worship and sacred space (Constantine's St. Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, in particular), ecclesiastical and clerical orders (bishops and priests, for example), monasticism, the doctrine of "original sin," and apocalyptic expectations. The appeal of alternate Christianities such as Gnosticism and Arianism and the decline of Classical religion are also considered. Offered fall semester in even-numbered years.</p>

               <p>A broad introduction to the world's second largest religion. Topics covered include a brief historical overview of the life and mission of the Prophet Muhammad, the rise of the early Islamic community, and the formation of Islamic civilization. Additional units focus on the nature and structure of the Qur'an, the role of Islamic law, aspects of ritual practice, and expressions of Muslim spirituality. Relying heavily on primary textual sources in translation, students consider issues such as the relationship between religion and politics, women and society, and themes of unity and variety in the Islamic tradition.</p>

               <p>This course analyzes religion as cultural traditions that have influentially defined the South Asian region across the centuries and up to the present, largely through a consideration of the literature, arts, and practices of India. Thematic topics include social definitions of community, traditional depictions of status according to occupation, class and gender, and the creation of paths of ethical behavior that promote social cohesion. We explore these themes through historical interactions among traditions as well as challenges to and the use of tradition in the present day. Primary texts in translation, art and documentary film are central to the course of study. </p>

               <p>This course begins by examining the origins of reformation in the history of Christianity. We then trace some of the key questions that become central to the fifteenth- and sixteenth- century reformers. Topics will include: the nature, language and availability of the Bible; papal power; devotional practices (prayer books, indulgences, and the Eucharist); and grace and free will. We shall examine the critiques of these practices and theologies by reformers such as Wycliffe, Hus, Erasmus, Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin. We shall also examine the Catholic reformation, the Council of Trent and the origins of Roman Catholicism. Other topics include the rise of the modern state, witchcraft, Inquisition, and women as reformers and objects of reform. The final portion of the course will focus on the English Reformation and work directly with Drew's 16th- and 17th- century collection of English prayer books in the Maser Collection. The course will have an examination, a short essay on on.</p>
