      <h2>Careers Made easy</h2> 
      <h3>Beat this</h3> 
      <p>Our students have gone on to prestigious graduate performance programs in music. Others are already <strong>working performers and composers and conductors</strong>. And because Drew offers a really great liberal arts program, some have become physicians and attorneys.</p> 
      <p>Music faculty insisted on hiring a world-class acoustician when we built <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drew.edu/news/2013/03/12/looks-beautiful-sounds-beautiful">our new concert hall</a>. The result is <strong>sound that attracts major artists</strong>, including Grammy-winning soprano Dawn Upshaw and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, to perform and record here.</p> 
      <p>We have so many double majors—music/theatre arts, music/religious studies, music/German, music/neuroscience. Our grads are out succeeding in lots of fields, and <strong>still enjoying the music</strong>.</p>

               <p>Musicians must be conversant with the instruments commonly used in compositions in western music. This course will study each instrument in the common-practice orchestra and include its history, construction, timbre (tonal quality) and individual writing techniques endemic to its tonal color. As the course progresses, these instruments will be combined into families (string, woodwind, brass and percussion) and then finally as a full orchestra. Students will work with music writing software and instrumental sampling software so they can hear the results of their orchestrations.</p>

               <p>Musicians must be conversant with the instruments commonly used in compositions in western music. This course will study each instrument in the common-practice orchestra and include its history, construction, timbre (tonal quality) and individual writing techniques endemic to its tonal color. As the course progresses, these instruments will be combined into families (string, woodwind, brass and percussion) and then finally as a full orchestra. Students will work with music writing software and instrumental sampling software so they can hear the results of their orchestrations.</p>
