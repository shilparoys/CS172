         <p>Conventional wisdom is pretty clear on how to get ahead in one’s professional life. Rack up accomplishments, collect accolades, make your résumé as impressive as possible, we’re told, and rewards will follow. That all sounds nice—but it might not be true. In fact, social science suggests, the key to success might actually be to achieve <em>less</em> while promising more.</p>

The researchers discovered that references to potential, such as “this person could win an award for their work,” appear to stimulate greater interest than similar references to actual accomplishments (“this person <em>has </em>won an award for their work”). This tendency, the paper states, “creates a phenomenon whereby the potential to be good at something can be preferred over actually being good at that very same thing.”</p>

         <p>The professors demonstrated as much in a series of experiments in which test subjects were asked to choose between the proven and the possible. In one case, participants were asked to rate two job candidates: one with two years of experience and demonstrated leadership achievement, and the other with no experience but high leadership potential.</p> 
         <p>Despite the more experienced candidate having objectively superior credentials, subjects preferred the candidate with potential. They also implicitly predicted this candidate would be a better leader in his fifth year on the job than the more experienced candidate would be in his seventh year.</p> 
         <p>In another experiment, participants read two letters of recommendation for an applicant to a business Ph.D. program. Both versions were nearly identical, but one stressed possible talent (“Mark K. is a student of great potential”), while the other highlighted accomplishment (“Mark K. is a student of great achievement”). Once again, the subjects preferred the applicant with potential.</p>
         <div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3715867"></div> 
         <p>Why are people so drawn to the possible, even over proven results? The researchers suggest it’s simply a matter of uncertainty being more interesting than a sure thing. “Our finding is that people find potential to be exciting uncertainty,” says Zakary Tormala, one of the study’s authors and a professor at the Stanford School of Business. That makes a candidate with potential more stimulating than a safer choice, and often leads to a more positive impression.</p> 
         <p>Workers can use this quirk of psychology to their advantage by emphasizing their future value, in addition to past achievements, when applying for a job or asking for a raise. “One of the places we’ve encouraged people to make this happen is in their reference letters,” says Michael Norton, another of the study’s co-authors and professor at Harvard Business School. References “generally talk about what someone has done,” Norton says. “That’s not a bad thing to do, but it’s very important to also talk about their potential.” It can be particularly important for high achieving employees who might be more inclined to stress their accomplishments over their continued capacity for growth.</p> 
         <p>However, the professor notes, the allure of potential isn’t unlimited. In the recommendation letter experiment, researchers found that participants stopped favoring potential over success when claims of potential lacked sufficient evidence to back them up. Instead, it’s best to highlight a combination of past accomplishments and future possibilities, so no one suspects you’re hype without substance. “A mix is critical,” Norton explains. “There has to be some demonstrated sense that you’ve achieved things.”</p> 
         <p>Use it right, and our collective preference for potential can do more than get you a better job. Norton says it could also get you a date. “The classic terrible first date is the man drones on about achievements,” the professor jokes. “But if you talk about what you want to do, even if you’re not going to get there, it can be more exciting.”</p>

The researchers discovered that references to potential, such as &#8220;this person could win an award for their work,&#8221; appear to stimulate greater interest than similar references to actual accomplishments (&#8220;this person <em>has <\/em>won an award for their work&#8221;). This tendency, the paper states, &#8220;creates a phenomenon whereby the potential to be good at something can be preferred over actually being good at that very same thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-mag\" data-name=\"rr-mag\"><div class=\"read-more-inline magazine has-cover\"><h6 class=\"read-more-list-h read-more-popular\">Popular Among Time Subscribers<\/h6>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"popular-lead\"><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3639421\/amy-schumer-americas-class-clown\/?pcd=pw-pas\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/amy-schumer-funny-girl.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;w=560\" alt=\"Star Track: Amy Schumer\u2019s movie Trainwreck\" title=\"Star Track: Amy Schumer\u2019s movie Trainwreck, directed by Judd Apatow, is out in July.\" data-loaded=\"true\"><\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3639421\/amy-schumer-americas-class-clown\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Amy Schumer: Class Clown of 2015<\/h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/subscription.time.com\/storefront\/subscribe-to-time\/link\/1019509.html\" class=\"subscribe-button\">Subscribe<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3643778\/u-s-cuba-relations\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Cuba Libre<\/h3><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/198\/bitter-pill-why-medical-bills-are-killing-us\/?pcd=pw-pas\" class=\"read-more-article\" format-article><h3 class=\"read-more-inline-title time-icons time-icons-key\">Bitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us<\/h3><\/a><\/div><\/aside><p>The professors demonstrated as much in a series of experiments in which test subjects were asked to choose between the proven and the possible. In one case, participants were asked to rate two job candidates: one with two years of experience and demonstrated leadership achievement, and the other with no experience but high leadership potential.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the more experienced candidate having objectively superior credentials, subjects preferred the candidate with potential. They also implicitly predicted this candidate would be a better leader in his fifth year on the job than the more experienced candidate would be in his seventh year.<\/p>\n<p>In another experiment, participants read two letters of recommendation for an applicant to a business Ph.D. program. Both versions were nearly identical, but one stressed possible talent (&#8220;Mark K. is a student of great potential&#8221;), while the other highlighted accomplishment (&#8220;Mark K. is a student of great achievement&#8221;). Once again, the subjects preferred the applicant with potential.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3715867\"><\/div>\n<p>Why are people so drawn to the possible, even over proven results? The researchers suggest it&#8217;s simply a matter of uncertainty being more interesting than a sure thing. &#8220;Our finding is that people find potential to be exciting uncertainty,&#8221; says Zakary Tormala, one of the study&#8217;s authors and a professor at the Stanford School of Business. That makes a candidate with potential more stimulating than a safer choice, and often leads to a more positive impression.<\/p>\n<p>Workers can use this quirk of psychology to their advantage by emphasizing their future value, in addition to past achievements, when applying for a job or asking for a raise. &#8220;One of the places we&#8217;ve encouraged people to make this happen is in their reference letters,&#8221; says Michael Norton, another of the study&#8217;s co-authors and professor at Harvard Business School. References &#8220;generally talk about what someone has done,&#8221; Norton says. &#8220;That&rsquo;s not a bad thing to do, but it&rsquo;s very important to also talk about their potential.&#8221; It can be particularly important for high achieving employees who might be more inclined to stress their accomplishments over their continued capacity for growth.<\/p>\n<p>However, the professor notes, the allure of potential isn&#8217;t unlimited. In the recommendation letter experiment, researchers found that participants stopped favoring potential over success when claims of potential lacked sufficient evidence to back them up. Instead, it&#8217;s best to highlight a combination of past accomplishments and future possibilities, so no one suspects you&#8217;re hype without substance. &#8220;A mix is critical,&#8221; Norton explains. &#8220;There has to be some demonstrated sense that you&#8217;ve achieved things.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Use it right, and our collective preference for potential can do more than get you a better job. Norton says it could also get you a date. &#8220;The classic terrible first date is the man drones on about achievements,&#8221; the professor jokes. &#8220;But if you talk about what you want to do, even if you&#8217;re not going to get there, it can be more exciting.&#8221;<\/p><aside class=\"right-rail-module rr-ad\" data-name=\"rr-ad\"><div class=\"right-rail-ad\"

The financial crisis forced many middle-income investors to liquidate their stock holdings in order to weather the following years of financial hardship.<\/p>\n<p><a><img class=\" size-portrait_small_2x wp-image-3723823 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/150226_inv_galluppoll.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=color\" alt=\"150226_INV_GallupPoll\" width=\"560\" align=\"middle\"><\/a><\/p>\n<figure class=\"image-wrapper\"><\/figure><p>And nobody is under the illusion that everyone&rsquo;s getting rich.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/scspi\/_media\/working_papers\/pfeffer-danziger-schoeni_wealth-levels.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a> financed by the Russell Sage foundation found that the median household&rsquo;s net worth declined by $32,000 between 2003 and 2013, from almost $87,992 to $56,335. That means a typical household <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/2917709\/wealth-inequality-doubled-over-last-10-years-study-finds\/\" target=\"_blank\">lost 36% of its wealth in 10 years.<\/a> Yet in that same 10 year time-span, not only the Nasdaq has boomed back. The S&amp;P 500, the most commonly used indicator of stock market health, is up 60%.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that fewer Americans are invested in the market is only part of the issue. Study co-author Fabian Pfeffer says home equity made up more than half of the median household&rsquo;s wealth in 2007, just before the housing crash. Worse, the housing market has improved far more slowly than the stock market, resulting in a much slower recovery for middle-income households.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3723764\"><\/div>\n<figure class=\"image-wrapper\"><a><img class=\" wp-image-3723859 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/02\/ycharts_chart-5.png?w=560&#038;h=331\" alt=\"ycharts_chart-5\" width=\"560\" height=\"331\" align=\"middle\"><\/a><\/figure><figure class=\"image-wrapper\"><\/figure><p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image-wrapper\"><\/figure><figure class=\"image-wrapper\"><\/figure><p>And so volatility has tended to amplify inequality, even when markets eventually bounce back. While the average American was forced to divest from the stock market when shares were (in hindsight now) cheap, wealthier people were not, meaning the latter group has benefited more when the economy improved. Wealthier Americans also had a higher percentage of their wealth outside the real estate market. Pfeffer says the median household in the richest 5th percentile held just 16% of their wealth in home equity, with the rest primarily held in either business assets (49%) or financial instruments like stocks and bonds (25%).<\/p>\n<p>The end result? America&rsquo;s wealthiest households prospered in the aftermath of the financial crisis as the stock market improved, while the middle class was largely passed over. Pfeffer&rsquo;s research found the richest 5% of Americans held 24 times the wealth of the median household in 2013, up from 13 times the wealth of a typical household in 2003. In other words, wealth inequality essentially doubled over the last decade.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"2\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-3845604448001-2\"

Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well over 10 years at the helm. (It&#8217;s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65 either (or have you noticed?). &#8230; <strong>Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO<\/strong> &#8212; a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. <strong>In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Who might the successor be? Munger offers a clue that appears to narrow it down to two individuals (my emphasis):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>But under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be &#8220;of only moderate ability.&#8221; For instance, <strong>Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as &#8220;world-class.&#8221;<\/strong> &#8220;World-leading&#8221; would be the description I would choose. <strong>In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance head Ajit Jain is 63, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO<a href=\"http:\/\/www.midamericanenergy.com\/newsroom\/aspx\/bios.aspx\">Greg Abel<\/a> is 52. In terms of age and expected tenure, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/bw\/articles\/2014-05-01\/could-greg-abel-replace-warren-buffett-at-berkshire-hathaway\">Abel has the advantage<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The timing of the elusive Berkshire dividend<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Another recurring debate in the financial media is the value and timing of a potential Berkshire dividend &#8212; although, as we shall see, it&#8217;s not much of a debate among shareholders. Buffett provides his first time-bound guidelines:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Eventually &#8212; probably between 10 and 20 years from now &#8212; Berkshire&#8217;s earnings and capital resources will reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company&#8217;s earnings. At that time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings is through dividends, share repurchases, or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value, massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directors will make the right decision.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t appear to be a problem for current shareholders:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Nevertheless [in response to last year&#8217;s proxy motion requesting a dividend], 98% of the shares voting said, in effect, &#8220;Don&#8217;t send us a dividend but instead reinvest all of the earnings.&#8221; To have our fellow owners &#8212; large and small &#8212; be so in sync with our managerial philosophy is both remarkable and rewarding. I am a lucky fellow to have you as partners.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Munger&#8217;s contribution to Berkshire<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although he has remained in Buffett&#8217;s shadow over the past 50 years, it&#8217;s almost impossible to overstate Munger&#8217;s contribution to Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett pays tribute to it:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>From my perspective, though, Charlie&#8217;s most important architectural feat was the design of today&#8217;s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices. &#8230; Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his logic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie&#8217;s blueprint. My role has been that of general contractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire&#8217;s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>The 4 keys to Berkshire&#8217;s success<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Munger returns Buffett&#8217;s compliment:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well?<\/p>\n<p>Only four large factors occur to me: (1) the constructive peculiarities of Buffett, (2) the constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system, (3) good luck, and (4) the weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the press.<\/p>\n<p>I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive peculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions. In particular, Buffett&#8217;s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to keep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became good at tennis.<\/p>\n<p>Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach John Wooden, who won most regularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponents always faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improved more than was normal.<\/p>\n<p>And Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person, not seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deteriorating like the skill of a basketball player does.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3728211\"><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"3\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object id=\"bc-video-4066125790001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/money.us\/1GH24ky\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"TIME_onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4066125790001\"><\/object><\/div>\n<h3><strong>The Berkshire system: 15 rules for building a world-leading conglomerate<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>What is this &#8220;Berkshire system&#8221; Munger refers to, which has been at the core of Berkshire&#8217;s unparalleled success? He codifies it in 15 points:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called &#8220;the Berkshire system&#8221;) were fixed early and are described below:<\/p>\n<p>(1) Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make useful predictions.<\/p>\n<p>(2) Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOs would operate with very extreme autonomy.<\/p>\n<p>(3) There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing a chairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc.<\/p>\n<p>(4) Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a group would be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producing substantial &#8220;float&#8221; (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment.<\/p>\n<p>(5) There would be no significant systemwide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system, retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different.<\/p>\n<p>(6) Berkshire&#8217;s chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself. [&#8230;]<\/p>\n<p>(7) New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock.<\/p>\n<p>(8) Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders was being created by each dollar of retained earnings.<\/p>\n<p>(9) In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the chairman could pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for a long time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>(10) In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love for the business and circumstances the CEO was in.<\/p>\n<p>(11) As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary.<\/p>\n<p>(12) Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary&#8217;s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary.<\/p>\n<p>(13) Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age.<\/p>\n<p>(14) Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthiness under all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusual opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>(15) Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such a business would get prompt attention. No one but the chairman and one or two others at Berkshire would ever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.<\/p>\n<p>Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I know of has half of such elements in place.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><strong>The continued success of Berkshire after Buffett<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Will the &#8220;Berkshire system&#8221; ensure continued success, despite its size, and after Buffett? Buffett says yes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning power of Berkshire. That does not mean operating earnings will increase each year &#8212; far from it. The U.S. economy will ebb and flow &#8212; though mostly flow &#8212; and when it weakens, so will our current earnings. But we will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions, and enter new fields. I believe, therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Munger concurs:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett were soon to depart. The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable competitive advantage. Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new fixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise &#8220;bolt-on&#8221; acquisitions.<\/p>\n<p>Provided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present is so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if (1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never again purchased a large business.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>These quotes provide some of the important lessons from this year&#8217;s letter, but the document is extraordinarily rich in business and investing lessons and will be analyzed and debated for years to come &#8212; including here on Fool.com.

The Obama administration <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cms.gov\/Newsroom\/MediaReleaseDatabase\/Press-releases\/2015-Press-releases-items\/2015-02-20.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced<\/a> a special open enrollment period last Friday. If you still don&#8217;t have 2015 health coverage, you did not know about the tax penalty until you worked on your tax return, <em>and <\/em>you owe a penalty for 2014, you <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3716843\/obamacare-extension-tax-penalty\/\" target=\"_blank\">can enroll in a 2015 plan<\/a> via <a href=\"http:\/\/healthcare.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Healthcare.gov<\/a> between March 15 and April 30. The second chance is available to people who live in the 34 states with a federally-run insurance marketplace and who file their federal taxes after February 15.<\/p>\n<p>This deadline extension could help a lot of people: Late last year, 44% of uninsured Americans said they had heard little to nothing about Obamacare&#8217;s individual tax penalty, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/hrms.urban.org\/quicktakes\/As-of-December-Man-Uninsured-Adults-Were-Not-Aware-of-Tax-Penalties.html\" target=\"_blank\">a poll by the Urban Institute<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a twist, however: To qualify for the extension, you must be subject to the tax penalty, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. But most Americans who are still uninsured could qualify for <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3692111\/obamacare-open-enrollment-deadline\/\" target=\"_blank\">an exemption<\/a> from the tax. Take it, and you don&#8217;t get more time to buy health coverage for this year.<\/p>\n<h3>The Choice<\/h3>\n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/fees-exemptions\/exemptions-from-the-fee\/\" target=\"_blank\">two dozen ways<\/a> to get out of paying the Obamacare penalty: you earn less than the tax filing threshold, your cheapest plan costs more than 8% of your income, you were uninsured for less than three months, you filed for bankruptcy, or you had some other hardship.<\/p>\n<p>Altogether, the government estimates that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hhs.gov\/healthcare\/facts\/factsheets\/2015\/01\/health-coverage-federal-income-taxes.html\" target=\"_blank\">only 2% to 4% of taxpayers<\/a> will owe the fee. Another 10% to 20% are uninsured but are exempt from the penalty. Those taxpayers have two options:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pay the tax for 2014 and buy health coverage for 2015 during the special enrollment period, which has the added benefit of getting you out of the penalty next year.<\/li>\n<li>Claim an exemption from the tax for 2014 and go without health insurance again in 2015 (and potentially face the tax again next year).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&#8220;The taxpayer needs to make a choice,&#8221; says Tara Straw, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. &#8220;It would seem a no-brainer, a week ago, that you would claim an exemption if you were eligible for it. But now, there really should be a discussion about whether it&rsquo;s better to take the exemption someone is eligible for, or pay a penalty and have a special enrollment period.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3723900\"><\/div>\n<h3>The Potential Penalty<\/h3>\n<p>The penalty for being uninsured for all of 2014 is either $95 per person in your family (capped at $285), or 1% of your income (capped at the price of the average premiums for a bronze plan), whichever is higher.<\/p>\n<p>H&amp;R Block has found that so far, the <a href=\"http:\/\/newsroom.hrblock.com\/hr-block-taxpayers-following-aca-rules-refunds-take-hit\/\" target=\"_blank\">average Obamacare penalty for its clients is $172<\/a>, decreasing the average refund by 5%.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s definitely a significant amount of money for people who might be low-income and might have a lot of plans and expectations for what they might do with the tax refund,&#8221; Straw says. &#8220;But we need to weigh that against the fact that the penalty next year is much higher.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, the penalty will be either $325 per person in your family (capped at $975), or 2% of your income (capped at the price of the national average premium for a bronze plan in 2015&mdash;to be determined), whichever is higher.<\/p>\n<h3>The Bottom Line<\/h3>\n<p>Are you faced with this choice? Keep in mind that health insurance may be less expensive than you think. If your income is less than 400% of the federal poverty level&mdash;<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">$95,400<\/span> for a family of four in 2015&mdash;you&#8217;ll likely qualify for a subsidized premium.<\/p>\n<p>HHS found that <a href=\"http:\/\/aspe.hhs.gov\/health\/reports\/2014\/Premiums\/2014MktPlacePremBrf.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">87% of the people<\/a> who bought an Obamacare plan qualified for this tax credit, bring the price of health insurance down to an average of just $82 a month. Use the Kaiser Family Foundation&#8217;s calculator to <a href=\"http:\/\/kff.org\/interactive\/subsidy-calculator\/\" target=\"_blank\">get an estimate of your costs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your income is less than 133% of the poverty line&mdash;$15,654 for a single person in 2015, $32,253 for a family of four&mdash;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthcare.gov\/medicaid-chip\/medicaid-expansion-and-you\/\" target=\"_blank\">you could qualify for Medicaid<\/a>. You can sign up for Medicaid any time during the year, Straw says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that some people might be put in this position, but at the end of the day, if someone can enroll in coverage and avoid paying a penalty for 2015, that&rsquo;s still a good deal,&#8221; Straw says.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\" data-pos=\"5\" data-continuous=\"1\"><object

The ranks of the long-term unemployed, which ballooned during the recession as mature workers lost their jobs, are coming down. Age-discrimination charges have fallen for six consecutive years. And now, as the job market lurches back to life, more companies are wooing the silver set with formal retraining programs.<\/p>\n<p>This is not to say that older workers have it easy. Overall, the long-term unemployment rate remains <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.t12.htm\">stubbornly high<\/a>&mdash;31.5%. And even though age-discrimination <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3707549\/age-discrimination-employment\/\">charges have declined<\/a> they remain at peak pre-recession levels. Meanwhile, critics note that some corporate re-entry programs are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/id\/101106382#.\">not a great deal<\/a>, paying little or no salary and distracting workers from seeking full-time gainful employment.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the big picture is one of improving opportunity for workers past age 50. That&rsquo;s welcome news for many reasons, not least is that those who lose their job past age 58 are at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/mlr\/2014\/beyond-bls\/what-happens-when-older-workers-experience-unemployment.htm\">greater health risk<\/a> and, on average, lose three years of life expectancy. Meanwhile, older workers are a bigger piece of the labor force. Two decades ago, less than a third of people age 55 and over were employed or looking for work. Today, the share is 40%, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.<\/p>\n<p>AARP and others have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aarp.org\/work\/job-hunting\/info-07-2013\/older-workers-more-valuable.html\">long argued<\/a> that older workers are reliable, flexible, experienced and possess valuable institutional knowledge. Increasingly, employers seem to want these traits.<\/p>\n<p>This spring, the global bank Barclays will expand its apprenticeship program and begin <a href=\"http:\/\/realbusiness.co.uk\/article\/29208-barclays-shifts-perception-by-rolling-out-apprenticeship-scheme-for-those-over-50\">looking at candidates<\/a> past age 50. The bank will consider mature workers from unrelated fields, saying the only experience they need is practical experience. The bank says this is no PR stunt; it values older workers who have life experience and can better relate to customers seeking a mortgage or auto loan. With training, the bank believes they would make good, full-time, fairly compensated loan officers.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3725034\"><\/div>\n<p>Already, Barclays has a team of tech-savvy older workers in place to help mature customers with online banking. The new apprenticeship program builds on this effort to capitalize on the life skills of experienced employees.<\/p>\n<p>Others have tiptoed into this space. Goldman Sachs started a &ldquo;returnship&rdquo; in the throes of the recession. But the program is only a 10-week retraining exercise, with competitive pay, and highly selective. About 2% of applicants get accepted. It is not designed as a gateway to full-time employment at Goldman, though some older interns end up with job offers at the bank.<\/p>\n<p>The nonprofit Encore.com offers mature workers a one-year <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2013\/09\/work-forever-why-interning-at-60-is-the-new-retirement-plan\/279381\/\">fellowship<\/a>, typically in a professional capacity at another nonprofit, to help mature workers re-enter the job market. Again, this is a temporary arrangement and pays just $25,000.<\/p>\n<p>But a growing number of organizations&mdash;the National Institutes of Health, Stanley Consultants, and Michelin North America, among <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aarp.org\/work\/on-the-job\/info-06-2013\/aarp-best-employers-winners-2013.html\">many others<\/a>&mdash;embrace a seasoned workforce and have programs designed to attract and keep workers past 50. Companies with internship programs for older workers include PwC, Regeneron, Harvard Business School, MetLife and McKinsey.

You might want to take your funds to a credit union.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A survey released Thursday by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/finance\/checking\/want-free-checking-check-out-credit-unions-1.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Bankrate.com<\/a> found that 72% of America&#8217;s largest credit unions still offer standalone free checking accounts. And another 26% waive fees if customers meet certain requirements, like accepting e-statements or opting for direct deposit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Credit unions look ever more attractive compared to the nations biggest retail banks&mdash;only 38% of which now offer free checking, down from 65% five years ago.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even when credit unions <em>do<\/em> levy checking fees, those charges are typically between $2 and $3, about half of what traditional banks will deduct.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Prone to overdrawing your checking account? You&#8217;d do better at a credit union on that count, too. <span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">The average overdraft fee at unions is $26.78; the average for banks: $32.74. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In spite of the potential savings, however, a credit union isn&#8217;t right for everyone. Find out if you could benefit from becoming a member by checking our <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3546816\/how-to-find-a-credit-union\/\" target=\"_blank\">guide<\/a>.

Master the meeting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The average pay bump from a promotion is about 7%, though it can be even more once you&#8217;re a manager, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mercer.com\/content\/dam\/mercer\/attachments\/global\/Talent\/Compensation_Planning_Survey_ExecSumm14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Mercer<\/a>. But how do you get one?<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The meeting room is where we exert leadership and develop credibility,&rdquo; says corporate trainer Dana Brownlee of Professionalism Matters. Don&rsquo;t dominate&mdash;nudge the group toward concrete goals. If someone can&rsquo;t let go of a point, try saying, &ldquo;Good idea! I&rsquo;m writing it down.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve now freed a room of grateful co-workers to move on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Lend a hand at work<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has shown that successful people do more favors at work, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for tiny favors too. We may actually feel more warmly toward people after lending <em>them<\/em> a hand&mdash;our brains figure we must have done so because we like that person. It&rsquo;s been called the Benjamin Franklin effect: The Founding Father recalled winning over a legislative rival after borrowing a book from him.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our attitudes often follow our behavior instead of vice versa,&rdquo; says David McRaney, who writes about such psychological quirks in his book<em> You Are Now Less Dumb<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Learn a language<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">It&rsquo;s easier than ever to dip a toe into languages with free tools like Duolingo, a site and app that make learning like a game. If you then want to ramp things up, real-world classes run about $300 for 20 hours of instruction.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Invest your time and money wisely: The payoff is in less commonly studied languages. A Wharton\/LECG Europe study found that speaking <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/137042\/foreign-language-fluency-pay-salary\/\" target=\"_blank\">German<\/a> translated into a higher wage premium than for second languages overall. Ambitious? There&rsquo;s a big market for Mandarin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Get techy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Computer-science grads earn $700,000 over the average B.A. holder in a career, but those with English and psych degrees aren&rsquo;t out of luck: There are ways to use technology smarter&mdash;and get recognized for it&mdash;at all levels.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">For example, if there&rsquo;s any need to quantify your business&rsquo;s activity, being the office Excel guru makes you valuable. Two skills to focus on: building charts (great for presentations) and pivot tables (to summarize lots of data). The ExcelIsFun YouTube <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ExcelIsFun\" target=\"_blank\">channel<\/a> is loaded with lessons.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Want to compete with true techies? Codecademy.com can get you started for free learning code for building websites. Expertise in Ruby on Rails&mdash;certification testing is $150&mdash;snags an average salary of $110,000, says data crunched by qz.com.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">If all this sounds like too much work, at least Google better. Seriously. Say, for example, you need stats about a product&rsquo;s market share: Use &ldquo;OR&rdquo; (in caps) to Google for different words that might capture the same thing (like &ldquo;percent&rdquo; and &ldquo;proportion&rdquo;). And check the image search results: The data you need may be in a chart someone has posted. Go to Google&#8217;s <a href=\"support.google.com\/websearch\" target=\"_blank\">help center<\/a> for more power tips.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Write better<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A clear, unfussy writing style will get your ideas heard at work. (HR pros ranked writing second, behind only computer aptitude, among skills applicants most often lacked.) Harvard professor Steven Pinker, author of the new book <em>The Sense of Style<\/em>, gave us these tips for better writing:<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3726815\"><\/div>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong><em>Avoid fancy words you don&rsquo;t need or understand.<\/em> <\/strong>&ldquo;Fulsome&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;fulsome praise&rdquo;) does not mean full; it means insincere. If you use hoity-toity words to sound posh, you will look pompous and may say the opposite of what you mean.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong><em>Cut unnecessary words.<\/em> <\/strong>John Kerry once said, &ldquo;The President is desirous of trying to see how we can make our efforts in order to find a way to facilitate.&rdquo; What he meant was, &ldquo;The President wants to help.&rdquo; Much better.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong><em>Revise.<\/em><\/strong> And better still, show it to someone. What&rsquo;s clear to you may not be clear to someone else.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Learn social savvy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">If you run a business or work in marketing, social media like Twitter seem like a great way to get your message out. But remember that users have zero interest in following companies that clutter their feed with ads. Use social to establish your expertise or spark ideas; then when people are in the market for what you sell, they&rsquo;ll remember you.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Hannah Morgan, co-author of <em>Social Networking for Business Success<\/em>, explains that a good tweet is self-contained and has a discrete piece of information worth sharing. What works well is language like, &#8220;Baking cookies? Add eggs one at a time so you can mix in evenly. For more tips check out our Baking 101 guide.&#8221; Then add a link.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">A less effective tweet is something like, &#8220;We&#8217;re having a sale on tins of our delicious chocolate chip cookies. $19.99 all day Friday&#8221; because it reads like an advertisement and is therefore is unlikely to be shared.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\"><strong>7. Take back your workday<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you get paid a flat salary, turning a 10-hour day into nine more-productive hours is like giving yourself an 11% hourly raise.<\/p>\n<p>Try three key moves from former Fidelity president Bob Pozen, author of <em>Extreme Productivity<\/em>: First, handle each email just once. Reply, file, or trash&mdash;don&rsquo;t come back to it later.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Second, hide that extra chair; you&rsquo;ll discourage chatty co-workers from lingering. Finally, you might want to consider timing your breaks, since research shows your brain loses focus on a task after about 90 minutes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Sell yourself<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">&ldquo;Ten years ago job seekers would write a full-page cover letter,&rdquo; says executive r&eacute;sum&eacute; writer Wendy Enelow. A better approach now is an email designed to cut through the electronic clutter.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Use the subject line to note your key selling points. Instead of &ldquo;Director of sales position,&rdquo; write &ldquo;Director of Sales&mdash;10 Years of Exceeding Sales Quotas&mdash;MBA.&rdquo; In the body of the email, spotlight a major accomplishment. Follow up with three big career wins in bullet points.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Learn to DIY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Some jobs always require a professional but, with a little prep, tasks like painting a room or replacing your car&#8217;s air filters can be a piece of cake&mdash;and save you a solid amount of money. <span class=\"Normal__Char\">A painting<\/span> pro, for example, could easily charge $1,600 for a big job, vs. up to $400 in materials on your own.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Normal\">Rich O&rsquo;Neil of Masterwork Painting &amp; Restoration in Woburn, Mass., explains that to get professional results you must dust surfaces and tape up edges and moldings you don&rsquo;t want painted. Painting should go in two types of strokes: First apply a thin layer for coverage. Then paint over it to even and smooth.<\/p>\n<p>You can replace your car&#8217;s air filters yourself every 12,000 miles on newer cars. You&rsquo;ll save about $50 in labor costs, says Mike Forsythe of Haynes, an auto-repair guidebook publisher, and pay 25% less for the filter by getting it at a parts store. To change an engine filter, check the housing in the engine compartment; in most cars there&rsquo;s a cover you can unlatch with your fingers. You&rsquo;ll typically find the cabin filter inside the car, behind the glove box.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Get organized<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Everyone hates paying a late fee just because of a forgotten reminder to pay a bill on time. And few tasks are as irritating as foraging for receipts from months and months ago.<\/p>\n<p>The key to never losing track of important papers is to keep just one bin and make sure to empty your pockets and purse into it every night. Then set a regular date on your calendar to empty the bin and organize the receipts. &ldquo;If you wait too long, you may not even remember your purchase,&rdquo; says professional organizer Andrew Mellen.<\/p>\n<p>If you find it hard to even check your calendar on a routine basis, pair a daily check with your morning coffee&mdash;or any other routine you already have.<\/p><aside

href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3708117\/financial-fitness\/\" target=\"_blank\">Total Financial Fitness<\/a>, we&#8217;ve developed six quick workouts, inspired by the popular exercise plan that takes just seven minutes a day. Each will help kick your finances into shape in no time at all. Today: The 7-Minute Cell Plan<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Dread getting your monthly cell phone bill? There&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re paying for too much data. According to the CTIA-Wireless Association, smartphone users consume an average of 800 MB of data per month&mdash;less than the 1GB or larger plans pushed by most cell providers. Here&#8217;s how to find out how much you actually need.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>0:00:<\/strong> Surf to your wireless provider&#8217;s site and log into your account. Look for a tab or section that displays your usage summary. For example, Verizon has a &ldquo;View My Usage&rdquo; tab on the left side of the page. Click it, and you&rsquo;ll see an overview of how many minutes you spent on the phone, how much data you consumed, and how many messages you sent per billing cycle. Print out the totals from three or four months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2:13:<\/strong> Visit <span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.whistleout.com\" target=\"_blank\">whistleout.com<\/a>, a site where you can compare various cell plans. The site will prompt you to<\/span> enter the number of lines you have and select a type of phone. If you&#8217;re not in the market for a new handset, choose the &ldquo;BYO Phone&rdquo; option.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>2:30:<\/strong> Now, grab those usage printouts. Use the sliders in the center of the screen to fill out the largest amount of minutes, data, and texts you used during a single billing cycle. Next, you&#8217;ll click through a series of drop-down menus to specify whether you require full-speed data at all times, want a monthly or contract plan, and which provider you use. Click &ldquo;Compare Cell Plans.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3717569\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>3:15: <\/strong>WhistleOut will show you a range of cell plans that fit your needs, starting with the cheapest.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>4:52<\/strong>: Of course, if you&#8217;re thinking of switching carriers, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure the firm offers adequate coverage where you live and work. Go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rootmetrics.com\/us\" target=\"_blank\">Rootmetrics.com<\/a>, a site that lists coverage maps and quality ratings for the major four wireless carriers and dozens of smaller ones. For local details, search for your metropolitan area.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>5:45:<\/strong> Now you have all the information you need to switch to the right plan. Going with a new carrier? Give them a call to sign up. Or, if you want to stick with the same company (or must stick with them, thanks to your contract), have them downsize your plan or point out that a competitor is offering a better plan and request a discount.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Previous 7-minute Workouts:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/money\/3712095\/get-credit-report-score-fast\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Easiest
