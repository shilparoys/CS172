             <p class="intro">"My Gap year experience was everything I thought it would be and more. I loved Green River Community College! I really had a nice, calm and fun experience in Auburn where I really stepped out of my comfort zone. My English improved a lot and I felt more and more confident with speaking English every day and I also became more confident about meeting new people. I made a lot of friends in Auburn that will be my friends for life.</p> 
             <p>"My Hawaii experience and my time at Kapi'olani Community College was also all that I thought it would be - a beautiful campus, perfect weather and many things to do! And the teachers, my classmates and all the people I met really had the Aloha-spirit. To be able to sit on the beach and do homework was a dream come true.</p> 
             <p>"To be able to study at two different places in America was so much fun! And to be able to study different classes to figure out what I want to do and what I enjoy in my life was a really good experience for me! I got to try a lot of different and fun things that I probably never would have tried in my country.</p> 
             <p>"All the teachers and advisors I have come in contact with during my year abroad have really been super helpful. The support from them, my family and all the new friends that I met made this study abroad year the best year of my life." </p>

             <p>"I had to pay for this myself. I worked for almost five months, full-time as a salesman trying to get the money I needed. After those five months, I had enough money to go for one quarter.</p> 
             <p>"After Green River, I will be attending Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and majoring in International Business. Four hundred students apply for only 150 spots. Half go to domestic students and half go to international students. However, because I attended Green River and received an international education for one quarter, I have already been guaranteed admission into VU University Amsterdam. </p> 
             <p>"If I had this to do all over again, I wouldn't change a thing. I would do everything the exact same way. I would tell my friends you just have to go. This is something you have to experience to see how awesome it is."</p>

             <p>"My agency in the Netherlands told me that that they had only heard good things about this college and the students are really well taken care of. In addition, this was the only college I could attend at 17 and live in <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/campus-life/student-housing.htm" title="Campus Corner Apartments" target="_blank">student housing</a> instead of a host family. I was ready for some independence.</p> 
             <p>"I also wanted to travel and see the world. Coming to Green River Community College in Washington State was my first step in my world travels. I have made life-long friends from many different countries.</p> 
             <p>"Gap year really helped me to make the necessary step between high school and university. I didn't know what I wanted to study when I was in the Netherlands and the American system let me explore my interests. I have grown to really like the American education system because you can pursue your major and study other areas. For example, you can major in history and study psychology too. There are also a lot of clubs and activities that you can get involved in. If the club does not exist, you can create it. In fact, I helped to create the fist European club on campus. It's a wholistic education. </p> 
             <p>"This fall, I will be attending <a href="http://www.ucr.nl/Pages/default.aspx" title="Roosevelt Academy" target="_blank">Roosevelt Academy </a> in Middleburg. I am grateful to Green River Community College for opening my eyes to the importance of a liberal arts education. I am excited about my future and plan to major in History."</p>

He also enjoyed working on campus as an International Student Ambassador. &#x201d;I helped organize soccer tournaments for students and trips to professional soccer, football, baseball games, and skiing trips to Whistler, B.C.&#x201d;</p> 
             <p>He liked the atmosphere at Green River. &#x201c;I met students from many different parts of the world. It is very different from my school in Germany where there are only a few international students.&#x201d;</p> 
             <p>What Philipp liked most about studying at Santa Barbara Community College is the location. The college is very close to the beach. "With the nice weather, you can only be in a good mood," said Philipp.</p> 
             <p>"I think the Gap Year program is perfect, because you can improve your English, you learn to live two different American lifestyles, and you also make new friends from all over the world...this Gap Year is a lot of fun and if apply you will not regret your decision!"</p>

			<p><b>Coen Van Woerkom - Abcoude, The Netherlands </b><br>
			Major: Economics</p>
			<p>&quot;Because of the Dutch educational system, I was going to graduate 
			from high school at quite a young age. Therefore, I decided that it 
			would be good for me to study abroad for a year. The United States have 
			always been very appealing to me, so it didnÂt take me long to decide 
			I wanted to go there. That left the choice of where to go in the US. 
			With the help of an agency (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.interlanguage.nl/nl/reis/college/land/plaats/grcc/accommodatietype/accommodatie/studie/activeTab=College/">Interlanguage</a>) I eventually settled on GRCC. 
			GRCC seemed, and has proven to be by now, the best choice for me. It 
			was not too big, it was in a small city but near a big city, and it 
			has a serious study environment; all things I like. </p>
			<p>Although not everything was always easy - missing friends, family, 
			culture, and food - overall it was absolutely worth it. IÂve met amazing 
			people, IÂve had awesome classes, classes I would never be able to take 
			back home, and IÂve seen some of AmericaÂs beautiful landscapes and 
			cultures. </p>
			<p>To all the people that are thinking about studying in the US, I would 
			say: do it! It is a very interesting experience, and I think that GRCC 
			would be a great location for that experience. Not only because of the 
			good location and study environment, but also because of the many other 
			international students that share your problems and joys.&quot; </p>

            <div class="text"> 
             <p><b>Remco Zwetsloot - Amsterdam, The Netherlands </b><br> Major: International Relations</p> 
             <p>It's been almost two years since I graduated from Green River Â enough time to realize the immense impact studying in the U.S. has had on me, both personally and academically. When I first arrived at Sea-Tac, I was a rather shy kid unsure of what exactly I wanted from life. When I flew back to Europe two years later, I was a confident guy with too many dreams to realize in a single lifetime.</p> 
             <p>My name is Remco Zwetsloot, 20 years old, and I am currently a student at University College Roosevelt in Middelburg, the Netherlands. I did the medium level of high school, called "havo," in the Netherlands before going to Green River for a gap year. Within three months, however, I realized I wanted to stay in America as long as possible: I was on the cross country team and had a great group of friends, fun classes, and a job on The Current, the college newspaper Â I had never been happier.</p> 
             <p>I decided to stay for another year and get my Associate's degree. Life got even better (and a lot busier) when I was selected to be Editor-in-Chief of The Current and started tutoring IESL students. Unfortunately, despite the jobs, I had run out of money by the time I graduated, and I had to return to the Netherlands. There, having become convinced of the superiority of the American liberal arts model of education, I enrolled at UCR, an international honors college of Utrecht University which employs the same model as Green River and other American universities.</p> 
             <p>There, I have since become actively involved in several student clubs. This year I was elected chairman of the Academic Affairs Council, a position which involves working with the university administration on all matters relating to academics. Last year I was offered a scholarship by The Fund for American Studies to spend a summer in Washington, D.C., enrolled at Georgetown University and doing an internship for a U.S. Senator.</p> 
             <p>None of this would have been possible without Green River. Not only did my Associate's degree allow me to enroll at UCR (normally Dutch students can only enroll at universities after completing the highest level of high school, VWO), but my two years at GRCC also taught me everything I needed to be successful here. I had learned the value of student life and getting involved. I had gained the academic skills that allow me to be a successful student. I had acquired the writing skills and built up the rÃ©sumÃ© that helped me get my TFAS scholarship. I had grown into a confident person who easily makes friends.</p> 
             <p>Looking back on the two years at Green River, I don't think I could have spent them any better. They certainly made a rather sizeable dent in my (and my parents') bank account, but, in terms of life experience, they definitely made me as rich as I could have been.</p>

			<p>&quot; I heard about GRCC&#39;s High School Completion program through EF. 
			I thought that it was the perfect program for me because I wanted to 
			go to university in America and I needed to complete high school. The 
			program saved me time and I got a high school diploma as well. Moreover, 
			at GRCC many students transfer to very high ranking Universities. I 
			became one of them. I am pursuing my dream at UCLA in the field of Computer 
			Science. I really appreciate GRCC and the High School Completion program.

			<p>&quot;GRCC was a remarkable transition for me. The faculty and advisors 
			are all compassionate, encouraging, and dedicated to helping students 
			excel academically. GRCC gave me a positive college experience through 
			its plentiful services and opportunities. In the High School Plus program, 
			most of my classes were double-counted for college and high school credits, 
			making completion of an associate degree and high school diploma accessible 
			within a timeframe of two years. &quot;</p>
