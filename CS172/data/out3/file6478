Chargeback forms allow Camden County College to bill other counties for additional costs incurred in educating out of county students. Click <a href="http://www.camdencc.edu/registration/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;PageID=12807">here</a> for specific instructions regarding chargeback. <br> <br> <strong>How much does it cost per credit? </strong><br> Tuition is currently $107 per credit for Camden County residents, $111 per credit for Out of County and Out of State residents, and $199 per credit for international students. In addition, there are mandatory fees applicable to all students, including a $30 per credit general service fee, $7 per credit facilities fee, course fees, and hourly instruction fees associated with specific courses. <strong>Tuition and fees are subject to change without notice. </strong><br> <br> <strong>What is the "General Service" fee?</strong><br> The general service fee is $30 per credit. This fee covers your student I.D., parking decal, use of the library, open access computer labs and other general college services.&nbsp; Also, an ever-increasing portion of this fee is dedicated towards building and improving our technology infrastructure. It is important that we not only keep pace with technology, but also expand upon it. <br> <br> <strong>What is the "Facility" fee?</strong><br> The facility fee is $7 per credit. This fee is applied toward the construction of new facilities on campus. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>What is the "Course" fee?</strong><br> Course fees are charged to help support materials and equipment utilized in some classes.&nbsp; These fees are not charged in all courses and vary when they are charged.&nbsp; Course fees are listed in the schedule of classes for each term. <br> <br> <strong>What is the "Hourly Instruction" fee?</strong><br> The hourly instruction fee helps to support the additional classroom instruction that is a part of certain courses<strong> <br> </strong><br> <br> <strong>How do I get a refund?</strong><br> The Business Office issues refunds according to the following policy:<br> 100%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refund for <strong>official </strong>drops processed <strong>prior to</strong> the start of the term.<br> 50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refund for <strong>officia</strong>l drops processed <strong>during the drop/add period</strong>.<br> 0%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refund for withdrawals processed <strong>after the drop/add period or for non-attendance</strong>.<br> <br> Late fees (if charged) are non-refundable. <br> You must contact the Business Office to request a refund, unless the refund is a result of Financial Aid funds. <br> Financial Aid refunds are automatically processed and mailed to the students. Please allow two weeks for processing refunds once the funds are transmitted onto your account.&nbsp; Refund checks are generally mailed during the third week in October for the fall semester, and during the third week in March for the spring semester.<br> <br> <strong>Please Note:</strong> No refunds will be issued for drops processed after the deadlines. After the deadline, students who do not wish to remain enrolled in a course MUST withdraw from the course. A withdrawal form must be completed and submitted to the Office of Admissions and Registration Services by the withdrawal deadlines. Failure to do this may result in a failure grade.<br> <br> <strong>What happens if I have a past due balance?</strong> <br> <br> <strong>You will not be able to access your grades, transcripts, or register for classes.</strong> The College requires that all prior balances be paid in full before registering for a subsequent semester. Once you have paid your prior balances, you may need to notify the Business Office in order to be permitted to register. Payments made will be applied to prior balances first. Please contact a supervisor in the business office to make payment arrangements. If your bill remains unpaid for a period of time, your account will be forwarded to a collection agency and you will be responsible to pay in full the past due balance and any collection and/or attorney’s fees that may be incurred by or on behalf of CCC to satisfy your financial obligations.<br> <strong><br> <strong>How can I get a copy of my 1098T (tax) form?</strong></strong> <br>

You need to place this code in step #6 of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a>). <br> <br> <strong>What are the hours that the Financial Aid Office is open?</strong><br> Regular academic year hours for the Financial Aid office are outlined below.<br> <strong>Blackwood campus:</strong> Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. <br> <strong>Camden campus:</strong> Monday through Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Friday 8:30 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.<br> ** Summer hours are reduced on Fridays to 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p. m.<br> <br> <strong>What is the deadline for applying for financial aid?</strong><br> The&nbsp; Financial Aid priority filing deadline for the fall semester is May 1 and September 1 for the spring semester.&nbsp; After filing the FAFSA, all documentation must be submitted by June 1 for a fall semester and October 1 for a spring semester, in order to be considered for all available types of aid.&nbsp; Priority applications will be processed prior to the start of the semester.&nbsp; However, as long as you complete your application before the last day of the semester or your last day of attendance (whichever comes first), we will review your eligibility.<br> <br> <strong>What is a “complete” file?</strong><br> For a file to be complete, you must have had your <u>FAFSA</u> processed by the Department of Education and the results received by the College. You must also have submitted the College's <u>Authorization and Certification</u> form and any <u>verification documentation</u> as required by the US Department of Education, NJ HESAA, or CCC. You also must have been accepted into an eligible degree or certificate program in order for your application to be considered complete. <br> <br> <strong>What happens next?</strong><br> Approximately 3 to 4 weeks after you have completed your FAFSA, you should receive your Student Aid Report (also known as the SAR) from the Department of Education. The school receives the same information electronically. We will inform you of the status of your application and tell you if we need any additional documentation. Once your file is complete, if you are eligible for aid you should receive an award letter within 2 to 4 weeks.<br> <br> <strong>How do I go about buying books for my classes?</strong><br> If you have been awarded by the College's Financial Aid Office <strong>and</strong> you have pre-registered for the semester <strong>and</strong> you have a credit balance, you may report to the Bookstore the week before classes begin and you will be able to charge books and supplies against your financial aid award. Otherwise financial aid students seeking bookstore purchasing authorization would need to come in to the Financial Aid Office.&nbsp; If you qualify, &nbsp;bookstore authorization will be supplied electronically to the bookstore on your behalf. With a valid College ID card and proof of registration, the bookstore will set up an account for you. What you spend in the bookstore will be deducted from your award after tuition and fees and before refunds are issued. <br> <br> <strong>If I have applied for a student loan will my bill be covered? </strong><br> If the Financial Aid Office has received all documents required to process your loan application, and you qualify for a sufficient amount to cover tuition and fee costs, your payment&nbsp; will be deferred until your loan funds are disbursed to the college.&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>Can I get credit in the bookstore with a student loan?</strong><br> If you applied for a loan prior to the start of classes for the term and you have funds remaining after tuition and fee costs are considered, bookstore authorization will be supplied electronically to the bookstore on your behalf. With a valid College ID card and proof of registration, the bookstore will set up an account for you. What you spend in the bookstore will be deducted from your loan proceeds after tuition and fees and before refunds are issued. <br> <br> <strong>I would like to register under the Unemployed Persons' Tuition Waiver program or the National Guard Tuition Waiver program?</strong><br> Before registering, bring to the Financial Aid Office a letter from your Commander (National Guard) or a NJ Job Service certification form (unemployed).&nbsp;&nbsp; The College must also have the results of your FAFSA on file or you must submit proof that you have filed the <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a> form.&nbsp; Waiver applications and policies are available <a href="http://www.camdencc.edu/financialaid/finaideforms.cfm" target="_blank">here</a> .&nbsp; Please refer to the specific <a href="http://www.camdencc.edu/registration/acadcal.htm">semester calendar</a> for registration dates. <br> <br> <strong>Does financial aid cover non-credit courses? </strong><br> No, financial aid <strong>does not</strong> cover non-credit courses, however you may apply for a private loan or VA assistance if eligible. Contact Continuing Education at (856) 374-4955 for more details.<br> <br> <strong>Who needs to provide parent information to apply for financial aid?</strong><br> It depends on your answers to the questions in Step 3 of the 2010-11 FAFSA.&nbsp; Generally, anyone born in 1987 or after, who is not married or not orphaned needs to provide his or her parents information. You are exempt, however, if you are a veteran, a ward of the court or you have dependents for which you provide more than 50% support. See the detailed instructions at <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/</a> .<br> <br> <strong>Are there any other qualifications for receiving aid?</strong><br> Yes, the following criteria must be met before you can receive financial aid: <br> 1. You must meet the College's admission policies and be accepted into an eligible degree or certificate program.<br> 2. You must be a United States citizen or eligible non-citizen.<br> 3.
