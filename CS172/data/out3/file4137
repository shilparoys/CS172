     <h1>Who We Are</h1> 
     <p>The Westmont Worship Team is a group of young adults committed to encouraging worship on campus and in the global church. Although we serve most visibly through musical leadership in Chapel, we also seek to build community through prayer, discipleship, and fellowship. </p> 
     <p>Our desire is to bring glory to God through our music, studies and relationships, in order that the name of Jesus would be made famous on campus and beyond.</p> 
     <h1>Joining the Worship Team </h1> 
     <p>Below are requirements for serving on the Worship Team. Please contact<a href="mailto:jopatter@westmont.edu"> Joel Patterson </a>with any questions. </p> 
     <h3>Orientation Week</h3> 
     <p>The entire Worship Team is required to attend a week-long orientation during the week before school begins.<u> </u><em>If you are an RA, you are not eligible for worship team since RA orientation happens during the same week</em>. <br> </p> 
     <h3>Weekly Practice</h3> 
     <p>Practices will be in the Kerr Student Center. All worship team members are expected to arrive on time. No worship team member will be allowed to schedule a class (or work) during this time.</p> 
     <p>Vocal Rehearsal: Monday nights from 6:45pm to 7:55pm</p> 
     <p>Full Band Rehearsal: Monday nights from 8:00pm – 9:15pm</p> 
     <h3> Meetings</h3> 
     <p>All worship team members will attend a mandatory monthly meeting to pray, worship and fellowship together. These meetings will usually be off-campus and will last the entire evening. Locations and times will change from month to month.<br> </p> 
     <h3>Year-Long Commitment</h3> 
     <p>All worship team members are expected to serve for an entire year (two semesters) for their first year on the Team. After serving a full year, it is permissible to study abroad for a semester or two and then return to the Team. </p> 
     <h3>Practice Materials</h3> 
     <p>Rehearsal materials in the form of audio recordings, chord charts and lead sheets will be distributed to all worship team members. All songs must be learned during the Summer <em>before</em> Orientation Week. Here are some details:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Vocalists are responsible for memorizing all your parts exactly as they are on the CD. Once you master your parts, you are free to embellish and create. </li> 
      <li> Bassists are responsible for learning all bass lines, all fills, etc. </li> 
      <li>Drummers are required to buy a metronome and headphones at the start of the Summer. Drummers must be able to play all songs to a metronome.</li> 
      <li>Acoustic guitarists are responsible for learning all acoustic lines in all songs, utilizing capos, and fingerpicking if necessary. </li> 
      <li><u>Electric guitarists are r</u>esponsible for learning all electric parts in all songs, mimicking feel and sound of original recording whenever possible. Once you master your parts, you may embellish and create.</li> 
      <li>Percussionists will learn all percussion patterns as they occur on the Rehearsal CD’s. If songs on rehearsal CD’s don’t have percussion parts, it is your responsibility to come up with a simple, tasteful and appropriate part.</li> 
      <li>Keyboardists must be able to play piano and must be willing to try other sounds such as B3 Organ and Rhoads to create atmosphere, mood, etc. If songs on rehearsal CD’s don’t have keyboard lines, it is your responsibility to come up with a simple, tasteful and appropriate part.</li> 
      <li><u>All other instruments, please s</u>ee <a href="mailto:jopatter@westmont.edu">Joel Patterson</a> for details.</li> 
     </ul> 
     <h3>Fellowship</h3> 
     <p>If you serve on the Worship Team, expect to reach out to each other in friendship. I’m not asking that you make worship team your only group of friends—but the team should be a high priority. </p> 
     <h3>Prayer</h3> 
     <p>We believe that nothing good comes without prayer. No amount of planning, musical excellence, money, personnel or resources will do any good without God's blessing. Thus, we will have regular scheduled times of prayer as a team.</p> 
     <h3>Fun</h3> 
     <p>Having fun is serious business! Since we’ll be spending a lot of time working it’s only natural that we also goof off. Night games, movies, dinners, frisbee games, etc… these things are essential to keeping a good perspective. If you want to serve on this team, expect to have fun.<br> </p> 
     <h3>Musical Excellence</h3> 
     <p>I expect a very high degree of musical excellence from the Worship Team. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned musician, expect to be stretched and challenged. </p> 
     <h3>Academic Excellence</h3> 
     <p>I expect all members to be in good academic standing. If you cannot keep your grades up, I may work with you to have you temporarily step down from leadership until you remedy the situation. </p> 
     <h3>Taking the High Road</h3> 
     <p>As campus leaders, I also expect all members to steer clear of any inappropriate behavior, including (but not limited to) underage drinking, partying, premarital sex, dishonesty, foul language, or anything else listed in the <a href="../../_student_life/student_handbook/community-life-statement.html">Westmont Community Life Statement</a>. </p> 
     <h3>Servanthood</h3> 
     <p><em>Expect to serve!</em> This ministry is best when done selflessly. </p> 
     <h3>Conflicts</h3> 
     <p>Busyness is an epidemic problem at Westmont! Stacking campus involvements on top of an already full life can result in spiritual and physical fatigue. </p> 
     <p><em>If you want to serve on Worship Team you must make it your #1 priority.</em></p> 
     <p>Organizations like:</p> 
     <ul>
      <li>Vespers</li> 
      <li>Spring Sing</li> 
      <li>WSM</li> 
      <li>Potter’s Clay</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>…or any other extra-curricular activities must be secondary to Worship team. If a practice conflicts, you are obligated to go to Worship Team practice. If a meeting conflicts, you are obligated to go to the Worship Team meeting. Why? I believe that committing to <em>one</em> activity is a way of safeguarding yourself against overwork and fatigue. </p> 
     <p>Don’t get me wrong—I think these other activities / ministries are wonderful things! But I would rather have you choose <u>one</u> of these and do it <em>with all your heart</em> than suffer from ministry overload.</p> 
     <p>Please prayerfully consider these expectations. Can you make the commitment?</p>
