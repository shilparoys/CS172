      <p>The importance of snow water storage in the mountains for summer-time irrigation and food production in downstream states is widely recognized. The process-based modeling of hydrologic systems, including snow processes, is an essential and cost effective tool for our resource management and risk analyses. Our goal is to establish a methodology to estimate snow accumulation, blowing snow, and snowmelt for enhanced water resource management at the watershed and regional scales. </p> 
      <p><strong>Dr. Ohara</strong>, the leader of this group, has been working on snow and watershed hydrology modeling for more than ten years through national and international research projects. A numerical algorithm for snowmelt and snow accumulation processes for very fine scale modeling (~10m grid resolution) was developed and applied to various watersheds around the world. The model solves the depth-averaged snow equations for snow depth, snow surface temperature, and snow density, with consideration of vegetation interception and terrain angles. His snow model is a part of an award-winning, Watershed Environmental Hydrology (WEHY) model system. </p> Dr. Ohara also performed a field experiment at the Ward Creek watershed, Tahoe Basin, California, for snow thermal and runoff processes within a snow-covered hillslope. We are currently conducting a similar field work in the Snowy Range, Wyoming, to quantify the overland/in-snow flow component on the hillslope in very cold climate conditions.

      He has been operating mesoscale numerical weather models such as MM5 &amp; WRF models, for downscaling synoptic scale atmospheric data. These models can reconstruct the regional scale atmospheric data based on NCEP reanalysis data, North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data, Global Forecast System (GFS) outputs and General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs. Recently, Ohara has contributed to the research activities for a new estimation methodology of the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) using the MM5 model. He uses high performance computing (HPC) resources at the University of Wyoming, including the NCAR-Wyoming Center (Yellowstone), the UW on-campus cluster (Mt. Moran), and the department cluster (Snowy). 
     <p>Dr. Ohara is actively involved in the Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG) EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 project, funded by NSF. He operates a weather station, hillslope runoff site, and several shallow aquifer monitoring sites in the Snowy Range, Wyoming.</p>
