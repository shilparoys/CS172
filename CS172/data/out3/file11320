      <h3>growth sector</h3> 
      <p>An understanding of Spanish is essential not only to maintain and improve our cultural and economic ties with the 20 countries where Spanish is the official language, but also to learn about and appreciate the culture of approximately <strong>50 million Hispanics living in the U.S.</strong></p> 
      <p>Occupations that serve broad U.S. populations—from <strong>health care to education to business and marketing</strong>—need Spanish speakers with strong, broad liberal arts skills.</p> 
      <p>We help you get <strong>internships where you can use your language skills</strong>, working with Spanish speakers in schools, hospitals or other organizations, here in the States or overseas. Employers like to see these kinds of practical experiences on résumés.</p>

                <p>This course introduces students to the basic critical skills for literary and cultural analysis, develops reading fluency across genres (such as poetry, prose, and theatre) and literary periods, and examines interdisciplinary cultural discourses as connected to a topic or topics related to the Hispanic world. Representative works and products studied are placed within their historical, cultural and theoretical contexts. The course pays particular attention to the development of oral and written argumentation across cultural frameworks and perspectives. Emphasis is placed on oral interpretations and presentations, critical oral and written responses, as well as on the original application of critical methodologies in written work. Students will develop writing and research skills pertinent to future coursework in the discipline. Topics may rotate among the following: Gender and Representation in Hispanic Literatures and Film; Spain, Latin America, the U.S.: An Odyssey of Cultures; Short Fictions in the Spanish Speaking World; The Hispanic Imagination: Poetry and Narrative; Identity, Performance and Self-Representation in Spanish-Speaking Cultures; The Hispanic Novella Tradition from Cervantes to Garcia Marquez.</p>

                <p>The Capstone is a summative experience of the skills and approaches acquired by an undergraduate student throughout the major in correspondence with National Standards. Conducted as an independent study, it will consist of three components: (1) An oral defense of an Honors Thesis or a revised research paper drawing on the work, content and methodologies from one of the Hispanic Studies Seminars regularly offered by the Spanish department, or from the work of an undefended Honors Thesis in Spanish. Students will complete revisions and any further research/expansion of the paper, and also prepare to present that research to peers and faculty members at the Spanish Department's Hispanic Studies Colloquium, a public forum showcasing the research of graduating Spanish majors. (2) Completion of an oral proficiency exam. (3) Completion of a writing proficiency exam.</p>

                <p>This course traces Hispanic cultural presence in North America through three key historical moments. Starting with Spain's colonial expansion and cultural imprint in North America, followed by the 1848 transition of these territories to the U.S. and resulting cultural production, the course then focuses on the migrations and political exiles of the late 19th and the 20th century, the civil rights movement, contestatory writing and the rise of ethnic literatures and films in both Spanish and English. Lastly, the course views recent works by first- or second-generation authors who write in English, but occupy a space of enunciation that is neither Hispanic nor Anglo, but fluid, hybrid, and multicultural.</p>

The course examines the concepts of cultural hybridity, contact and conflict, ethnicity and race, adaptation, and cultural/language contact. Course readings draw on a combination of historical analysis, ethnographic studies, autobiography, fiction, poetry, essays, and film in order explore the many manifestations of contact in these three unique contexts.</p>

                <p>This course is designed to offer an overview of Spanish theatre through representative works from the seventeenth century Golden Age to the early 20th century. Through an analysis of different dramatic genres the course explores the background and the historical, social and aesthetic development of the Spanish theatre, as well as its principal themes. We pay particular attention to these plays not just as literary artifacts, but also as texts for performance. In particular, we examine gender and sexuality both in performance and as performance - analyzing the meanings produced by gendered and sexualized bodies on stage and in audiences, as well as the constructions and manifestations of gender and sexuality through performance itself across different contexts and time periods.</p>
