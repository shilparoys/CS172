       <h2>College of Arts and Sciences</h2> 
       <p><strong>Paula Lutz, Dean<br>113 Arts and Sciences Building<br>Phone: (307) 766-4106, Fax: (307) 766-2697<br>Web site: <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/as">http://www.uwyo.edu/as</a></strong> </p> 
       <h3>Aims and Objectives</h3> 
       <p>The College of Arts and Sciences (A&amp;S) is committed to providing a balanced education that matches cultural breadth with disciplinary depth. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences learn to address complex contemporary problems and to place them in their wider social, historical and ethical contexts. To achieve these goals, degree programs require students to develop expertise in a particular field, gain critical understanding of major areas of human knowledge and select from required courses and free electives to prepare for the challenges of the new century. </p> 
       <p>A successful student in any of the departments and programs in the College of Arts and Sciences will have an excellent foundation for professional success, graduate study, and a passion for lifelong learning. </p> 
       <p>Through hands-on research and creative projects (either on faculty projects or independently with faculty guidance and mentoring), fieldwork, internships, and study abroad, students integrate and bring coherence to their classroom learning. </p> 
       <h3>Student Responsibilities</h3> 
       <p>To graduate from the College of Arts and Sciences, students must satisfy all university, college, and major requirements for a given degree. These requirements apply whether the work is taken within the college or transferred from anywhere else within or outside the university (please refer to section below "Acceptance of Transfer Work").</p> 
       <p>The college holds students responsible for knowing degree and major requirements and for completing the necessary courses. Students are also expected to know the regulations that govern the academic standards needed to continue study at the university. Students should be aware that changing majors and/or colleges may result in delays in meeting degree requirements and that requirements themselves sometimes change (see Graduation Requirements and Procedures section of this Catalog). </p> 
       <h3>Academic Advising</h3> 
       <p>To help plan a program of study, students are assigned an academic adviser by the department/program of their major.&nbsp; Students undecided about a major are advised in the UW Center for Advising and Career Services (222 Knight Hall).</p> 
       <p>Students should consult regularly with their academic adviser not only for course scheduling, but also to discuss educational and career goals.&nbsp; Faculty and professional advisers can link students to the many resources in the Division of Student Affairs to assist in researching options for undergraduate study and careers.&nbsp; Instructors are also willing to discuss concerns students may have regarding specific courses.</p> 
       <p>&nbsp;</p> 
       <h3>Changing/Declaring a Major or Minor</h3> 
       <p>When ready to declare a major, minor, or dual/concurrent major in a department or program in the college, the appropriate form is available from the <a href="http://uwadmnweb.uwyo.edu/REGISTRAR/forms.asp">Office of the Registrar's</a> web page.&nbsp; Approval is required from the appropriate department heads/program directors.&nbsp; Departments/programs will assign advisors at the time of signing their approval on the form.</p> 
       <h3>Programs of Study</h3> 
       <p><strong>Undergraduate Degrees<br></strong>A variety of specialized concentrations are offered within many of the following degree programs. Take a look at the department sections in this Catalog that follow this section or the departments' Web sites. Additionally, there are several inter-college or interdisciplinary degrees/majors such as Microbiology, Earth System Science, and the affiliated major in Environment and Natural Resources that draw courses from several disciplines. See more detailed descriptions in this Catalog or the University of Wyoming home page at www.uwyo.edu, click on the A-Z Directory.</p>

       <h3>Minors in Arts and Sciences</h3> 
       <p>The College of Arts and Sciences offers all university students systematic studies leading to recognized academic minors. Minors are available in all academic programs in the college and in a number of interdisciplinary areas. </p> 
       <p>A&amp;S minors have two aims: to encourage students to create a focus for their course work outside their major by coordinating their elective studies; and to enhance chances of employment or graduate admission with a formally recognized field of study.</p> 
       <p>Minors consist of course requirements ranging from 18-24 credit hours of study, typically including significant work at the junior and senior level. At least 12 credit hours in a minor must be from courses not being counted toward the student's major. A&amp;S departments and programs offering minors and interdisciplinary degrees may have further conditions and restrictions regarding requirements in the minor. To be counted toward a minor, courses must be completed with a grade of C or better.</p> 
       <p>Students desiring a minor must notify the department in which the minor is offered and the college dean's office. Forms for declaring a minor are available in the Office of the Registrar (167 Knight Hall) or on the Registrar's web page. The department of the minor will assign an adviser.</p> 
       <p>For a description of the minors in A&amp;S, see department offices or Web sites. </p>

       <h2>College Degree Requirements - The 2003 A&amp;S Core</h2> 
       <p><strong>Bachelor of Arts or Science Programs</strong></p> 
       <p>Beginning fall 2003, new university and college general education curricula, the 2003 University Studies Program (USP) and the 2003 A&amp;S Core, were implemented. Refer to the USP section of this Catalog for details regarding University Studies requirements. Students who matriculate for the first time at UW or a Wyoming community college in fall 2003 or after are required to follow both the new USP and A&amp;S Core. Students transferring from a Wyoming community college with an associate's degree and the Wyoming Core completed between May 2001 and fall 2003, may continue to complete the 1991 USP and 1991 A&amp;S Core requirements (if there has been no interruption in their enrollment for a year or more). Students who matriculated at UW or a Wyoming community college prior to fall 2003 and choose the 2003 USP must also complete the 2003 A&amp;S Core requirements. For additional information please refer to the sections in this Catalog that describe the university graduation requirements, the 2003 University Studies Program, an<br>the policies for reenrolling at UW after an absence of a year or more.</p>

       <p>All other university and college regulations apply. See "Graduation: Requirements and Procedures" section of this Catalog for more information. Graduate level "Enrichment" courses do not count toward the requirements for a bachelor's degree. </p> 
       <h2>2003 A&amp;S Core Curriculum</h2> 
       <p>Graduates of the College of Arts and Sciences are expected to be liberally educated-to have the knowledge and skills to deal with the unexpected and to see opportunities from multiple perspectives. A liberal education enhances the intellectual flexibility needed to find new applications for knowledge and to offer varied solutions to complex problems. To develop these abilities, the college faculty designed the A&amp;S Core (requirements differ slightly for students in some professional degree programs; check with your adviser). </p> 
       <p><strong>1. SCIENCE: Two (S, SB, SP, SE) courses with laboratories, eight credit hours.</strong> See the University Studies Program section in this Catalog, or the Web for approved courses. Science courses of 3 credit hours will not be accepted, such as GEOL 2080 and LIFE 2002. Some USP-approved science courses that are three credit hours have a separate course listing for a one credit hour lab (e.g., ENTO 1000 and 1001) in which A&amp;S students must enroll.</p> 
       <p><strong>2. UPPER DIVISION:&nbsp; 9 credit hours of upper division courses outside the prefix of the department/program in which the student's major resides.</strong> These courses may not simultaneously fulfill the University Studies Program Core Components (Intellectual Community, Quantitative Reasoning, Oral Communication, Constitutions, Writing A, Sciences, or Cultural Context). </p> 
       <p>These courses may not be cross-listed with the department of the major. This cross-listing rule does not apply to majors in A&amp;S interdisciplinary programs (American Indian studies, American Studies, Earth System Science, Environment and Natural Resources, Microbiology, International Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, and Religious Studies). </p> 
       <p>Students in distributed majors (Humanities/Fine Arts, Mathematics/Science, and Social Science) must take the nine credit hours outside the first area of emphasis and these courses may not be cross-listed with that department/program. </p> 
       <p>These nine hours count toward the university requirement of 48 upper division credit hours required for a bachelor's degree. </p> 
       <p><strong>3. FOREIGN LANGUAGE:&nbsp; Two courses with the same prefix, eight credit hours.</strong> </p> 
       <p>The College of Arts and Sciences requires:<br><br></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>For students at the introductory level of a language, 2 courses (8 credits total) in the same language are required.</li> 
        <li>For students who place into the second semester, 1 course (4 credits) in the language previously taken is required.</li> 
        <li>Students who place out of both semesters by CLEP, AP or UW department placement exam are not required to take additional language courses to meet the A&amp;S requirement, unless their department has an additional requirement.</li> 
        <li>Departments who require more than the A&amp;S required 2 courses are Anthropology, English, History, International Studies, and Modern and Classical Languages.&nbsp; Also, Anthropology is the only one of these five departments that allows American Sign Language to fulfill the requirement.</li> 
        <li>Foreign students who are native speakers of a language other than English are exempt from this requirement if they successfully complete the Writing A and B courses. Foreign students whose pre-college high school education is in an English-speaking high school are held to the College foreign language requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p><br>The only exceptions to the foreign language requirement are: <br><br></p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Professional degree programs in Chemistry; Music Education; Instrumental and Keyboard Music Performance; Physics Plus, and Wildlife and Fisheries Biology and Management allow a choice of two semesters of a single foreign language or 6 credit hours in upper-division courses outside the major department’s rubric.&nbsp; Students majoring in Vocal Music Performance, however, must take 8 credits of a foreign language (credit by examination and American Sign Language do not count for vocal music majors). </li> 
        <li>Foreign students who are native speakers of a language other than English and who finished high school in their native country in a non-English speaking school are exempted from this requirement upon successful completion of the University Studies Writing A and Writing B requirements.</li> 
        <li>Native American students enrolled in a degree program in the College may earn up to 12 credit hours by passing an oral examination. If a student is successful in this oral examination, the College foreign language requirement is satisfied.</li> 
        <li>Applications for examinations are available in the Office of the Registrar. After initial approval, the student takes the application to the Department of Modern &amp; Classical Languages. There is a sitting fee that also covers posting of any credits earned.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p><br>Students who wish to study abroad as a part of their undergraduate experience, and those who might apply for Fulbright Awards for post-baccalaureate work, should consider completing more than one year of language study. <br><br>We encourage students with high school foreign language courses to take the Language Placement Exam while the language is still fresh for you.&nbsp; You may be able to earn credit for your knowledge and place into the next appropriate course by taking the Credit by Exam option.</p> 
       <p><strong>4. NON-WESTERN PERSPECTIVES:&nbsp;&nbsp; One approved course, 3 credit hours.</strong> A Non-Western Perspectives course is about and from the perspectives of non-Western European, non-Judeo-Christian traditions. This course may simultaneously fulfill other requirements in the University Studies Program, A&amp;S Core, or the student's major. As they are approved, additional courses will be listed at <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/as">http://www.uwyo.edu/as</a>.</p> 
       <p>Approved Non-Western courses:</p>

       <p><strong>5. Professional Degree Programs and the A&amp;S Core:</strong>&nbsp; For several of the professional degree programs, the A&amp;S Core has been reduced slightly - students may choose between the foreign language requirement and six-upper division credits outside the major department's prefix. The Departments of Art and Theatre &amp; Dance require the entire A&amp;S Core for their B.F.A. degree programs. Check with your department for detailed information. See also the Professional Degree Programs section below. </p> 
       <h2>College Degree Requirements Prior to Fall 2003 for Continuing and Re-enrolling Students</h2> 
       <p>A&amp;S Core requirements for a student continuing a degree program in effect at the time of matriculation at UW are found in the relevant previous Catalog. Contact the Dean's office with any questions. </p> 
       <p>Students who re-enter the university after an absence of a year or more should refer to other sections of this Catalog for university policies and procedures. Unless approved otherwise, reenrolling students, after a year's absence, are required to follow the University Studies and A&amp;S Core requirements in effect the semester of their re-enrollment. However, all majors in A&amp;S who have yet to complete the Non-Western requirement, regardless of their initial enrollment, must refer to the current list of approved courses. </p> 
       <p>Check sheets and lists of courses that satisfy A&amp;S college core requirements are available on the Web at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/as">http://www.uwyo.edu/as</a> or in the Dean's office.</p> 
       <p>Departments and programs in the College of Arts and Sciences may require reenrolling students to complete requirements in the major that meet the current expectations of the discipline.</p> 
       <h2>Transfer Students and Acceptance of Transfer Credit</h2> 
       <p>The College of Arts and Sciences and its departments reserve the right to grant transfer credit toward the bachelor's degree only for those courses where a grade of C or better was earned. Students transferring credits from a university or college outside Wyoming with questions about how courses taken elsewhere fulfill the A&amp;S Core may contact the Center for Advising and Career Services (222 Knight Hall , 766-2398).</p> 
       <h3>Courses Taken for S/U Credit</h3> 
       <p>Students may include up to 20 semester credit hours in free electives with a grade of S as part of the total hours required by the College of Arts and Sciences for graduation. However, no S/U hours may be used to satisfy university and college core general education requirements or major requirements, including the required 48 upper-division credit hours unless the course is offered for S/U grading only.</p> 
       <p>Students registering in courses for S/U grades are subject to all general regulations.</p> 
       <h3>Professional Degree Programs</h3> 
       <p>Professional curricula are available in seven fields. A minimum of 129 hours is required, and may include one credit of physical education activity and wellness, and lower division armed forces credits in 1010, 1020, 2010, 2020 and the ROTC upper division courses. Students enrolled in professional curricula must earn a grade of C or better in the major and fulfill all other college and university requirements including at least 48 hours of course work at the upper-division level with 30 of these from UW. For some professional programs, exceptions have been made to the A&amp;S Core requirements. Students should verify curriculum requirements with the appropriate department and/or the college dean's office.</p> 
       <p>The eight professional programs consist of the following:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Art (B.F.A.) </li> 
        <li>Chemistry - (ACS certified) (B.S.) </li> 
        <li>Microbiology (B.S.) </li> 
        <li>Music education (B.A.)</li> 
        <li>Music (Performance) (B.M.) </li> 
        <li>Physics Plus (B.S.) </li> 
        <li>Theatre and dance (B.F.A.) </li> 
        <li>Wildlife and fisheries biology and management (B.S.) </li> 
       </ul> 
       <h3>Concurrent Majors</h3> 
       <p>Students may pursue two or more majors simultaneously. With careful planning, A&amp;S students may be able to use all or most of the free elective hours for requirements in the other majors. Refer also to the section, "Graduation: Requirements and Procedures" in this Catalog. </p> 
       <p>The A&amp;S Core must be met only once by students whose primary major is in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students whose degree programs are in other UW colleges are welcome to earn a concurrent major in A&amp;S. These students do not have to meet the A&amp;S Core requirements. The student earns one degree with one diploma. </p> 
       <p>Students pursuing a concurrent major must contact both departments involved for assignments to advisers. </p> 
       <h3>Dual Degrees</h3> 
       <p>Students may simultaneously pursue degrees in the same or more than one UW college. In addition to requirements described in the section "Graduation: Requirements and Procedures" in this Catalog, students in another UW college who wish to earn a degree from A&amp;S must also complete the A&amp;S Core. A&amp;S students working on dual degrees in the A&amp;S College need to meet the A&amp;S Core just once. A diploma is awarded for each degree.</p> 
       <p>Each additional degree requires 30 more credit hours added to the 121 credits (or 129 for professional degrees) to the primary degree. Of these 30 credits, 12 have to be at the 3XXX-4XXX levels.</p> 
       <h3>Second Bachelor's Degrees</h3> 
       <p>For students seeking a second bachelor's degree in the College of Arts and Sciences <strong>whose first degree is from another university</strong>, the minimum requirements include: </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>30 semester hours earned from the University of Wyoming, 12 of which must be upper division (3XXX-4XXX level) or graduate level (credit by examination does not count as UW hours). </li> 
        <li>Completion of the U.S. and Wyoming Constitutions requirement (V courses in the University Studies Program course list in this Catalog). </li> 
        <li>If the first degree is from an institution where English is not the predominant language, the Writing A and B requirements of the University Studies Program must be completed successfully. </li> 
        <li>Students must also meet the 2003 A&amp;S Core requirements. </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>For students <strong>whose first degree is from UW:</strong> </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>The additional required 30 hours (12 of these at the 3XXX-4XXX) are added to the degree requiring the least number of hours. For example, for a first degree in a non-professional program, A&amp;S requires 121 hours. So the total credits a UW student would have to complete for the second bachelor's degree is a minimum of 151 credits. Since the University requires a total of 48 upper division hours for a degree, for the second degree from A&amp;S, a UW student would need to earn a total of 60 hours at the 3XXX-4XXX level. For more information, please see the Second Bachelor's Degree entry in the section, "Graduation: Requirements and Procedures" in this Catalog. </li> 
        <li>Students whose first degree is from another UW college must meet the 2003 A&amp;S Core requirements. </li> 
        <li>Students whose first degree is from one of the A&amp;S professional degree programs with a modified A&amp;S Core and are seeking the second A&amp;S degree in a non-professional degree program must complete the additional 2003 A&amp;S Core requirements. </li> 
        <li>Students who earned their first degree from the College of Arts and Sciences in a non-professional degree program have already met the A&amp;S Core requirements. Please contact the A&amp;S dean's office if your first degree from the UW College of Arts and Sciences was earned prior to Fall 2003 (307) 766-4106, <a href="mailto:asdean@uwyo.edu">asdean@uwyo.edu</a>. </li> 
        <li>In situations in which a student is subsequently required to take coursework from another collegiate institution to fulfill major and overall hour requirements for a second degree from the university, the student's department can ask the Office of the Registrar to load selected courses into the student's record.</li> 
       </ul> 
       <h3>Distributed Majors Programs</h3> 
       <p>The specific requirements for majors in humanities/fine arts, mathematics/science and social science are outlined below.

These courses cannot also simultaneously fulfill the USP requirements for QA, QB, P, V, SB, SE, SP, S, WA, CA, CH, CS, C, or O. </p> 
       <p>All other university and college requirements apply. </p> 
       <p>Students pursuing this major may go to the Department of Mathematics for assignment to an adviser. </p> 
       <h3>Self-Designed Major</h3> 
       <p>The Self-Designed Major (SDM) is an option for students who want a program of study that allows them to develop intellectual interests not now addressed by traditional majors and minors. The SDM encourages diversity and flexibility while requiring a clear academic focus and a unifying purpose. Most SDMs are interdepartmental and multidisciplinary. </p> 
       <p><strong>Program requirements.</strong> Students are admitted to the program at least 3 semesters before their anticipated graduation. They must have a GPA of 3.0 and are expected to fulfill all university and college requirements. Students must maintain a minimum cumulative 3.0 GPA while in this program. </p> 
       <p><strong>Application for the Program.</strong> Students first see an associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (109 A&amp;S) who explains the program and helps with the application process. With the guidance of an appropriate faculty member, students prepare a three- to five-page rationale for the SDM and a specific list of courses, including a minimum of 24 hours of formal course work and 6 hours of independent study to be used to prepare a senior paper or project. Sixteen of the 24 hours of the formal coursework must be in A&amp;S departments or programs. Students also need a letter of support from a primary faculty adviser, as well as consent from two or more additional faculty, to serve on their supervisory committee. Once the SDM Faculty Council has reviewed the application, it interviews each student and then notifies him or her of its decision. Any modifications of the program must be approved by the student's supervisory committee and the SDM Faculty Council. </p> 
       <p><strong>Senior Project.</strong> Approximately two months before the end of the senior year, each student submits a project or paper which summarizes or typifies the SDM. The project is then evaluated by the supervisory committee. The supervisory committee makes a recommendation to the SDM Faculty Council which recommends the student for graduation. Students will receive the appropriate bachelor's degree with the major shown as Self Designed Major: _________ (name of focus). </p> 
       <h3>Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Degree Program</h3> 
       <p>This intercollegiate, interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science program approaches the study of the Earth as a system, integrating the anthrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere to understand its complex interactions and prepare students to address issues of global environmental change.</p> 
       <p>In addition to ESS Core and Foundation courses in math, physics, chemistry, geographic information science, remote sensing, and biogeochemistry, students select a concentration in one of the participating departments. The current participating departments in the College of Arts and Sciences include anthropology, botany, geography, and geology/geophysics and the biology program. The college of the student's concentration department awards the degree. Students whose concentration is in one of the Arts and Sciences departments are also required to complete:</p> 
       <p>1.&nbsp; Eight college-level credit hours of a foreign language (American Sign Language is acceptable) , or acceptable scores in AP, CLEP, International Baccalaureate, or the Modern and Classical Languages department's language placement examination.</p> 
       <p>2. An approved non-Western course which may simultaneously fulfill a University Studies requirement.</p> 
       <p>For more information, go to <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/ESS">www.uwyo.edu/ESS</a> or see Dr. Robert D. Kelly (rkelly@uwyo.edu) in the Engineering Building, room 6072, or contact the A&amp;S participating departments.</p> 
       <h3>Microbiology Interdepartmental Program</h3> 
       <p>The Bachelor of Science degree program in microbiology is an intercollegiate and interdisciplinary major with faculty and courses from the Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, and Health Sciences. Students may obtain their degree in either the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources or the College of Arts and Sciences. Students who wish to earn this degree from the College of Arts and Sciences are required to complete the following A&amp;S Core requirements:</p> 
       <p>1. Two four-credit science courses with labs and with two different prefixes.</p> 
       <p>2. One approved three-credit course in the non-Western category.</p> 
       <p>For the major requirements, contact Program Director Ken Mills in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources Building, 766-6638/6684, kmills@uwyo.edu and the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources section on Microbiology in this Catalog.</p> 
       <h3>Concurrent Major in Environment and Natural Resources</h3> 
       <p>A student majoring in any A&amp;S department/program may essentially earn a double major by completing the courses required for the Environment and Natural Resource (ENR) program in addition to the requirements in their A&amp;S major and the College A&amp;S Core general education program. The School of ENR Web site,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/enr/">http://www.uwyo.edu/enr/</a> has detailed information, or contact the School at (307)-766-5080.</p> 
       <h3>Preprofessional Studies</h3> 
       <p>The College of Arts and Sciences prepares students to enter professional schools through preprofessional programs of study described below. </p> 
       <p><strong>Prelaw Study.</strong> Students usually need a bachelor's degree prior to beginning the study of law. There is no prescribed course of undergraduate study and no restrictions as to the field in which the degree is earned. However, to prepare for this competitive profession, prelaw students are advised to select courses that help to develop those talents and skills essential to the study and practice of law. Logical and critical thinking, conflict evaluation/resolution and effective verbal/nonverbal communication skills are essential. Additionally, students should understand the political, economic, social and cultural institutions and values that characterize human society. Rigorous courses in any discipline increase abilities in these areas. Regardless of the prelaw major, courses in the broad liberal arts--the sciences, social sciences, fine arts and humanities--increase understanding of the public's diverse interests and backgrounds. </p> 
       <p>Prelaw students do not have to declare a major at the time of first enrollment if they wish to explore options. Students who are undeclared in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences are assigned advisers in the UW Center for Advising and Career Services until they decide upon a degree program.&nbsp; Please note that a prelaw minor is available.&nbsp;</p> 
       <p>In addition to an adviser in the major, prelaw students may contact the designated UW prelaw adviser for assistance in developing a program of study, for career counseling and for guidance in applying to law schools. Contact Michell Anderson, A&amp;S 152, 766-2641, <a href="mailto:manders2@uwyo.edu">manders2@uwyo.edu</a> for information. A bulletin board for prelaw students is located in the south hallway, 1st floor of the A&amp;S Building. Students are encouraged to use these resources.</p> 
       <p>Additional information and useful resources may be found on the pre-law Web site, <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/as/current-students/pre-law.html#advisors">www.uwyo.edu/as/current-students/pre-law.html</a>. Detailed information about applying to law schools, the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) and preparation materials, and links to other web sites are at www.LSAC.org.</p> 
       <p>The active pre-law club invites all prelaw students to join. For information, contact the prelaw club adviser, Michell Anderson at <a href="mailto:manders2@uwyo.edu">manders2@uwyo.edu</a>. </p> 
       <p><strong>Library Preprofessional Study.</strong> Librarians are information professionals who research, organize, and classify materials so the public can access information. Not only do they work with printed materials, but all the technological advances in digital media such as electronic databases and eBooks. Some librarians focus on teaching the public, scholars, and students how to access and use these materials, while others concentrate on collecting and maintaining these diverse resources. Librarianship offers many career opportunities to people of different academic backgrounds, interests, and talents. Most public, academic, and special libraries require a Master's degree in library science (MLS). </p> 
       <p>The degree programs and minors in the College of Arts and Sciences offer the variety of academic preparation expected by accredited library schools in the country. Most of the graduate schools in library science require a bachelor's degree, a good undergraduate record, and a reading knowledge of a foreign language for admission. The best undergraduate preparation includes a wide range of courses in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities along with a strong concentration in one subject area. The choice of a major will be determined by the student's academic interest and professional objective. The general education that the University Studies and the A&amp;S Core require provide the well-rounded background graduate schools expect of their MLS candidates. </p> 
       <p>Additional information about library schools, their requirements, and programs as well as career opportunities may be obtained from the reference desk at Coe Library and the Center for Advising and Career Services. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics "Occupational Outlook Handbook" at www.bls.gov/oco/home.htm has detailed descriptions of the varied work of librarians, working conditions, employment outlook, and sources for additional information. </p> 
       <p><strong>Premedical, Predental and Preoptometry Study.</strong> Students with the most promise and the best undergraduate preparation have the competitive advantage in being admitted to these professional programs. These schools are favorably impressed by a broad educational background, including a substantial number of both non-science and science courses; therefore, students are well advised to look beyond the minimum requirements. </p> 
       <p>Students may select any major in which they are interested. In addition to completing all university, college and departmental requirements, students must include in their curriculum the basic professional school requirements such as courses in biology, chemistry, math, and physics. Professional schools have other specific requirements and students should learn about any additional recommendations from those professional schools in which they are interested. For assistance, contact the preprofessional adviser in the College of Health Sciences, 110 &amp; 112 Health Sciences Center, (307) 766-6704 or 766-3499, or preprof.hs@uwyo.edu. </p> 
       <p>Common majors in the College of A &amp; S for these preprofessional programs include chemistry, biology, psychology, physiology, and zoology. However, there are preprofessional students in programs as diverse as theatre and dance and anthropology. Students need not declare a major immediately upon first enrollment. Advisers in individual departments can discuss options or if students wish to remain undeclared, they are advised in the UW Center for Advising and Career Services. </p> 
       <p>Preprofessional assistance is available in the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Psychology, and Zoology/physiology. The preprofessional advisers in the College of Health Sciences have current information regarding professional school admission requirements, entrance examinations, programs in Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education (WICHE), Wyoming Medical Contract Program WWAMI (affiliated with the University of Washington School of Medicine) and financial assistance for professional education. The honor society for students enrolled in preprofessional studies, Alpha Epsilon Delta, is also administered in the College of Health Sciences. The Web site,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/preprof/">http://www.uwyo.edu/preprof/</a> includes additional information. </p> 
       <h3>Internships</h3> 
       <p>Many departments in the College of Arts and Sciences offer internships for academic credit, and some provide monetary compensation. Academic internships provide practical, hands-on experience in a professional job setting as a complement to classroom instruction. An internship can provide students with both insight and preparation for future jobs. All internships require a strong background in writing, organizational ability and analytic skills. Junior or senior standing is recommended. </p>
