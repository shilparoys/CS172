       <div class="article"> 
        <p>Professor Richard Kaplan is featured on CNN&nbsp;discussing President Obama's plans to tackle income inequality through tax reform.</p> 
        <p>"Tackling tax reform more broadly could be a pathway to bipartisan cooperation that creates a genuine achievement for both President Obama and the new Congress. In that context, repealing the "step-up in basis" rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code."</p>

       <div class="article"> 
        <p>Professor Arden Rowell has published an article in <em>Science</em>, one of the world’s top scientific journals.</p> 
        <p>The article advocates for an institutional process for regular Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) review and revision when used in government policy-making and suggests how scientists might contribute to improved SCC estimates.</p> 
        <p>The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a crucial tool for economic analysis of climate policies. The SCC estimates the dollar value of reduced climate change damages associated with a one-metric-ton reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Although the conceptual basis, challenges, and merits of the SCC are well established, its use in government cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is relatively new.</p>
