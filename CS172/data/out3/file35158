      "Our first core value is to have a positive attitude. Again, really simplistic. Really simplistic. That's something that we can control. We talk about controlling the controllable -- waking up every single morning with a positive attitude and being really appreciative of the opportunity we have at Penn State. We talk about waking up in the morning and doing a back handspring out of bed, ready to attack the day with everything you have."

     <description>
      Penn State University Police and State College Police have announced the joint implementation of Tasers for trained police officers. Tasers, which use an electrical impulse to briefly immobilize violent or resisting suspects, provide a safer option for arresting individuals who are clearly at risk of harming themselves or others. With the joint announcement, Penn State’s University Park police and the State College Police Department are the last to add Tasers among all police departments in Centre County.
