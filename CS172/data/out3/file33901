That&rsquo;s the conclusion from <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/10.1126/sciadv.1400082\">a new study</a> that links an increasing risk of decades-long drought episodes in the western United States to human-induced climate change. The study predicts drought severity outside the bounds of what&rsquo;s thought to have occurred over the past 1,000 years, based on local tree-ring records.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not good news,&rdquo; said co-author Jason Smerdon, a climate scientist at Columbia University&rsquo;s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The study was published Thursday in the inaugural issue of <em>Science Advances, </em>an open-access journal from AAAS, the same publisher as <em>Science</em>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Smerdon&rsquo;s study is the first to examine the future risk of &ldquo;megadrought&rdquo; in the southwest and central United States in the context of historical episodes of drought in the same regions. Smerdon&rsquo;s study suggests that the coming years are likely to see droughts worse than the epic dry periods that are thought to have caused <a href=\"http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2009/04/lessons-from-lost-anasazi/\">profound changes to human settlement</a> in the region over the last millennium.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re &lsquo;mega&rsquo; because they are droughts that lasted in these regions for multiple decades,&rdquo; said Smerdon in an interview with <strong><em>Slate</em></strong>. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this since at least the 1400s.&rdquo; In comparison, the <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/topics/t/thirsty_west.html\">current California drought</a> is four years old, though drought has been present in most of the last 15 years somewhere in the West.\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"still rgb-158-159-153 photo focus-295-189 domcolor-d67e2e-934d20-48461f-646932-e3ecec-cac8bc-9f9e98-7d8182-6a6c66-50504c-353233 color img\">\n        <img src=\"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/02/150212_FT_Sign01.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"590\" height=\"382\" original-width=\"590\" original-height=\"382\" hints=\"color,domcolor-d67e2e-934d20-48461f-646932-e3ecec-cac8bc-9f9e98-7d8182-6a6c66-50504c-353233,focus-295-189,photo,rgb-158-159-153,still\"/>\n      </div>\n      A digital traffic sign southbound on Interstate 5, in Del Mar, California Sept. 10, 2014.\n      <p>\n        Photo by Mike Blake/Reuters\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <script><\/script>\n    <p>\n      Drought, especially the kind that affects agriculture, can be thought of as a balance between water supply (precipitation) and water demand (uptake by plants and people), the latter of which is strongly driven by evaporation rates linked to temperature.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Smerdon&rsquo;s research suggests that rising temperatures connected to climate change&mdash;not necessarily a decrease in precipitation&mdash;will boost the risks of drought far beyond that caused by historic natural variability. In the last half of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Smerdon says to expect a surge of dryness he and his co-authors call &ldquo;unprecedented.&rdquo; In the worst-case scenario climate pathway&mdash;<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26243-world-on-track-for-worstcase-warming-scenario.html\">the one the world is currently on</a>&mdash;the new research suggests a greater than 80 percent risk of megadrought after 2050.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The story is pretty straightforward: The cause is increasing levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere,&rdquo; said Smerdon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To come to this conclusion, Smerdon and his colleagues used a range of soil moisture indicators and 17 different climate models to calibrate future global warming&ndash;influenced droughts based on the past. &ldquo;The surprising thing to us was really how consistent the response was over these regions, nearly regardless of what model we used or what soil moisture metric we looked at,&rdquo; said lead author Benjamin Cook in a press release. Cook&rsquo;s father, Edward, helped create the North American Drought Atlas, a collection of tree rings that forms the basis for the historical analysis in the new study.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The future looks as bad or worse as even the most severely dry intervals&mdash;the paleoclimate intervals&mdash;encompassing these megadrought periods that we&rsquo;ve seen,&rdquo; said Smerdon. Smerdon notes that although some of the models they examined show a slight increase in precipitation by the end of the century, that signal is &ldquo;overwhelmed&rdquo; by the increase in evaporation due to warmer temperatures.\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"still rgb-239-239-237 light graphic focus-327-177 domcolor-60aeaf-c49a82-93ac76-cac1b7-eeebe5-a9b7b3-d5d7d5-76746d-9b9e9d-484748-1e1e1e color img\">\n        <img src=\"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/02/150212_FT_Chart.png.CROP.original-original.png\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"660\" height=\"364\" original-width=\"660\" original-height=\"364\" hints=\"color,domcolor-60aeaf-c49a82-93ac76-cac1b7-eeebe5-a9b7b3-d5d7d5-76746d-9b9e9d-484748-1e1e1e,focus-327-177,graphic,light,rgb-239-239-237,still\"/>\n      </div>\n      The outlook for Western drought over the next 50-80 years looks grim.\n      <br/>\n      <p>\n        Courtesy Cook et al/Science Advances\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <script><\/script>\n    <p>\n      The new study is generally in line with a broad consensus of research from <a href=\"http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/news/2004/story10-05-04b.html\">the last 10 years</a>, though it comes with added certainty given the robust methods the authors used. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say that this is a surprise, but the evidence has been growing for years now,&rdquo; said Peter Gleick, a hydroclimatologist at the Pacific Institute in Oakland, California, who was not involved in the research.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This study highlights the fact that not only can you not ignore temperature, but temperature is a huge driver of drought,&rdquo; Gleick told <strong><em>Slate</em></strong>. &ldquo;That effect is enough to push us into a regime that&rsquo;s worse than the worst droughts in recorded history. It&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The work is the clearest evidence yet that worsening drought in the West and Midwest will inflict fundamental changes on the American landscape, with implications for tens of millions of people from San Francisco to Las Vegas and from Dallas to Des Moines. Though the ongoing California drought continues to dominate headlines&mdash;2014 was the state&rsquo;s warmest year on record by a wide margin&mdash;Smerdon and his colleagues show that we should be equally concerned about fundamental risks to agricultural sustainability in the heartland, too.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We cannot hope that losses in the Southwest will be made up in the Midwest, according to this study,&rdquo; said Gleick. &ldquo;There are degrees of screwed, and this paper suggests we&rsquo;re falling off the cliff.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"still rgb-68-76-155 photo focus-295-195 domcolor-131c82-343284-545995-7b89b2-cbd0d7-69645e-837f7c-969392-a6a5a6-433f3d-272424 color img\">\n        <img src=\"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/02/150212_FT_Sign02.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"590\" height=\"393\" original-width=\"590\" original-height=\"393\" hints=\"color,domcolor-131c82-343284-545995-7b89b2-cbd0d7-69645e-837f7c-969392-a6a5a6-433f3d-272424,focus-295-195,photo,rgb-68-76-155,still\"/>\n      </div>\n      An exhibit area at the 47th Annual World Agriculture Expo in Tulare, California, Feb. 12, 2014.\n      <p>\n        Photo by David McNew/Reuters\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <script><\/script>\n    <p>\n      Gleick emphasizes that the new research is particularly troubling because demographic trends point toward increased population in these same areas over the same timescale.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/10/california_central_valley_agriculture_drought_and_climate_change_photos.html\">current drought in California</a> appears to fit the model of the types of &ldquo;hot droughts&rdquo; that the new paper predicts for the rest of the century. However, Smerdon rightfully acknowledges that the scientific jury&rsquo;s still out on direct linkages between the current drought in the West and climate change.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      So far this winter, California&rsquo;s snowpack is at near-record lows despite statewide precipitation that&rsquo;s close to average. In 2015, there have been record-setting rains, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/01/29/california_s_drought_is_now_even_more_horrible.html\">record-setting dry spells</a>, and record-warm temperatures in northern California. Most of the storms so far this winter have been simply too warm to produce much snow in the mountains, a trend that&rsquo;s expected to continue to worsen in the future.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;All the things we were hoping wouldn&#39;t happen 5-10 years ago are happening and I don&#39;t think we have sounded the alarm fast enough,&rdquo; said Stephanie Castle, a researcher at the University of California&ndash;Irvine whose <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/07/lake_mead_before_and_after_colorado_river_basin_losing_water_at_shocking.html\">recent work</a> focuses on Western groundwater depletion, in an email to <strong><em>Slate</em></strong>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Though Smerdon is quick to note he&rsquo;s not qualified to advise governments on public policy, he said the answer to America&rsquo;s growing megadrought problem is simple: &ldquo;Quit dumping CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an inevitable outcome that these are the paths we&rsquo;ll take,&rdquo; said Smerdon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>This article is part of Future Tense, a collaboration among&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.asu.edu/?feature=research\"><em>Arizona State University</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.newamerica.org/\"><em>New America</em></a><em>, and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Slate</em></strong><em>.&nbsp;Future Tense explores the ways emerging technologies affect society, policy, and culture.

Durell\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        In an interview with Bay Area Bites, Bittman, talked about everything from biking (&ldquo;The style here is much less aggressive [than NYC]&ndash;people stop for lights and all sorts of crazy things&rdquo;), to what grocery stores he&rsquo;s excited about (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shopping at <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.montereymarket.com/\">Monterey Market</a>, and the farmers&rsquo; markets. I haven&rsquo;t shopped outside of Berkeley yet, which I&rsquo;m proud of&rdquo;), but he was most eager to talk about the issues of food politics that have composed his opinion columns over the last few years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Over the last few years, you started writing more about food issues instead of just recipes for the <em>Times</em>. What precipitated that&ndash;did you have a specific &ldquo;come to God&rdquo; realization, or was it more of a gradual shift?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There wasn&rsquo;t a come to God. I was political when I was in my 20s. My come to God moment was the Vietnam War.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Food is attached to the environment, food is attached to health, food is attached to labor, food is attached to social justice, income inequality, it&rsquo;s all there. Forgive me, but you&rsquo;re an idiot if you think you can think about food in a vacuum without thinking about those other issues.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And then it becomes a political question. Who do you think this country should be run for? I think this country should be run for the benefit of the majority of its people. It&rsquo;s not being run that way right now. When it is, some of these problems will have taken care of themselves. Sometimes we&rsquo;re talking about food, and sometimes we&rsquo;re talking about the bigger picture. Social justice. Democracy. Government. Capitalism.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>You&rsquo;ve said that we&rsquo;re focusing on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://storify.com/DeannaJour231/michael-pollan-mark-bittman-talk-food-policy\">wrong kind of agricultural research</a>&ndash;what should we be looking at instead?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The focus on ag research for the last 50 or 75 years has all been about yield. We&rsquo;ve proven that we can grow a lot of corn, and we&rsquo;ve proven that we can do really amazing things with increasing yield. But that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about. We need to grow food that has minimal impact on the environment&ndash;that&rsquo;s probably not compatible with thinking that yield is the most important thing. We need to grow food that is fair&ndash;that may not be compatible with increasing yield. We need to grow food that&rsquo;s not poisonous&ndash;that&rsquo;s probably not compatible with yield. Let&rsquo;s back up a little bit and ask different questions. Let&rsquo;s pretend we don&rsquo;t know as much as we do and say, &ldquo;If we were starting again, how would we grow food? What would make sense?&rdquo;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>You touched on this in your recent <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-a-national-food-policy-could-save-millions-of-american-lives/2014/11/07/89c55e16-637f-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html\">editorial with Michael Pollan</a> about a national food policy.</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Suppose we started with the notion that food that is sustainable, nutritious, fair and affordable [should be] available to everybody in the United States. It&rsquo;s not a ridiculous thing to say. It&rsquo;s actually quite primitive, really. We don&rsquo;t say that. But if we did say that, how would we then go about fulfilling that mission statement? Suppose we make that our mission statement. I don&rsquo;t know how we get to that place, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean we shouldn&rsquo;t be asking those questions.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>What would it take to get there?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Well, if Obama was a progressive as we thought he was in 2008, and if there had been a cooperative congress all the way through&ndash;it might have happened. Maybe he should have pushed it in 2008 when there was a more cooperative congress. I think what it takes is a well-intentioned president, a well-intentioned Congress, a not-stacked Supreme Court. It&rsquo;s a lot. It may not happen in my lifetime. It may not happen in your lifetime. But that is the goal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We can all make changes in our own lives, we can all eat better. We can shop at farmers&rsquo; markets, we can talk about this stuff until we&rsquo;re blue in the face. We can convince all our friends to eat well, blah blah blah&ndash;that&rsquo;s change, that&rsquo;s for real.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        But there&rsquo;s some change that&rsquo;s going to have to come from the top down. You need agencies that don&rsquo;t have revolving door policies so that you have principled people running agencies. You need to have courts that understand that when an agency makes a decision, it&rsquo;s a well-intentioned decision and the industry shouldn&rsquo;t be able to challenge every single thing that affects them and so on down the line. When do those stars align?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I feel like in every interview I wind up saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not patient enough.&rdquo; And the fact is, I have to remind myself that I&rsquo;m not patient enough. I think change should happen more quickly, but I&rsquo;ve thought that my whole life, and now I&rsquo;m 65 years old.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Some changes happen quickly. I think it&rsquo;s a less racist country than it was 40 years ago, it&rsquo;s a less sexist country than it was 40 years ago, it&rsquo;s certainly a less homophobic country than it was 40 years ago. Those are amazing changes, right? And if you&rsquo;re a woman or a black person or a gay person, you might think well, not soon enough. It&rsquo;s not for me to say, I&rsquo;m none of those things, but what I can say is that I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of change, and now we&rsquo;re seeing change in food.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And really, the food thing, this conversation, is only&ndash;when was <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://michaelpollan.com/books/the-omnivores-dilemma/\"><em>Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma</em></a> published? When was <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0547750331\"><em>Fast Food Nation</em></a> published? This conversation is only 10, 12 years old, and it&rsquo;s been a broad conversation for only five years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>What&rsquo;s stuck out to you as a turning point in this conversation? Has it been a bunch of small changes or one big change?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Labor has really stuck out for me. The fact that people who cared about food did not talk about labor five years ago and now they do talk about labor, that&rsquo;s a big deal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>What do you think caused that change and awareness?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You can shame people and say &ldquo;You talk about animals all the time but what about humans?&rdquo; Even if humans are just animals, why would you care more about the cows than the people in the slaughterhouse? Why would you care more about the lettuce than the farm workers? I think people started to get that. I did write a column, I don&rsquo;t think it was a very good, but it was an interesting notion: I wrote a column about <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/opinion/mark-bittman-rethinking-the-word-foodie.html\">redefining the word &ldquo;foodie&rdquo;</a> and what people who express an interest in food ought to be interested in, and how that has changed.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        You didn&rsquo;t ask me what I had for lunch. You&rsquo;re not talking to me about how great the food is in Berkeley, have I been to Oakland and eaten at blah blah blah, what my favorite restaurant is in San Francisco or how cool the farmers&rsquo; market is and all the great stuff you can buy there even though it&rsquo;s January. We&rsquo;re not talking about that. We&rsquo;re talking about the politics of food. That&rsquo;s incredible. Five years ago, we would not be having this conversation. That&rsquo;s a big change.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>You talk about all these insurmountable issues&ndash;what makes you optimistic?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Wendell Berry said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be optimistic, be hopeful.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s changed? Many things have changed for the better. <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/ct-mcdonalds-results-0124-biz-20150123-story.html\">McDonald&rsquo;s lost a ton of money</a> this year already, farmers&rsquo; markets are still on the upswing, people talk about food in a way that they didn&rsquo;t used to talk about it, there&rsquo;s a lot of changes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>You&rsquo;ve mentioned the new food policies by countries like Greece and Spain and&ndash;what, if any, countries are doing it &ldquo;right?&rdquo;</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        No one&rsquo;s doing it &ldquo;right.&rdquo; Mexico has a national soda and junk food tax, that&rsquo;s pretty cool. Brazil has a kind of right-to-food statement, that&rsquo;s pretty cool, but it hasn&rsquo;t fulfilled it, so that&rsquo;s disappointing. I&rsquo;m not aware of anyone who&rsquo;s doing it right.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And besides, this is America. It&rsquo;s unlikely we&rsquo;re going to mimic anybody. A problem is that we&rsquo;ve set a bad example in many ways and other countries have followed it. We have shown how bad food can be. We have shown how unhealthy food can be. If you wanted to devise a really bad diet, you couldn&rsquo;t do a much better job of doing that than we&rsquo;ve done unintentionally. I think eventually that will change, but it may change other places more quickly than it changes here.\n      </p>\n      <div class=\"single-video\">\n        <span></span>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        <strong>At the &nbsp;2014 New York Times Food for Tomorrow Conference, you said that we have enough food to feed the world (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWKa9DWSlz4\"><strong>view speech</strong></a>). &nbsp;So what should we instead be talking about when addressing hunger and access issues?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        It&rsquo;s money that&rsquo;s the problem. It&rsquo;s not a food issue; it&rsquo;s a justice issue. You have never seen a hungry rich person and you never will. You&rsquo;ll probably never be [hungry]. I never will either. Because we&rsquo;ll have 20 dollars in our pocket. If we&rsquo;re hungry we&rsquo;ll go buy something to eat. There is enough food. It&rsquo;s just a money question.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>The Bay Area has a notable <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas.aspx\">amount of food deserts</a>&ndash;for example, just a few miles away from where we are in Berkeley, with its &nbsp;farmers&rsquo; markets and numerous grocery stores, there are <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert_in_West_Oakland\">parts of West Oakland</a> that don&rsquo;t have access to anything like that. What are some ways to combat those kinds of discrepancies?</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        What about using schools as distribution centers for subsidized fruits and vegetables? Many people have children, and they go to schools. If you don&rsquo;t have a child, you could still go to the school. There&rsquo;s a school in every neighborhood. Neighborhoods are not school deserts; no one calls them school deserts.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        I mean if you&rsquo;re talking about a desperate situation&ndash;people can&rsquo;t get healthy food&ndash;we are paying, and I don&rsquo;t say this begrudgingly, but we are paying for the costs of people eating bad food. We call that health care costs. You get sick when you eat bad food. You&rsquo;re paying one way or another, so why not pay for prevention instead of cure? Especially since the cures don&rsquo;t work. And the way to pay for prevention is to guarantee that people can eat decent food.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the short term, some people are going to suffer. Nothing I can say can change that. I can&rsquo;t come up with some hocus pocus &ldquo;You can cook a mixture of water and cement and it turns into a good dinner.&rdquo;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        People are suffering. we need to fix that. but that&rsquo;s not a cooking problem. if there&rsquo;s a cooking problem, I can solve it. Cooking is easy. Social justice problems are not so easy.\n      </p>\n      <div id=\"ctx-module\" class=\"ctx-module-container ctx-clearfix\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n","sourceURL":"http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/2015/02/13/bittman-does-berkeley-talking-food-politics-with-mark-bittman/","feedTitle":"All KQED Stories","feedUrl":"http://www.kqed.org/rss/kqed_all.xml","hideOnCover":true,"language":"en,h=0","rssBaseURL":"http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/2015/02/13/bittman-does-berkeley-talking-food-politics-with-mark-bittman/","rssCustomClasses":"sysundefined","articleStats":{"words":1912,"paragraphs":37,"characters":10751},"sourceURLKey":"a-yO-blF9pRF6m6KUwxV0VkA:a:49907754-1d52cda939/kqed.org","customizer":{"url":"http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/2015/02/13/bittman-does-berkeley-talking-food-politics-with-mark-bittman/","id":"flipboard:yO-blF9pRF6m6KUwxV0VkA:a:49907754","customizations":{"image":"http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/files/2015/02/bittman.jpg"}},"referredByItems":[{"type":"status","authorDisplayName":"University of California","authorUsername":"ucfiatlux","userid":"49907754","authorDescription":"UC provides the sparks that fire imaginations, industries, California and the world.

The fourth-year international development studies major watched her own mother, a single parent, do it when she was temporarily unemployed. Moreno is now chronicling on video the story of a single mother of five as she struggles to meet the same challenge.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Fellow UCLA senior Sanna Alas, a human biology and society major, knows the value that urban gardening can bring to a community. She is helping students at Jordan High School in Watts tell their story through film as they turn an abandoned plot of land into a community garden for their school.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Alas and Moreno, who started these projects in the fall quarter when they were taking a class on filmmaking for social change, are now expanding their documentaries, thanks to a $2,500 fellowship that each project received from the UC <a href=\"http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/dozens-uc-students-awarded-global-food-initiative-fellowships\">Global Food Initiative Student Fellowship Program</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        &ldquo;This fellowship supports our project beyond the classroom,&rdquo; said Alas. &ldquo;We want to build upon it, make it bigger and include the voices of more people.&rdquo;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The <a href=\"http://universityofcalifornia.edu/global-food-initiative\">University of California Global Food Initiative</a>, launched in July 2014, is a systemwide commitment to harness UC resources to sustainably and nutritiously feed the world&rsquo;s population by 2025. Moreno and Alas are two of 16 UCLA undergraduate and graduate students to receive funding from this initiative to support four projects.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Other funded UCLA ventures include a research project to evaluate the impact and sustainability of farmer hubs in California that sell to large institutions&nbsp;&mdash; such as school districts and universities &mdash; and the creation of two new student-run vegetable gardens at UCLA that will be used to educate others about the benefits of a campus garden. A raised bed garden is scheduled to be built at Hershey Hall this winter, with an amphitheater garden to be installed at the Sunset Canyon Recreation Center in the spring.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Additionally, matching funds for two of these projects&nbsp;&mdash; the documentary being produced by Moreno&#39;s group and the community garden project&nbsp;&mdash; were provided by the <a href=\"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/healthy-campus-initiative-takes-242912\" target=\"\" title=\"\">UCLA Healthy Campus Initiative,</a> which is funded by generous support from Jane and Terry Semel.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        &ldquo;I want to congratulate the inaugural class of Global Food Initiative student fellows,&rdquo; said UC President Janet Napolitano in a statement. &ldquo;These are outstanding students who are passionate about this important global topic and will be able to make valuable contributions to this initiative through these fellowships. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing the results of their projects.&rdquo;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As a member of Mentors for Academic and Peer Support, one of 29 organizations operated through the <a href=\"http://uclacommunityprograms.org/\">UCLA Community Programs Office</a>, Alas, along with two other UCLA students, is making a short documentary to tell the story of the Jordan High students and that of other urban gardeners in L.A.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        &ldquo;We chose to work on urban gardening because we believe that it strongly connects with current issues regarding health, food access and social justice throughout L.A.,&rdquo; said Alas.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Alas&rsquo; documentary will also feature a weekend gardener at Wattles Farm community garden in Hollywood and a Native-American woman who incorporates her ancestral beliefs into a gardening class she teaches at the Autry Museum&rsquo;s Southwest Museum. In the next phase of production, Alas plans to allow the Jordan High students to shoot their own footage as they turn neighborhood blight into a neighborhood asset.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        &ldquo;We want to put the camera into the students&rsquo; hands and have them take ownership,&rdquo; Alas said. &ldquo;We want them to tell the story of their own community.&rdquo;\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Health, food access and social justice are also at the root of the documentary being produced by Moreno and her team of four. The film, which draws attention to the relationship between food advertising and childhood obesity, follows single mother Stefani Gilmore as she tries to feed her family of six nutritionally, using the federal Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Moreno&rsquo;s team hopes to raise awareness of the issues faced by low-income and single parents and help motivate policymakers tighten up restrictions on advertising that markets food to children.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        &ldquo;I know what it&rsquo;s like to be constrained monetarily and nutritionally,&quot;` said Moreno. &ldquo;It surprises me that more people are not aware of the realities faced by people in their own neighborhoods.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not true that poor people eat fast food because they&rsquo;re lazy and don&rsquo;t want to cook for themselves, she said.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        &ldquo;They eat fast food because it&rsquo;s the cheapest thing they can afford, and it&rsquo;s readily available,&rdquo; Moreno said. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re working more than 40 hours a week, or not working at all, and taking care of a large family, you don&rsquo;t have that much time to think about what&rsquo;s for dinner. You&rsquo;re just trying to survive.&rdquo;\n      </p>\n    <\/body>\n  </html>\n</div>\n","sourceURL":"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/students-film-a-mothers-struggle-to-buy-healthy-food-on-a-tight-budget","feedTitle":"Health + Behavior - UCLA","feedUrl":"http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/health-sciences-rss.xml?type=healthandmedicine","language":"en,h=0","rssBaseURL":"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/students-film-a-mothers-struggle-to-buy-healthy-food-on-a-tight-budget","rssCustomClasses":"sysundefined","articleStats":{"words":788,"paragraphs":16,"characters":4809},"sourceURLKey":"a-BnfNxtzTTIy3SotVB_IQtQ:a:49907754-2b2435eb51/ucla.edu","customizer":{"url":"http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/students-film-a-mothers-struggle-to-buy-healthy-food-on-a-tight-budget","id":"flipboard:BnfNxtzTTIy3SotVB_IQtQ:a:49907754","customizations":{"image":"http://cms.ipressroom.com.s3.amazonaws.com/173/files/20151/54d4f928bd26f51f43018455_napolitano-garden-students/napolitano-garden-students_mid.jpg"}},"authorDisplayName":"Rebecca Kendall","userid":"fl:ucla.edu","referredByItems":[{"type":"status","authorDisplayName":"University of California","authorUsername":"ucfiatlux","userid":"49907754","authorDescription":"UC provides the sparks that fire imaginations, industries, California and the world.

   <p>\n      What if we connected the people most in need of&nbsp;healthy food with the expensive, nutrient-dense greens that just happen to be&nbsp;growing between the cracks in their driveways? A project at UC Berkeley is testing out this idea. Philip Stark, chair of the Berkeley statistics department, has organized a team of researchers <a href=\"http://forage.berkeley.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">to map edible plants in low-income neighborhoods</a>, with the goal of creating a website that will show residents how to find food close to their homes.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the U.S., poverty <a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/79/1/6.full\" target=\"_blank\">is highly correlated with&nbsp;obesity and diet-related disease</a>. If poor people actually found it feasible to eat foraged greens, the public health benefit could be immense. And incidentally, the places labeled as food deserts &mdash; the low-income neighborhoods without markets, but plenty of overgrown yards &mdash; are also the places where Stark is finding the most edible weeds. &ldquo;The hypothesis is that the food is already there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not recognized as food.&rdquo;\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I asked Stark if I could tag along with him some time when he went out looking at plants, which he said he does nearly every day. We met at his home in the Berkeley hills and strolled the winding roads.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A walk with a forager is not a leisurely expedition. Stark did not gaze&nbsp;out at the vistas, nor remark on the architectural details of the houses we passed. Instead, he stared intently at the margins of the road, and regularly broke off mid-sentence to dash to one side or the other and inspect something green and nondescript. He&nbsp;is tall, lean, and balding, with close shorn hair and a week&rsquo;s worth of bristles on his face. He wore sandals (a simple sole attached to his foot with leather laces), loose gray pants, and an unblemished rust-orange Arc-Teryx windbreaker. He rattled off&nbsp;Latin and common names faster than I could write them down. &ldquo;<em>Lactuca virosa</em>,&rdquo; he said, squatting and plucking a hairy leaf. &ldquo;Opium lettuce, or bitter lettuce.&rdquo; He put it into his mouth and chewed. I did the same. It was bitter, not overwhelmingly so, but also not something I&rsquo;d want to eat in bulk. &ldquo;I actually quite like things with stronger flavors,&rdquo; Stark said. He&rsquo;ll use a bitter leaf or two&nbsp;like a spice, to punctuate an otherwise conventional&nbsp;omelette or piece of meat.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <figure id=\"attachment_276745\" class=\"grist-img-container aligncenter\" style=\"width:660px\">\n      <div class=\"still rgb-54-79-35 photo focus-330-218 domcolor-99cf49-5d9133-316226-1f3c1f-c9e19d-101b0f-7188a5-97ae80-415a57-434430-f0f1e3-65756b color img\">\n        <img src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/wild-onion.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" original-width=\"660\" original-height=\"440\" hints=\"color,domcolor-99cf49-5d9133-316226-1f3c1f-c9e19d-101b0f-7188a5-97ae80-415a57-434430-f0f1e3-65756b,focus-330-218,photo,rgb-54-79-35,still\"/>\n        <br/>\n      </div>\n      <figcaption class=\"caption fl:caption\">\n        Wild onion.\n        <br/>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      &nbsp;\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A little farther on we came to a little sloping triangle of dirt between a driveway and the road. Stark began listing the edible species there. &ldquo;Bristly ox tongue, curly dock, miner&rsquo;s lettuce, mallow, fennel, chickweed, sow thistle, cow parsnip, wood sorrel, nasturtium &hellip; Here&rsquo;s a 10-ingredient salad, more than you could get in a mixed mesclun bag at the farmers market. And it&rsquo;s free.&rdquo;\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On the second day of official fieldwork for the project, Stark told me, he and his compatriots bumped into another team looking for precisely the same plants. It was a team of city workers in hazardous-materials suits, spraying herbicide to kill the greens. They were in West Oakland, where&nbsp;lived people whose diets would surely be improved by eating those weeds. Here were two problems &mdash; people in need of free health food, and weeds in need of removal &mdash; that might be combined to form a single solution.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Let&rsquo;s call it a potential solution for now. There are still&nbsp;issues to sort out. First, is it safe to eat greens growing amid herbicide, auto exhaust, dog poop, and the mystery fallout of urban grime? Second, will the people who most need more greens in their diet have the time to forage, and wash, and cook them?\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Stark is running a battery of tests to answer the first question. Plants do absorb pollution, but it&rsquo;s unclear if they take in enough to cause a concern.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The second question is tougher. Foraging makes perfect sense if you are cash poor and time rich. But it makes no sense when you&rsquo;re working three jobs and still broke. Several attempts to <a title=\"Food desert mirage: Better groceries may not bring better health\" href=\"http://grist.org/food/food-desert-mirage-better-groceries-may-not-bring-better-health/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed_cities\" target=\"_blank\">fix food deserts have failed</a> because the problem isn&rsquo;t simply that people lack access to vegetables &mdash; they also may not have the skills to make them delicious, or the time to prepare them.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <hr class=\"text-break\"/>\n    <p>\n      Let me admit here to some skepticism about urban foraging.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a skepticism that comes from listening to the edible-plants people, who share valuable knowledge but always seem to insist on mixing in a liberal helping of dubious claims.&nbsp;The foragers who are particularly prone to making assertions that are fantastic (if you want to be polite) or obviously false (if you don&rsquo;t) can be divided into three categories:&nbsp;the survivalists, the herbalists, and the tastebud-less.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <figure id=\"attachment_276748\" class=\"grist-img-container aligncenter\" style=\"width:660px\">\n      <div class=\"still rgb-119-174-130 photo focus-330-218 domcolor-789c46-497432-97b777-598d5c-6ba278-90c7ac-a7d0b3-665350-1e2017-796a6d-3e3f35 color img\">\n        <img src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_42241.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" original-width=\"660\" original-height=\"440\" hints=\"color,domcolor-789c46-497432-97b777-598d5c-6ba278-90c7ac-a7d0b3-665350-1e2017-796a6d-3e3f35,focus-330-218,photo,rgb-119-174-130,still\"/>\n        <br/>\n      </div>\n      <figcaption class=\"caption fl:caption\">\n        Broad-leafed dock.\n        <br/>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      The survivalists were the ones with the conviction that they could someday subsist on plantain heads and dock leaves. Rebecca Lerner carried out that experiment, and&nbsp;described&nbsp;it&nbsp;in her book, <em><a href=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780762780624-4?&amp;PID=25450\">The Dandelion Hunter</a>.</em> After a week of living off the land in Portland, eating salads and weak, vegetative teas, she wrote:\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n        My body was achy and limp. My legs were so weak that I had to brace myself against the wall like an old lady who lost her walker.\n        <br/>\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      She&nbsp;wisely gave in, and cut off her experiment to gorge&nbsp;on Thai food, noting, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thin line between badass and dumbass.&rdquo;\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The herbalists are the ones who insist on telling me that such and such is good for the liver or will flush out my toxins. I&rsquo;m a fan of alternative medicine, but when I&rsquo;m trying to learn something I like my information to be evidence-based. When someone tells me earnestly that Echinacea cures colds (even though I know it&rsquo;s been studied to death and ultimately <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000530.pub3/abstract;jsessionid=283A2CCBFCB44A02ED3A80464B0DD68A.f03t03\">looks like a good placebo</a>) it makes me doubt everything else I&rsquo;m learning from them.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Then there&rsquo;s the tastebud-less: The folks that munch on tough old dandelions and proclaim them delicious.&nbsp;As <a href=\"http://grist.org/author/tama-matsuoka-wong/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed_cities\">Tama Matsouka Wong</a> writes in her book <a href=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780307956613-6?&amp;PID=25450\"><em>Foraged Flavor</em></a>, it&rsquo;s easy to find books to tell you what is edible, but the &ldquo;existing books offered recipes with instructions such &lsquo;parboil in water three times to remove bitterness&rsquo; or &lsquo;braise the milkweed shoots for two hours.&rsquo; It sounded too much like space shuttle or survival food &mdash; the kind of thing you would only eat if you were starving in the wilderness!&rdquo;&nbsp;The highest praise in many guides is &ldquo;mildness&rdquo; &mdash; the ability of a plant to pass through your mouth undetected. One of the books in that vein is <em>Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America,</em> by Alfred C. Kinsey; it contains a comprehensive listing of species, but doesn&rsquo;t tell you what to do with them. (The same might be said, incidentally, of Kinsey&rsquo;s more famous reports on human sexuality &mdash; plenty of facts, but no advice for the lay reader on putting them into practice.)\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The foraging literature frequently ignores flavor &mdash; there&rsquo;s a touch of the apocalyptic asceticism in many of the guidebooks. They carry the implication that, come the cataclysm, there will be no place for those who hesitate to scarf down hairy bittercress.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      These three breeds of forager specialize in&nbsp;promising&nbsp;far more than is reasonably possible.&nbsp;So if you&rsquo;re skeptical about the possibility of low-income Americans foraging in cities for bitter greens, I get it.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But we shouldn&rsquo;t let the&nbsp;hyperbolic foragers out there spoil what, done right, can be a truly good thing. The people who stick with it eventually figure out that dandelion greens won&rsquo;t feed the starving, and that edible does not equal&nbsp;delicious. (Sadly, though, it seems harder to shake the habit of pronouncing herbs cure-alls.) Experienced foragers understand that you can&rsquo;t actually survive on wild salads alone: It&rsquo;s fruits, nuts, seeds, roots, and meat that provide the calories. In her book, Lerner eventually finds her foraging groove; with the help of a small village of friends, she assembles a Thanksgiving dinner which she calls &ldquo;an impressive display: rose hips sauce, roasted cattail, nettle, mushrooms, wapato, venison, scones, and even wild beer.&rdquo;\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I&rsquo;d be pleased&nbsp;to get that at a fancy San Francisco restaurant.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <figure id=\"attachment_276422\" class=\"grist-img-container aligncenter\" style=\"width:660px\">\n      <div class=\"still rgb-67-113-81 photo focus-330-218 domcolor-3e644d-304f3b-719d73-e2f2c4-c8e0b4-203225-f5fbe3 color img\">\n        <img src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_4228.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" original-width=\"660\" original-height=\"440\" hints=\"color,domcolor-3e644d-304f3b-719d73-e2f2c4-c8e0b4-203225-f5fbe3,focus-330-218,photo,rgb-67-113-81,still\"/>\n        <br/>\n      </div>\n      <figcaption class=\"caption fl:caption\">\n        Fennel.\n        <br/>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      And of course, the finest restaurants are serving foraged weeds already. Daniel, the New York eatery with two Michelin stars, and Copenhagen&rsquo;s Noma, often called the best restaurant in the world, both rely on foraged foods &mdash;&nbsp;tapping the flavors and textures of things people normally don&rsquo;t think of as food.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The success of those restaurants renewed my interest in foraging. I have no desire to be the sort of guy who tries to serve his family survivalist salads of the &ldquo;actually, starvation is sounding pretty good right now&rdquo; school. But Wong, who forages for Daniel, has published a book&nbsp;full of recipes and advice for turning weeds into high cuisine.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We&rsquo;ve reached a strange moment when foraging is firmly associated with upper class food &mdash; so much so that it&rsquo;s impossible to say you are serving, for example, <em>foraged sheep sorrel</em> or<em>&nbsp;wild fennel sprigs</em> without it sounding a bit pretentious. This is&nbsp;strange, because foraging was once a refuge for the desperately poor, and still is in many&nbsp;places.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <hr class=\"text-break\"/>\n    <p>\n      In 1922, Euell Theophilus Gibbons was 11 years old, and his family was starving. His father had left their homestead in rural New Mexico to look for work, and his mother was sick &mdash; she was giving the food she had to her four children, rather than eating herself. They ate their animals, one by one. The horse died, and the family dog ate her. The 11-year-old Gibbons&nbsp;went out looking for food &mdash; and he found it. He found rabbits and prickly pears, mushrooms and berries. He fed his family every day for a month until his father returned. And he never stopped foraging.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Forty years later &mdash; 40 years spend hoboing, and cotton picking, and bronco busting, and working as a communist agitator &mdash; Gibbons wrote a book about foraging titled <em><a href=\"http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780911469035-0?&amp;PID=25450\">Stalking the Wild Asparagus</a>. </em>It was a bestseller. It&rsquo;s this book that seeded the idea of foraging into the nascent environmental movement, setting the taproot for the later success of restaurants like Daniel. The root of our current fussy fascination with foraging was a hungry kid in New Mexico, searching the desert for something he could give his mother.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gibbons counsels that deep wilderness is a poor place to go looking for food. The best spots, he writes, are &ldquo;old fields, fence rows, burned off areas, roadsides, along streams, woodlots, around farm ponds, swampy areas and even vacant lots.&rdquo; The plants that are good for people to eat travel and live with us. Dandelions came to the New World on the Mayflower, though historians don&rsquo;t know if they were meant to be a medicine or food. (Dandelions can provide real sustenance if you dig up their starchy roots, rather than trying to eat their leaves.)\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <figure id=\"attachment_276752\" class=\"grist-img-container aligncenter\" style=\"width:660px\">\n      <div class=\"still rgb-98-130-53 photo focus-330-218 domcolor-2b470c-819f29-e9e14d-a8bd38-486718-63832c-7e9e4b-f6f58d-9ab764-b7ce7f-0d1208-fafbcc color img\">\n        <img src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_42231.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" original-width=\"660\" original-height=\"440\" hints=\"color,domcolor-2b470c-819f29-e9e14d-a8bd38-486718-63832c-7e9e4b-f6f58d-9ab764-b7ce7f-0d1208-fafbcc,focus-330-218,photo,rgb-98-130-53,still\"/>\n        <br/>\n      </div>\n      <figcaption class=\"caption fl:caption\">\n        Sourgrass or wood sorrel.\n        <br/>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      I&rsquo;ve been researching the plants and animals that thrive alongside humans, and that&rsquo;s what got me interested in foraging. My research is for a book I&rsquo;m writing &mdash; a sort of urban field guide to the species that are so common they&rsquo;ve become invisible. I tend to dislike invasive plants, because they take over and crowd out diversity. But when I began to look closely at these weeds I saw a lot to admire. They grow in incredibly hostile environments, without water, fertilizer, or even soil. They grow despite the fact that people frequently pull them up and poison them. They are tough, versatile, and resilient. And, as Wong points out, the chemicals that make these weeds so strong&nbsp;also give them the powerful flavors prized by chefs. There&rsquo;s something about these flavorful plants that seems to endow the people who eat them with health &mdash; these phytochemicals are mysterious&nbsp;because they are frequently poisons, produced by plants to keep themselves from being eaten. But the theory is that, because we evolved eating low doses of these&nbsp;toxins, we need them: <a href=\"http://grist.org/food/plants-are-poison-and-that-just-may-be-why-they-keep-us-healthy/?utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed_cities\" target=\"_blank\">They create&nbsp;a&nbsp;stress response, much like&nbsp;exercise does, and give your system a work out</a>.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Eating weeds has allowed me to engage with the natural world in a new way. I chew on peppery nasturtium leaves on my way to work. When I&rsquo;m making a sandwich and realize we&rsquo;re out of greens, I just go outside and grab some.&nbsp;I pluck unfamiliar plants and take them home for identification.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Once your brain registers that there&rsquo;s food out there, your brain starts interacting with the environment in a different way,&rdquo; Stark told me. I believe it. What was once just a green jumble in every unmown verge has began to gain focus for me.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      My 3-year old, who never learned not to see these plants, can identify almost as many species as I can. As a game, I&rsquo;ll sit on our stoop and send her off to search for oxalis or dock, and a few minutes later she&rsquo;ll come running back with the correct leaf. She normally hates to eat anything green, but she&rsquo;ll happily sample what she gathers. It still seems miraculous to me that toddlers &mdash; and all of us actually &mdash; can pick one nondescript plant out of many. When you learn an edible plant, there&rsquo;s something that clicks into place. Here&rsquo;s how Gibbons described it to the writer John McPhee:\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>\n        It&rsquo;s exactly like recognizing someone&rsquo;s face; once you know a person, you know that person from all other people. If you came home at night and a woman you had never seen was standing in your house, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it was your wife. God help you anyway if you would.\n        <br/>\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      The contemplative pleasure of getting to know my natural neighbors is a middle-class luxury. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be taking the time to learn and taste my weeds if I was a single parent, hustling to get my kids fed and into bed. I might, however, have the time if I were a child of that single parent &mdash; like Gibbons.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s often at least one person in a household who could make time to forage if they knew how, or had a good mentor.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There&rsquo;s a sense of rootedness that comes with knowing the wild things in a place, and a&nbsp;satisfaction that comes with finding food to help support your family. I&rsquo;m not talking like a survivalist here &mdash; there&rsquo;s no way people in West Oakland are going to get the bulk of their calories from weeds any time soon.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m just pointing out that a small helping of foraged greens each day could make people healthier, even if it&rsquo;s layered in a fast-food hamburger to provide some&nbsp;crunch.\n      <br/>\n    </p>\n    <figure id=\"attachment_276760\" class=\"grist-img-container aligncenter\" style=\"width:660px\">\n      <div class=\"still rgb-127-145-117 photo focus-243-183 face-243-183-70 domcolor-558735-14290e-335625-6ea16c-90837f-686558-ddd5db-e4e1e6-cecdd1-c3c2c5-b1b1b4-9f9e9b color img\">\n        <img src=\"https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_42292.jpg?w=660&amp;h=440\" data-size=\"medium\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" original-width=\"660\" original-height=\"440\" hints=\"color,domcolor-558735-14290e-335625-6ea16c-90837f-686558-ddd5db-e4e1e6-cecdd1-c3c2c5-b1b1b4-9f9e9b,face-243-183-70,focus-243-183,photo,rgb-127-145-117,still\"/>\n        <br/>\n      </div>\n      <figcaption class=\"caption fl:caption\">\n        Chickweed.\n        <br/>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n      There&rsquo;s no need&nbsp;to make airy&nbsp;claims about the detox powers of wild plants, when we can instead point to the clear, well-established, and powerful benefits of eating leafy green vegetables.

But is foraging any more of a long shot than urban gardens? When the Obamas planted a garden on the White House lawn it became a symbol of the struggle to get fresh healthy food into the hands of ordinary Americans. I&rsquo;m a supporter of gardens in general, and that garden specifically. But&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to point out that it was preceded by&nbsp;other symbols on the White House lawn. Once, many years before anyone knew the name Obama, Euell Gibbons put his arm through the fence surrounding the White House to pick four different edible plants.
