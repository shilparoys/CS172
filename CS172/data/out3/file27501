    <p>However, if you can answer <strong>No</strong> to <strong>all</strong> of the following questions, you are considered a dependent student and generally your <a href="JavaScript:HelpLink('ffdef07.htm','','/help/');">parents</a> <u>must</u> provide parental information on your FAFSA:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Were you born before January 1, 1992?</li>

     <li>Do you now have or will you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016?</li> 
     <li>Do you have dependents (other than your children or spouse) who live with you and who receive more than half of their support from you, now and through June 30, 2016?</li> 
     <li>At any time since you turned age 13, were both your parents deceased, were you in foster care or were you a dependent or ward of the court?</li> 
     <li>As determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you an emancipated minor?</li> 
     <li>As determined by a court in your state of legal residence, are you or were you in legal guardianship?</li>

    <p>If you have a special circumstance that prevents you from providing parental information, you <strong>may</strong> still be able to submit your FAFSA. However, your FAFSA will be considered incomplete. You must contact the financial office at your college and provide them with documentation to verify your situation.
