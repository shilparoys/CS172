    Religion and Spirituality
    </b><br>
    Religion may indicate a far deeper and more prevalent sensibility or mode of life than we ordinarily imagine it to be.  This is surely so if we focus beyond so-called 'organized religion' as the primary reference of 'religion.'  Today's frequent references to 'spirituality' evidence a popular, grass roots religiosity, little different in fundamental content from most religions, although perhaps organized (or disorganized) differently from what most would call 'religion.'<br><br>
    Thus, although 'spirituality' is often opposed to 'religion,' their similarities strike one as far more prominent than their supposed differences.  Both move in a world that honors reverence, sacredness and holiness, or the transgressive, tabu and forbidden; both suggest realms of being not exhausted by the world of everyday quantifiable life; both imagine a cosmic, rather than merely local frame of reference for human action, whether that be the karmic realm of samsara and release from it, the universe, natural world or some other vast reference of existence. For this reason, we consider religion and spirituality sufficiently related terms, and leave it to others to quibble about the differences.</p>

    <p><b>
    Grassroots and Spontaneous Spirituality
    </b><br>
    Two related features of recent spirituality or religious sensibility are what we would call their 'grassroots' and spontaneous qualities.  Just as there is a pop art or folk art that simply and spontaneously appears in public spaces -- like certain fashions in dress and personal adornment (backwards hats, piercing, skateboarding, X-games, long or short hair, etc.), or the graffiti art of modern cities -- so there is also a parallel phenomenon of spontaneous, mostly urban, popular folk religion.  Like these representations of popular imagination, folk spirituality or religion just 'happens' too. Historians of  Christianity have shown how popular pre-Christian spiritual fashions for visions or care of the dead have at times had a great vogue, then taken up by Christians and, as it were, 'baptized' into respectability, only later to fade as the religious imagination turned towards other devices. The popular, grassroots, generally unpremeditated representations of religion or spirituality that we have in mind and would like to feature in this site are what we call 'spontaneous shrines.'</p>

    What Spontaneous Shrines Are
    </b><br>
    By spontaneous shrine, we mean:
    <br><br>
    <ul type="dics">
      <li> a bounded physical space, </li>
      <li> dedicated informally or formally to some person or event, </li>
      <li> that becomes reserved and sacred, </li>
      <li> but which had been considered until that point profane until it had become dedicated, </li>
      <li> by virtue of formal, generally irregular, actions (rituals) performed there sanctifying it, </li>
      <li> or by the various objects or persons being located there, whose proximity sanctified it, </li>
      <li> or by the events that occurred at, near or in referrence to the same place, and which are memoralized and which sanctify it, but </li>
      <li> typically not by the offices of official religious or other authorities. </li>
    </ul>
