       <h2>Implementation of the Framework Begins</h2>
      </div> 
      <p>First of all, thank you to the entire campus community for your continuing support, interest and work toward moving our Strategic Framework for Diversity and Inclusion to the next level. We truly are moving 'Forward Together.'</p> 
      <p>The vetted final version of the Forward Together, a Diversity Framework for UW–Madison was introduced in October 2014 and presented in a series of sessions to students, faculty and staff across campus, including at the Annual Diversity Forum. The sessions, which were attended by more than 300 participants, included a call for members to serve on the six committees charged with exploring the first round of goals and projects that were prioritize from the 30 overall recommendations embodied by the plan.</p> 
      <p>The six committees comprised of faculty, staff and students are:&nbsp;</p> 
      <p> </p> 
      <ol> 
       <li>Faculty/Staff Professional Development and Capacity-Building Experiences</li> 
       <li>Undergraduate Curriculum</li> 
       <li>Administration and Accountability</li> 
       <li>Access and Recruitment</li> 
       <li>STEM Initiatives</li> 
       <li>Retention and Research</li> 
      </ol> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>These six committees are now working to meet a March 1, 2015, deadline for formulating the first round of recommendations called for in the Frameworks goals and recommendations. This stage is labor and time intensive, and we appreciate the commitment, effort and enthusiasm these individuals are investing in the process. In addition to exploring specific projects and steps within in the topic areas outlined in the framework, each committee is charged with:&nbsp;</p> 
      <p> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Providing estimates of efforts and costs;</li> 
       <li>Developing a clear implementation time line, including suggestions for transition from pilot to full implementation and/or lifespan of the particular recommendations;&nbsp;</li> 
       <li>Develop measurable outcomes and metrics for success;</li> 
       <li>Explore opportunities to share data to promote best practices that foster a more inclusive campus climate.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>But this is just the beginning. There is plenty of work ahead and anyone who was unable to commit to this round of committees, or who is interested in participating and wasn't contacted, please plan to join in the ongoing rounds of work to move our plan forward. Please begin by contacting my office at 265-5228 to get on the volunteer list. </p> 
      <p><strong>How will the recommendations from the working committees be handled? </strong></p> 
      <p>The recommendation from the recommendation working six committees will be assembled by my office and presented to the Provost and Chancellor by late April. </p> 
      <p>In late March and Early April, we will have another series of follow-up sessions to present the first-round recommendations in their entirety the both the campus and larger Madison community. Work will begin on the first-round priorities ranging from the development of diversity-centric leadership experiences to building stronger connections to the broader Madison community this spring.</p> 
      <p>Again, I want to remind you that this Framework will pull in participants based on their area of expertise and sphere of impact on campus, so no one should be surprised to get a call to participate. Tasks ranging from budgeting to student services and curriculum integration to innovative research are all included in how this Framework differs from past diversity plans in its use of actionable, inclusive solutions at countless levels and stages. These are the keys to progress toward our intended goals. </p> 
      <p>As I’ve said in the past, in order to actualize our institutional vision for diversity we need to work together as a campus community to formulate the specific action items that will bring the goals of the framework to life. We will work together in a broadly inclusive process which offers everyone a stake and a role in the implementation. We’ve leaned into the discussion, now we’re preparing to lean into the work and the process of evaluating of our effectiveness.</p> 
      <p>The four continuing reasons driving the process of prioritization of recommendations and projects include: </p> 
      <p> </p> 
      <ol> 
       <li>they are strategic priority areas for the VPCDO;</li> 
       <li>many are natural extensions of efforts currently run successfully out of the VPCDO’s Division of Diversity Equity &amp; Educational Achievement;</li> 
       <li>they demonstrate potential for the broadest, most lasting impact; and</li> 
       <li>they can be implemented within existing budget parameters with limited additional cost.</li> 
      </ol> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>And once again, I want to remind everyone that eight of the fourteen recommendations fall under the strategic work already underway in my office. These items will be expanded to include suggestions and strategies which emerge from our spring semester discussions and community teach-ins surrounding contemporary issues on community policing.</p> 
      <p>The remaining framework recommendations will be addressed either by the units in which these are current initiatives, or by the Campus Diversity and Climate Committee (CDCC). Our efforts will be prioritized with consideration of available staffing, budget and time; therefore, some recommendations may be tabled for future action. We will revisit the remaining recommendations in the next year with to see if we can identify opportunities to shift in attention and resources.</p> 
      <p>Please feel free to share any questions or comments with us, or volunteer to get involved, at <a href="mailto:jointhediscussion@cdo.wisc.edu">jointhediscussion@cdo.wisc.edu</a> or call 608-265-5228.</p> 
      <p>Optional overviews to include:</p> 
      <p>An Overview of the CDCC Review of Recommendations:</p> 
      <p> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Rec. 1.3 – Support faculty who further the fields of ethnic studies through education or research.</li> 
       <li>Rec. 2.1 – Build on the positive strengths of UW-Madison’s decentralized administrative and policy development infrastructure.</li> 
       <li>Rec. 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8 – Climate surveys; unit strategic diversity plans; support mechanisms for 2nd and 3rd shift supervisors.</li> 
       <li>Rec. 4.1 – 4.5 – Stronger relationships between UW-Madison’s campus and the Greater Madison area and Wisconsin communities; holistic admissions policy and process; linguistic, cultural and physical access to all UW-Madison recruitment activities; increased availability and awareness of scholarships and financial aid opportunities; expanded awareness, availability and capacity of student services.</li> 
       <li>Rec. 5.2 – 5.5 – Student support services including advising, early warning system, non-traditional student support services, leadership development and mentoring services.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>Phases of the implementation process include:</p> 
      <p> </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Phase 1 (years 1-3): The intent is to move swiftly through Phase 1, which in the next 6-18 months is to identify and execute with input from key stakeholders actionable items relating to the 14 identified recommendations.</li> 
       <li>Phase 2 (concurrent with Phase 1): VPCDO will work closely with the CDCC (Campus Diversity and Climate Committee) to address the remaining recommendations through key discussions with relevant constituency groups of faculty, staff and students to assess the feasibility and potential for broad impact.</li> 
       <li>Phase 3 (year 5): Commence a midpoint review and assessment of the diversity framework efforts to date. This midpoint review will also serve as an opportunity to identify next steps regarding the remaining recommendations that have yet to be implemented. Phase 4 (years 6-8): Depending on the success and implementation rate of phases 1-3, this phase will serve as a second round of implementable recommendations.</li> 
       <li>Phase 5 (years 9-10): will conclude the 10-year arc of implementation and serve as the wrap-up and final reporting on the accomplishments; remaining recommendations will be identified as opportunity areas for the next 10 year strategic diversity plan/framework. &nbsp;</li>
