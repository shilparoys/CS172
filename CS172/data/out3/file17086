  <p align="center"><a href="http://www.wjin.net/vioxx_lawyers.html">Vioxx Lawyers</a>. In September of 2004, when Merck voluntarily removed their prescription pain medication, Vioxx, from the market, Product Liability Law once again moved into the realm of every day news. Lawyers for every day people took on one of the world's largest drug companies. The battles are still raging.</p> 
  <p align="center"><a href="http://www.wjin.net/education_lawyers.html">Education Lawyers</a>. The most obvious example of this was the suits against various school boards to stop the practice of segregation. When the Supreme Court declared that separate school systems were not, by law, equal school systems, it was up to a whole cadre of lawyers and judges to determine what constituted a separate, segregated school system.</p> 
  <p align="center"><a href="http://www.wjin.net/real_estate_lawyers.html">Real Estate Lawyers</a>. In earlier days there was just one lawyer involved in the sale of a house; the one that handled the closing of the sale. He sat at the head of the table and moved the paperwork back and forth between the seller and the buyer. He was the one that held the money until all of the paperwork was done.</p>
