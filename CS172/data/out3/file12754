                       <p>A student is expelled from high school. A copy of his disciplinary record is sent to the school district’s law enforcement unit so that school security can keep the student off campus.

                       <p class="scenario_answer"> No. The student disciplinary record, although now maintained by the school’s law enforcement unit, does not become exempt from the definition of “education records” merely because it is maintained by the security unit. As such, the disciplinary record would be considered the student’s “education records” and could not be disclosed by the law enforcement unit to the media. </p>

Once the contents or information recorded in sole possession records is disclosed to any party other than a temporary substitute for the maker of the records, those records become education records subject to FERPA. Generally sole possession records are of the nature to serve as a “memory jogger” for the creator of the record. For example, if a school official has taken notes regarding telephone or face to face conversations, such notes could be sole possession records depending on the nature and content of the notes.</p>

                          <p>A teacher personally witnesses an incident, such as one student bullying another. Can the teacher call the victim’s parents and tell them what she observed and who she saw bullying their child?</p> 
                          <p class="scenario_answer"> Yes. This is because FERPA prohibits the improper disclosure of information derived from education records. Therefore, information that is based on observation or hearsay and not specifically contained in education records would not be protected from disclosure under FERPA. </p>

                         <p>FERPA generally prohibits the nonconsensual disclosure of information derived from education records, except in certain specified circumstances. One of these exceptions permits the nonconsensual disclosure of information derived from education records to that student's parent if the student is a dependent student. Further, neither the age of the student nor the parent's status as custodial parent is relevant to determining whether disclosure of information from the education records of eligible students to a parent without written consent is permissible under FERPA. If a student is claimed as a dependent by either parent for tax purposes, then either parent may have access under this provision.</p>

                          <p>A student is claimed as a dependent student on his parents’ IRS tax form. However, the student has requested that the college not permit his parents to have access to his education records.

                          <p class="scenario_answer"> No. Although the disclosure of education records to parents of a dependent student is permissive and not required, the student cannot prevent the school from disclosing the records under this exception to consent or any other exception to consent listed in FERPA. </p>

                   <ol>
                    <li> political affiliations or beliefs of the student or the student’s parent;</li>

                   <p>PPRA also concerns marketing surveys and other areas of student privacy, parental access to information, and the administration of certain physical examinations to minors.&nbsp; The rights under PPRA transfer from the parents to a student who is 18 years old or an emancipated minor under State law.</p>

                   <p>In addition to the potential for loss of funds under ESEA noted above for failure to comply with § 9528 of the ESEA, an LEA that denies a military recruiter access to the requested information on students after July 1, 2002, will be subject to specific interventions under<br> 10 U.S.C. § 503. &nbsp;</p> 
                   <p> In this regard, the law requires that a senior military officer (e.g., Colonel or Navy Captain) visit the LEA within 120 days.&nbsp; If the access problem is not resolved with the LEA, the Department of Defense must notify the State Governor within 60 days.&nbsp; Problems still unresolved after one year are reported to Congress if the Secretary of Defense determines that the LEA denies recruiting access to at least two of the armed forces (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, etc.).&nbsp; The expectation is that public officials will work with the LEA to resolve the problem. &nbsp;</p> 
                   <p> Additionally, the Department of Defense has developed a national high school data base to document recruiter access.&nbsp; Presently, 95 percent of the nation’s 22,000 secondary schools provide a degree of access to military recruiters that is consistent with current law.&nbsp;</p>
