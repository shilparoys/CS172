    <p>The U.S. Department of Education awards about $150 billion every year to help millions of students pay for college. This federal student aid is awarded in the form of grants, work-study funds, and low-interest loans.</p> 
    <p><strong>Grants</strong> are typically awarded on the basis of need and generally do not have to be repaid. There are four types of federal student grants:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><strong>Federal Pell Grants</strong> are usually awarded to undergraduate students who have not yet earned a bachelor’s degree. (In some cases, students enrolled in postbaccalaureate teacher certification programs may receive Federal Pell Grants.) The maximum Federal Pell Grant award for the 2015-2016 award year is $5,550; however, the actual award depends on the student’s financial need, the college’s cost of attendance, the student’s enrollment status, and the length of the academic year in which the student is enrolled. Students can receive the Federal Pell Grant for up to the equivalent of 12 semesters.</li> 
     <li><strong>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG)</strong> are awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. The amount of the award is determined by the college’s financial aid office, and depends on the student’s financial need and the availability of funds at the college.</li> 
     <li><strong>Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants</strong> are awarded to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families. If the service requirement is not fulfilled, it could turn into a loan.</li> 
     <li><strong>Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants</strong> are awarded to students whose parents or guardians were members of the Armed Forces and died as a result of performing military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after Sept. 11, 2001. To qualify, a student must have been under 24 years of age or enrolled in college at the time of the parent’s or guardian’s death.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p><strong>The Federal Work-Study Program</strong> enables students to earn money during the school year while also gaining valuable work experience, typically in part-time, career-related jobs.</p> 
    <p><strong>Loans</strong> consist of money that the student borrows to help pay for college, and must be repaid (plus interest). There are two federal student loan programs:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>The <strong>Federal Perkins Loan Program</strong> is a campus-based program that provides low-interest loans to undergraduate and graduate students. The amount of the award depends on the student’s financial need, the amount of other aid the student receives, and the availability of funds at his/her college.</li> 
     <li>The <strong>William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program</strong> enables students and parents to borrow money at low interest rates directly from the federal government. The Direct Loan Program includes Direct Stafford Loans, which are available to undergraduate and graduate students, and Direct PLUS Loans, which are available to parents of dependent students and to graduate and professional-degree students. A Direct Stafford Loan might be subsidized or unsubsidized. Direct PLUS Loans are always unsubsidized. Subsidized loans are based on financial need and are available only to undergraduate students. The federal government pays the interest on subsidized loans while the borrower is in college and during deferment. Unsubsidized loans are based on the student's education costs and other aid received. The borrower must pay all accrued interest on unsubsidized loans.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p><strong>Other forms of financial aid</strong> that might be available to students include:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>State government aid. For more information, contact the state’s higher education agency. You can find the state agency’s contact information at <a href="JavaScript:ExternalSite('http://wdcrobcolp01.ed.gov/Programs/EROD/org_list.cfm?category_cd=SHE')">http://wdcrobcolp01.e d.gov/Programs/EROD/org_list.cfm?category_cd=SHE</a>.</li> 
     <li>Aid from the college. Students should contact the financial aid offices at the colleges they are considering for more information.</li> 
     <li>Scholarships. Some states, local governments, colleges, community organizations, private employers, and other organizations award scholarships based on academic ability or other factors.
