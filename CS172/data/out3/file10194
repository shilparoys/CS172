    <summary>Get ready for a long last blog post. I have some serious reflecting and sharing to do. I've spent my last week here sick. Most of campus has a cold, and in my attempts to spend time with as many people as I can in my last stretch of time here, it was inevitable that I too would get sick. Though it has slowed me down, it isn't the worst thing and I'm still smiling as much as ever. I had&amp;nbsp;my final goodbye lunch with Rick, Nicole, and Rob today at the Rainbow Cafe (the same place we went on my first day - symbolic? definitely) to talk about the fall and the future.&amp;nbsp;Rick gave me a signed copy of his Parameter Estimations and Inverse Problems textbook - a very thoughtful, and applicable, gift from the summer.&amp;nbsp;Tonight and tomorrow I have&amp;nbsp;all of my goodbyes with friends. Being a very sentimental person who is not the best at goodbyes, I've gotten cards and small silly gifts for people (example - a $4&amp;nbsp;giftcard to DQ for my friend Emily, just enough for a celebratory blizzard for the climbs I know she'll keep crushing after I leave). I am just so thankful for the people I've become good friends with - all motivated, hilarious, and incredibly kind people. They made my summer here unforgettable.&amp;nbsp;All that is left is the packing. It will&amp;nbsp;be too quick and easy, just a couple tubs of clothes and gear to shove into my car with my bike and crashpad, then on the open road. &amp;nbsp; Now to reflect on my project and this summer as an IRIS Intern -- We are supposed to evaluate our progress and reread our goals.&amp;nbsp;During the first third, there&amp;nbsp;was a lot of waiting. But I did feel like I had that time to understand the research and methodologies that I was going to pursue. I did not learn that much about different signals and characterizing them, but working with Nicole on OK earthquakes,&amp;nbsp;though a different type completely, did help me understand what I would be doing.&amp;nbsp;I created maps and tested my understanding with our communication project and writing the abstract for AGU with my advisor. I do feel like I have become familiar and proficient in my data processing, though I do still rely on Nicole for coding assistance and to talk through my plans.&amp;nbsp;Similarly, I feel more confident about being&amp;nbsp;self-guided and asking for help when I need it. I think I was kind of shocked into how necessary it is to develop that skill, especially when you are so new to research. I still feel it necessary to talk through a solid "to do list" with my advisor, but beyond that I enjoy being independent.&amp;nbsp;I have certainly made some professional contacts, and know will only continue to make more.&amp;nbsp;And finally, I have become much more informed about my post internship choices and feel much more confident about how I will pursue them. Overall,&amp;nbsp;I was a bit over-ambitious with hoping that everything would be done at the end and I would be reflecting and outlining papers. Definitely not the case.&amp;nbsp;Along those lines,&amp;nbsp;I will be continuing my research into the fall, completing my poster, focusing on my work with Marie Byrd Land, and then possibly beginning investigation into triggered icequakes if time allows (but if these 13 weeks are any indication, I doubt the 10+ weeks of fall quarter will be enough to do all I hope). Rick and I have also discussed writing up a paper from our summer research, which seems daunting right now with little produced. I think just using this technique to review a modern study, seeing it's application and ability to expand upon a catalog (especially one as patchy as in Antarctica), is quite impressive. Reading some of the other intern's retrospective blog posts, we all seem to have a common feeling about our futures and grad school: it's a big decision. I think this summer really showed us how incredible, but also how much work, research is. Not just in processing data and all the steps along the way, but how research is not inherently easy or clearly laid out for you. You do struggle. And you ultimately do need to have a certain desire motivating you. Therefore, a&amp;nbsp;PhD is a 6 year intense commitment that I know I am not ready to make. After talking to many people about pursuing a PhD, I've discovered it is something&amp;nbsp;that you need to know you want. Neither of my parents went to college, so though academics became very important to me, I never thought of going as far as getting my PhD. I never dreamed about being Dr. Myers. And right now, it makes me much more nauseated than excited. It brings on some pretty undeniable stress and feelings of unease. That's a pretty clear sign it's not for me, at least not right now. However, I have loved it here. There are moments where I am thrilled by my research and the research being done by others, especially working with the NEIC. It's still intimidating but the excitment I feel is definitely real. And so, I have had two developments arise towards the end of my research this summer... Dr.&amp;nbsp;Harley Benz, my advisor at the NEIC/USGS, proposed that I return in February, after I graduate in December and take some time off for myself in January, for an internship with them. I would&amp;nbsp;be continuing similar work to my summer research, but also be working on two new areas of data processing and multiple event location. I couldn't say no to this opportunity to get more experience, to work with Harley again (who has been just a riot and so supportive), and to return to Colorado so soon! Golden will be a fun place to live, smaller than Fort Collins, but with the same outdoor opportunities and only an hour and a half away from the wonderful friends I have made this summer. Paperwork is underway, and though there is a slight chance it could fall through with government budget, we are all quite confident this will fall into place! I also met with my advisor at CSU, Dr.&amp;nbsp;Rick Aster, about graduate school possibilities a couple weeks ago. After discussing my fears of diving straight into a PhD, he fully supported the option of going for Master's first. That can then lead to many choices - stopping after completing my MS, changing institutions for my PhD, or continuing on for my PhD at the same institution. Hearing his support, and being on the CSU campus as school started back up again, made me incredibly excited about grad school again. 3 years is much more manageable. So this fall I will be applying to a few schools and&amp;nbsp;I am happy to say&amp;nbsp;that CSU will be one of them! The opportunity to move back here next summer after my internship in Golden is something that appeals greatly to me. The area, the research, and the people are all things I know I want to be a part of. And the fact that this decision feels much more right, less daunting, makes me less nervous about my future. &amp;nbsp; ​And so it comes to a close. What is it they say about when one door closes...? I have never felt like the end of something could&amp;nbsp;bring&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;much opportunity as this. I am so grateful and can't help wondering, is this the end or the beginning?</summary>

    <title>Crunch Time - Weeks 10 &amp;amp; 11 - Emma Myers</title>

    <summary>Where has the time gone?! Tuesday was the end of my 11th week. Two weeks from Wednesday I will be headed out on my drive home - with the specific pit stop at Arches National Park with one of my dear friends Katie. I told her if she bought a one way ticket to Denver that I would drive us back to Washington - good deal right? As the last intern left, I'm finally understanding what they all talked about - it surely, and sadly,&amp;nbsp;flies by at the end.&amp;nbsp;Things have been chugging along as normal, spurts of intense work blended into the more constant stream of slow progress. Nicole and I had a WebEx&amp;nbsp;meeting with our advisor down at the NEIC Wednesday to talk about progress and plans for the next steps. It seems like it is always easier to make a list of things to do than to actually cross things off. It seems like we can always add to it, and that each component is actually made up of a small list itself.&amp;nbsp; Our current plan is as follows: 1. Use the velocity model and traveltime picks from Amanda's (Lough et al) Maire Byrd Land paper, and relocate her existing catalog useing BayesLoc. BayesLoc is based upon Bayesian statistics (I've been reading a lot about, and understanding much less), which involves probabilistic&amp;nbsp;computations from the velocity model (travel time predictions), the phase picks, and the station data (all prior constraints) to generate a sample of locations consistent with observations while also evaluating the correctness of utilized models and providing error bars to those locations. Relocating her catalog provides a good benchmark for the events that I will be detecting with the subspace detector code. 2. Each YT station is processed with particular parameters. These were discussed in my last blog entry... I do not have too much to change about what I discussed. I did settle on using Amanda's filtering parameters so that this will be a more consistent comparison/extension of her project. Template length does indeed change with each station, with the distance from the source, so that is chosen individually. Correlation threshold, however, has been improved! We have been trying to create a more statistically robust reasoning behind our choice of threshold, and Harley has developed something that I think is quite wonderful! We are still comparing signal to noise with randomly generated, Gaussian noise, but we are looking more critically at the statistics of the distribution. I'm still tryign to figure out how to explain it (must mean I don't understand it all quite yet), but it's related to Gaussian distributions having a mean centered at zero and the number of standard distributions (sigma) to represent that distribution... That was a poor attempt, I'll try to improve my AGU. Anyway, looking at an example day of our data, it appears that 5 sigma is a statistically consistent choice that defines a threshold adding little noise, but picking up most signal. This will mean that we will want to look at the false alarm rate, when an event picked is truly noise. However we expect this to be quite small, and the work it would take to write a code to fix this is beyond our scope right now. 3. Use the subspace detector to find all detections for each of the 6 stations over Amanda's 2010-2011 time period. (Don't be fooled by the little I wrote on this step - this is big plug and chug, exciting step!) 4. All station results collated into a single file, new events are associated with the previous catalog to be relocated. Relocation again? Well yes! With many more events, we will want to see how these distribute across the locations we find in the first BayesLoc run. Associating the events will run them across each station to see at how many stations the same event is picked. I should be getting Amanda's pick tables this afternoon, that way I can get everything ready for processing at each station, while also learning how to generate the inputs for BayesLoc. Harley keeps saying the program is "stupidly easy" - and it does appear that way, but it's always understanding the background that complicates things. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I'm getting pretty sad about leaving Fort Collins, and Colorado in general. I have definitely grown to love it here. Each week only got better and better. Highlights from these past two? Well I went to Rifle for an amazing clinic with Glenwood Climbing Guides and the author of The Vertical Mind on the mental side of climbing, managing to get match&amp;nbsp;my hardest sport onsight from last season then immediately do my newest hardest onsight yet, all&amp;nbsp;while in the company of some truly wonderful people. I know I will go back to Rifle for some more limestone climbing in the future. The next day I was back at Rocky Mountain National Park. I sent my second v6, which is my hardest bouldering grade thus far, with my good friends Jed and Emily. It was both of their first v6's and I was incredibly glad to be there to see them succeed. Emily and I also sent our first v7's this past weekend at the park - on a day that I didn't think I'd climb let alone send my hardest boulder&amp;nbsp;problem yet. I adore climbing with her, another short crusher girl with my same goofy humor and positive attitude, competition free, just out to have fun - a friend for the ages.&amp;nbsp;A new friend, Ryan, who came out to climb with us at the park, explained that days like these had to be celebrated with a DQ blizzard - so we all sat on the curb, devouring our well deserved Pumpkin Pie (Apple for Ryan) blizzards in the last bit of summer sun.&amp;nbsp;This past weekend was also New Belgium's Tour de Fat, which we dressed up for and biked downtown with 25,000 other crazies&amp;nbsp;for ample beer and&amp;nbsp;dancing. The next day,&amp;nbsp;I took myself out on some belated hikes near Fort Collins - Horsetooth Rock and Grayrock. Both of which were beautiful, and I was able to run most of each trail. A long, but invigorating day with gorgeous views (Grayrock's meadow trail pictured above). It all ended with a fun barbecue at my friend Mo's house. So many new climbing friends, all incredibly supportive and fun people - it makes me sad to leave when I feel like I only just&amp;nbsp;met a lot of them... At least it won't be long before I see them again... (What does that mean? Stay tuned for the next blog post - one you won't want to miss!)</summary>

    <summary>This had to be the fastest summer of my entire life.&amp;nbsp; Where did these four months go??!&amp;nbsp; I can't believe that this is my last week here in Chapel Hill, and that I'm flying straight back to school on Saturday morning.&amp;nbsp; Time flies when your days are full, but I wouldn't have it any other way.&amp;nbsp; My internship this summer challenged me in ways I hadn't been challenged before, and I am so happy that I was chosen to join the IRIS community. Before I leave, though, there's still plenty more to do.&amp;nbsp; Last week I focused on running a cross-correlations on my data in order to create groups of similar waveforms and perform a cluster analysis for each year.&amp;nbsp; Jonathan gave me a bunch of code to figure out, which took me a while to get through.&amp;nbsp; After playing around with it for a bit, I was able to use it to read in all my events, remove any that may be repeats not caught through the previous round of sorting, and compare the shape of the acoustic wave with all others that year.&amp;nbsp; The code produces a correlation coefficient, which is then used to create clusters of events that are statistically similar.&amp;nbsp; In R, I'm using a function called hclust(), which stands for hierarchichal cluster analysis.&amp;nbsp; I spent quite a while researching this topic, both on the internet and in some statistics and data analysis textbooks, and the methods behind it are pretty confusing and complex.&amp;nbsp; Basically, it just means that I'm making groups--however many I choose--of my data based on which signals look similar.&amp;nbsp; This uses a top-down approach, where you start with one large group of waveforms and divide it into clusters that are more or less like each other.&amp;nbsp; Each cluster is further divided until you've reached the point where all the data is grouped, which can be illustrated with a large dendrogram plot like this: These are all the good events saved from 2010 (the sparsest year--easiest to see what's going on) grouped through hierarchical cluster analysis.&amp;nbsp; The "Height" label on the y-axis is the correlation coefficient, so the groups that are higher up on the plot are more alike.&amp;nbsp; From here, I split all of these into 6 different groups: Now it's clear to see that each individual event fits into a group that is statiscally "alike."&amp;nbsp; I've been going through each of the grouped events to see what they have in common and whether or not I can make any connections between the groups (which are sorted based on their waveforms--explosions will have different waveforms than thunder or mineblasts, for example) and where they're located on the stereonet (which is based on my original function to calculate arrival incidence vectors). This week I'm continuing what I was doing last week...diving through my data looking for correlations or patterns or really anything that can help me better understand and predict the sources of these infrasound events.&amp;nbsp; I've written codes to analyze the data in all different ways, comparing stereonet positions with cross correlation data, going back and looking at the original waveforms I made my picks on, extracting the dates and times from each of the events to see whether they occurred on weekdays or weekends, during working hours or late at night, etc.&amp;nbsp; Mostly, I'd like to know more about the signals that have weird inclinations, or come from an azimuth angle for which there is no predicted/obvious source.&amp;nbsp; With Danny's help, I'm trying to get a hold of someone who can provide a record of all mine blasts in New Mexico during these years--maybe a lot of these are coming from far-off mines.&amp;nbsp; I've taken extensive notes as I've been going through my data, and am sad to say I haven't found anything extraordinary yet.&amp;nbsp; And maybe I won't--it's something Jonathan and I have been talking about a lot recently, that maybe, after all of this, I won't be able to produce some clear, groundbreaking conclusion accurately solving for all infrasound sources in the area.&amp;nbsp; There are so many factors that could affect the signals before they reach the array, so I can't expect to have all the answers, no matter how long I spend analyzing the data.&amp;nbsp; It's a little frustrating, but I plan on moving forward with it and putting together the most comprehensive poster I can. I will definitely have more work to do once I get back to Yale--I have to make the poster, finalize my conclusions, and I would like to turn all of this work into a paper, which is going to be a serious challenge seeing as how I'll also be working on my senior thesis this year.&amp;nbsp; However, I love that I had a chance to experience an entirely new field of geophysics research this summer, and I feel like, for the first time, this project is truly mine.&amp;nbsp; Sure, it's a little rough right now, and Jonathan could have probably produced the same results I achieved this summer in just a few weeks on his own, but I am proud of it.&amp;nbsp; It has been invaluable participating in the research process firsthand from start to finish.&amp;nbsp; I'm still just as (if not more) confused on whether or not I will pursue a Ph.D. program, but I do feel like I have learned an enormous amount about what it's like to be a research scientist.</summary>

    <title>Decisions, decisions, decisions - Weeks 8, 9 - Emma Myers</title>

    <summary>The ebb and flow of research continues. I'm coming to learn we are all trying to figure it out together, you begin by pursuing one path, then find something interesting and follow it, usually stopped by having to make some difficult decisions. The easy part is getting carried away, thinking about all the things you want to do with your data, once those vital steps have been taken. At a certain point, you have to just make a decision, and move on. What excatly do I mean? Well for my project, creating a catalog of the subspace detected events requires specific parameters to be chosen: filtering, correlation thresholds, template lengths, the reference event/configuration file of events, etc. Each of these change the amount of detections, the number of templates, and the correlation coefficient values - so it's a troublesome to try to weigh what is important, while also what is statistically relevant and proper representation of the data. What is worse is further complications by the fact that many of these values should not be set permanently, but change with the frequency of events, the station (distance from sites), etc. &amp;nbsp; Filtering We are trying to look at noise (blue) vs. event signal (red) to find where the best high and low frequency cut offs should be for filtering (roughly where they cross). Too small of a window and everything looks alike, too low and we miss the high frequency events, etc. Above is a plot of events added together for an average look at the signal to noise, and it appears the best range is aboiut 1-11 Hz, with some random peaks inbetween. For my eye, it is easiest to see events clearly around 2-4Hz filtering in gsac (a great tool for plotting seismic data). But I can't just pick what "looks best" I have to have a reason for why I choose the filtering I do. Honestly, I think I may use the filtering parameters from the Lough et al paper that I'm basing a lot of this primary research on (1.5-4Hz, 4 poles). &amp;nbsp; Correlation Threshold/Scaling Factor So similar to looking at noise vs event relationships, Harley and Rick had been looking at empirical noise for determining a correlation threshold. This is the coefficient for which anything above we will consider a true, honest event, and for all below, is likely noise, or so lost in the noise that it will be hard to tell. Here are to images of days of activity during one of the swarms in Marie Byrd Land I'm looking at. The black is just correlation coefficients plotted with time, showing the highly active, many event day on 1/22 and then showing the much fewer distinct events on 2/11. The red is also correlation with time, but not of the raw data, instead Harley has developed the code to generate a random noise stream that still has the spectral shape of true data. We can see that it does fit the noise floor very well, only spiking up into the events occasionally. So this is pretty amazing - whereas before we were picking a correlation coefficient as a default for the whole time, this clearly shows that the threshold needs to change with time. The code will then run through, and for example, I set it to run 10 min of every hour - it finds the maximum value for the noise correlation coefficient, multiplies it by a scaling factor so that we set the threshold above the noise, and then applies that as the new threshold for the rest of the hour, recalculating at the beginning of each hour. This is especially important for the highly active days, or for farther, noisier stations. Seems pretty easy huh? What is there to decide? Well, I need to decide by what value I want the maximum threshold recorded to be multiplied - the "scaling factor." Too high and I will be missing what are real events, too low and I will risk taking in too much noise... Right now we are playing with a scaling factor of 1.5, but I think we can do lower. &amp;nbsp; Template Length Here, I am to decided the length of the templates. My stations are quite far from the source area, and so I must do a longer template. If I only did a couple seconds, almost anythign could be picked up as an "event," so I must think of incorporating the important parts that define an event as a true event - phase arrivals. It must be long enough to include both the P and S wave arrivals, which are shown above. Including noise before and into the coda is also important, because to have events highly correlate that are truly the same, the event would be correlated through until the coda dies back into the noise. I have chosen to not go to that far, including the important phase arrivals and some of the coda. I think this can be justified as sufficient, and I think I will be sticking with this length (at least one decision made!). &amp;nbsp; Outdoor Recreation Finally, these past two weeks have been great fun outside! I have made it out to Rocky Mountain National Park to boulder a few times and highly recommend it as a must see for anyone passing through. There are hoards of tourists, and they love to ask about the "funny mattresses" we are carrying into the woods. My friend Jenny came to visit this past weekend, we climbed some sport at Clear Creek Canyon (shown above) and then got out to the park on Sunday. It was nice to have her around, even though it was a whirlwind weekend. Only one month left! Hoping to start cranking things out with these decisions, and begin work on my poster soon. With the other interns mostly done, save a few, I hope I won't be blogging to no one. Regardless, I will be able to share everything at AGU in December!</summary>

    <summary>It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of the end. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s the first day of my last week in Seattle. I&amp;rsquo;m actually feeling really optimistic about this coming week. I tend to feel overwhelmed when a project of this size comes to a close, but I&amp;rsquo;m surprisingly calm. It may have something to do with the fact that my project won&amp;rsquo;t be over after I leave, but I think a large part of it comes from how supportive everyone has been. It&amp;rsquo;s been a relief to work with people who know how difficult and intimidating research can be, especially as an undergrad. Although I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my research here at UW, there are a lot of other things going on in my head. I want to finish this summer strong because I am pretty worried about the semester to come. I will be a senior, which means I will have to make some major life decisions. After my internship last summer I was unsure about whether I wanted to attend grad school and after this summer, I&amp;rsquo;m still unsure. I have been going to school my whole life, and it has always been my priority. I can&amp;rsquo;t count how many times my grandma has asked me how I can still be going to school. Pursuing a PhD is a major commitment. Everyone I talk to agrees, it has to be something you know you want because there will be times when your commitment is tested. Five to seven years of research isn&amp;rsquo;t something you do just because you don&amp;rsquo;t know what else to do. I respect and admire people who have PhDs, but I still don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can be one of them. Another cause of my stress is the upcoming AGU conference. It is the good kind of stress that is both exciting and scary. I can usually feel when something is going to be a big event in my life and AGU is one of them. At the very least, it will help me decide what I want to do after I graduate. It will also be great to reunite with all the people I&amp;rsquo;ve met this summer. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>I have just finished the last day of my internship here at MIT. Even though I am leaving, I am certainly not done. I spent a lot of time this week preparing my codes and data for me to work on them remotely. I have enough for a solid presentation now, but adding even more correlations makes things clearer and better, so I will continue to run more data between now and AGU. Looking back, this internship has been amazing. I learned a lot about seismology, computers, research, and life this summer, and it has made a big impact on how I think about my future. I have known for a long time that science is the path for me, but was previously somewhat unsure about whether I would do well in a research career. I was also nervous about being totally on my own, because I had never lived anywhere but Lincoln, Nebraska before. After this summer, though, both of those concerns have been greatly alleviated; I definitely want to go to graduate school and work toward a career in geophysics. My confidence in this path has been building slowly all summer, but it really hit home when the postdoc with whom I have been working told me that he has been very impressed by me this summer and thinks I have a bright future in geophysics. I am excited to return to Nebraska and see my home, family, and friends again soon, but I will definitely miss it here; MIT is a great place for a nerd like me to be!</summary>

    <summary>Last week was a big relief after having the AGU abstract weigh on my shoulders all summer. Although I would have liked more time with the data before the abstract was due, I&amp;rsquo;m happy with what I submitted. I have also been assured by AGU veterans that because the abstracts are due so much earlier than the conference itself, people will not be surprised if the presentations have a slightly different subject. I will be finished with the bulk of my project this summer, but I will get to keep working after I head home. Right now the duration of data ranges from 2-3 weeks , depending on which site it&amp;rsquo;s from. There will be another service run in October that will give me enough data to determine the orientation of the majority of the sensors. My advisor and I have also been discussing other possible analyses I could do with the data over the next semester. Being a part of iMUSH and getting to be one of the first people to look at this data has been really exciting. I received a password that allows me to access the data through the IRIS-DMC (Data Management Center) and I will admit that it makes me feel pretty fancy. Although I have access to the data through the DMC, it is more convenient to download the data from the local server. After I get the data, I get to play around with it in my code. The most fulfilling part of this has been confirming some of the expectations we had about the data. There were a few things that my advisor noticed when he was working with the data that I was also able to confirm with my code. Without more data my code isn&amp;rsquo;t very statistically significant, but it has been able to confirm the expected orientations in general. In slightly unrelated news, I have decided to declare geophysics as a second major. I have no idea why I never thought to research it before, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy I finally did. I have my slightly stubborn personality and the increasing popularity of geophysics to thank. I wanted to sign up for this really interesting class, but was unable to add it because I&amp;rsquo;m not a senior geophysics major. After a brief time of feeling defeated, I decided to do a little research. I found that I&amp;rsquo;ve already taken a vast majority of the required classes and two of my upper division physics courses will transfer. The next two semesters may be a little busy, but I think the pros will outweigh the cons. It has been a great summer and although I still have some time left, I can feel things wrapping up. My advisor has also noticed my time is coming to a close. In honor of this, he has decided that I should present my project to the grad students in the building. I&amp;rsquo;m not as bad at public speaking as I once was, but it still makes me nervous. My biggest issue is the fact that there is no feedback in the middle of a presentation. I tutored for several years so I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable explaining things, I&amp;rsquo;m just not comfortable when I&amp;rsquo;m the only one allowed to talk. I prefer knowing when someone has no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m saying so I can adapt what I&amp;rsquo;m saying, and presentations make that really hard. Yet I know how important it is to be able to present your research well, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to get over my nerves and take it as a learning experience. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>Today is the first workday of the final week of the internship. From 2 August until now, I have wandered to and fro around Albuquerque, as intern housing ended two weeks before my internship did. This has not prevented me from trekking to the Physics and Astronomy Building to savor the speedy internet and tunnel into the Lithos server, where I run MATLAB and essentially do all my work. As far as that has gone: it forced me to make the leap in problem solving required for graduate education. I spent much of the first half of the internship without a clear picture addressed internally or externally to what the project would amount. As Robert Heinlein said, "in the absence of clearly-defined goals, we become strangely loyal to performing daily trivia until ultimately we become enslaved bt it." Correspondence revolved around making minute steps in MATLAB coding and awaiting the go-ahead for another step. Around the halfway point, the path which the rest of the summer would follow became more apparent, and while I remain in close touch with my advisor, I am better able to treat the internship as an opportunity to proactively explore my own ways of approaching problems. Nonetheless, I remain in close collaboration with my advisor in abstract composition and poster design, for the project involves a great deal of her efforts as well: a framework in Python to generate the models, pointers on my incipient MATLAB codes, requests for the model specifications, et cetera. Graduate school is an eventuality. A B.S. in physics and math teaches abstract engineering, and provides the same relative opportunities as a B.A. in English. I still must reflect on where my desires and abilities converge best.</summary>

    <summary>Although I have been home for about a week now, I have been so busy with family obligations and jury duty that&amp;nbsp;I am just writing this blog post now. Who knew I would be just as busy being back at home as I was during the internship. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when you live in a full house and you have to help your little sister, who will be a freshman in college, shop for school and dorm room supplies. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe my internship is over; it went by a lot quicker than I thought it would. There was so much I learned this summer from meeting so many people throughout the summer. Not only did I learn so much about seismology and data managing and processing, but I also learned how to be more independent and also to be more confident in myself and my work. Being away from home, from family, and friends, and living in a completely different environment has really showed me how independent I could be. So, now as I think about graduate school, I am not as scared about living away from home and on my own. Going into this internship, I felt like I was in way over my head, I knew very little about geophysics, seismology, and computer programming. I chose to apply to this internship because my university does not offer any courses related to seismology and I wanted to explore my interests that I have in this field. To be honest, I felt intimidated the first few weeks of my internship. I was learning so much information all at once and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if I could keep up with all of it. But as I started to settle down and talk to my mentor, I felt better about what I would be doing this summer. This summer I was able to learn GMT (I made 3 figures for my poster using GMT), which I thought I would not be able to do because GMT seemed so daunting when it was first introduced to me. Now that m summery internship experience with IRIS is coming to an end, I was able to submit my abstract to AGU and complete my poster for AGU. During the last week of my internship I presented my poster to the group of graduate students and undergraduate students that my&amp;nbsp;mentor advises. They gave me some&amp;nbsp;feedback and it was also good practice for me before&amp;nbsp;AGU.&amp;nbsp;I can definitely say that I have learned and gained so much experience this summer, from meeting new people and networking at the IRIS workshop in Oregon to completing seismological research to learning how to cook healthy and balanced meals for my housemates and myself.</summary>

    <summary>Only one week is remaining for me at MIT! I have been trying my hardest this week to begin wrapping things up for my departure. I set up my remote access to the computer that I have been using here, so I can keep using our 64-core cluster to correlate and stack more data even after I return to Nebraska. I will also save much of the completed data and the codes I have written on a flash drive so that I can create figures and other things for my poster later. I picked a &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo; out of the procedures that I have been testing, so I will continue to process more data with (drumroll, please) the amplitude-based sorting system, instead of with the comparisons to the earthquake catalog. My group and I are still a little confused as to why sorting by amplitude works better; I think it might be due to non-earthquake events that cause high-amplitude data, such as storms. &amp;nbsp; After much editing, re-editing, and re-re-editing, I finally called it good on my abstract for the AGU meeting and clicked the &amp;ldquo;submit&amp;rdquo; button. As I have been learning more throughout the summer, I have been growing more and more excited for AGU. The meeting is still four long, homework-filled months away, and I will probably grow yet more excited as it draws nearer. I have also been rushing to get as much of a fun Boston experience as possible before I leave. Last weekend, I sat in a Fenway Park seat (I did not actually attend a Red Sox game; the seat was an old one, taken out during a renovation, that a pizza place bought to put inside of their Sox-themed restaurant), saw an early typeset printing of the Declaration of Independence at the Museum of Fine Arts, and browsed the fancy boutiques of Newbury Street.</summary>

    <summary>This week has been pretty hectic. I had written my AGU abstract, got it checked by my mentor, and submitted it, uncharacteristically, ahead of time. Things seemed really good until we took another look at my inversion result. William had a really keen eye in noticing that the bathymetry was off. We scratched our heads for a while and found that I was not inverting with the proper offset, but when that result came out it was even stranger. I worked with Dax to troubleshoot the issue- it was important to figure out the problem since my abstract was possibly based off an incorrect model. Just as the deadline was approaching we discovered the sneaky problem. While we were at sea the starting model was not present in the database so we needed to send it so I could work on it. However, the internet is very weak and the model is quite large so in order to transport it William wrote a nice bit of code to compress it. When we came back from sea I forgot all about the changes to the model. We figured out the problem, fixed it, and ran an inversion that produced a model that was free of any problems- basically the starting model was only slightly off because the data was &amp;lsquo;shrinked&amp;rsquo; while we were at sea. With my new model we ran a forward problem to produce a synthetic PmP model to help me pick in areas that are difficult, and to refine my already existing picks. I will then be able to produce better inversion results all the way up to AGU.</summary>

    <summary>First and foremost, I am really really really sorry for how poorly I have maintained this blog over the past month. I am not really sure what came over me, but blogging kind of fell on the backburner as of late. Anyways, here is what I have been doing since July 3. Sheesh! Once I finished sifting through all of the S traces, I then had to perform a bulk time shift for all of the traces for each event to account for time delays between stations. When that was finished the script created a receiver function for each trace and then sorted all of the receiver functions by station. I then had to go through and edit these receiver functions, throwing out ones that had bad or nonexistent Moho signals. At this point the data was ready for CCP stacking and I pretty much just sat back and let Matlab do its thing. Except not really. There were some issues with my computer not having a Matlab mapping toolbox, but in the end we were able to download some replacements off of the interwebs that worked just fine. When I was able to finally look at the CCP images there was definitely something strange going on. Long story short, there did not seem to be any data for the top half of my study region. After some detective work, I realized that somehow half of my stations did not make it through the CCP calculations and that my station coverage looked like this: If I had had another month or so at USC, then I would have delved deeper into this mystery, but limited time forced me to let the issue go. Luckily there was still a lot going on in the region that did have data that I could work with. Back at the ranch, my P receiver function finally finished and I was able to start the joint inversion using this data and the surface dispersion data. For the sake of time, Rob and I changed the number of iterations from something like 29 to 7. We also split up the stations so that Rob could run the code for half of the stations on his computer and my computer would handle the other half. In the end it took a couple of days for all of the stations to be finished. Unfortunately, once I looked at the finished data it did not really make much sense: there were weird slow velocity pockets directly over the Yellowstone Hotspot and the overall velocity gradients looked random and patchy. In the end we are thinking that maybe we did not perform enough iterations to produce reliable data. Once again, if I would have had another month at USC, then I would have redone the joint inversion code with all of the 29 itereations, but time was not on my side. Since the joint inversion data was not looking reliable, I decided to use the surface wave dispersion data instead. At this point I was ready to interpret my CCP and surface wave dispersion data! I decided to focus on the western and southern borders of the Wyoming Province, because they are sutures from the early formation of the North American continent. Below is a map of my study area. I have never taken a tectonics class or any geology class that has focused on such large-scale processes and earth dynamics, so Rob&amp;rsquo;s and Leland&amp;rsquo;s advice/help/input was invaluable. (I am planning on putting this map on my AGU poster for the regional background section. All of the different provinces are outlined, shaded and colored and the Yellowstone Hotspot track is shown moving through the Wyoming Province with caldera ages listed in Ma. The inset in the bottom left corner gives a more general idea of where my study area is within the US.) Then came my last day at the office. I was really sad when I started cleaning out my desk and setting up my computer so that I could remotely access my computer at USC, because it started to hit me that I was not coming back in the morning. I said my goodbyes to some people in the office and some people later that night when Eagle Freedom took flight. All in all it was a very bittersweet day. Now I am at home in Seattle, having submitted my AGU abstract yesterday (the title of this blog post). Looking back this whole experience has been such a blast: meeting everyone and making friends at New Mexico Tech, getting to USC and finally realizing what I had gotten myself into, watching world cup (Columbia why????????), going to the beach, watching Dodger&amp;rsquo;s games, Sharkeez, reconnecting with old friends, making new friends, learning the hard way how not to get your wallet stolen, fighting with Matlab, loving Matlab, learning my way around a computer, and, last but not least, SCIENCE. Over the past two months I feel as if I have taken crash courses in computer science, seismology, wave theory, and tectonics and have learned more than I could have ever expected. Yesterday I also bought a GRE study book, so I guess you could say I am applying to grad school! I definitely did not see myself typing that last sentence a year ago, but this internship has showed me all of the possibilities that grad school can offer me and how much more there is to learn. A big thank you to Meghan, Rob, Leland, Doayuan, Cooper, and Amber for showing me your work and letting me show you mine every week; it was really great to work with all of you! See y&amp;rsquo;all at AGU! Cheers! Carolyn</summary>

    <summary>Alright, now comes the final push before heading back to Connecticut. &amp;nbsp;To be honest, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed this week by everything that needs to get done and everything I need to catch up on. &amp;nbsp;But, I started off the week in a good way: the day after I got back, I came into the lab just so I could submit my abstract for AGU, which felt so so good. &amp;nbsp;It's crazy just seeing my name as the first author of something, and it's nice being able to produce something meaningful out of everything I've done the last few months. &amp;nbsp;Now I'm trying to pick up on the momentum I left with so I can do some cool stuff with my data. &amp;nbsp;So far I have stereonet plots of all the infrasound sources I've been able to determine throughout the five years of data. &amp;nbsp;I can see distinct groups of signals, one of which clearly corresponds with the location of EMRTC (the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center), which detonates regular explosions and is expected to be the most prominent source of infrasound received at the array. This is just a screenshot of the three years where the infrasound sensors were running noise-free. &amp;nbsp;Each plotted point represents a "celerity" vector that I've calculated using the arrival time differences amongst the three stations in the array. &amp;nbsp;These incidence vectors show where the sound wave is coming from in relation to the array. &amp;nbsp;In a stereonet plot, the azimuth angle is simply the angle (0 to 360) around the plot where the inclination goes from 0 (on the horizon, along the ground) at the edge of the circle to 90 (directly overhead) in the center. &amp;nbsp;Plotting all three years over each other shows some serious correlation--there is one dominant direction (EMRTC), and a few other locations of common sources. The distribution of impulsive events is best represented in a histogram. &amp;nbsp;Here you can clearly see where the most dominant sources are in terms of azimuth angle with respect to the array. With all of this information, I want to go through and make some connections--what do these groups of signals have in common? &amp;nbsp;For the signals not coming from EMRTC--where are they being produced? &amp;nbsp;Are their directions a product of refraction in the stratosphere or some other atmospheric effect? &amp;nbsp;Even further, what do the signals themselves have in common? &amp;nbsp;Jonathan has given me a cross-correlation code to play around with in the coming weeks where I can group signals that are physically similar (where the wiggles have the same shape). &amp;nbsp;If I know the types of signals coming from an unknown source, this could help me narrow down where they're coming from. Before I left, I started playing around with grouping signals. &amp;nbsp;In R, I have utilized a program that lets me draw a polygon around a group and just view the information (date, time, etc.) of those signals. I guess you could say I'm playing detective from here on out. &amp;nbsp;Besides the cross-correlation program, I would also like to investigate atmospheric effects, so, with help from Jonathan, Danny, and Kyle Jones at Sandia, I plan on using a ray-tracing program on my data. &amp;nbsp;With this I should be able to more accurately source the signals taking into account the structure of the atmosphere on a given day and my calculated "celerity" vectors. &amp;nbsp;I'm really not sure yet how it's all going to come together, so the next few weeks are going to be all about learning, experimenting, and manipulating lots of code (once I understand the code, that is).</summary>

    <title>A Month of Canned Food and Dust - Tierney Larson</title>

    <summary>Living in the Namibian bush for a month has truly been the most eye-opening, perspective-changing, absolutely incredible experience I have had. &amp;nbsp;I just got back Sunday afternoon and am still a little jet-lagged and a lot culture-shocked. &amp;nbsp;Overall the trip went extremely smoothly--we collected plenty of samples for my project and didn't get a single flat tire, which is nothing short of amazing since everything is covered in thorns. &amp;nbsp;I went just over three weeks without using my phone or accessing the internet, which was so refreshing (even though I was greeted with 600+ e-mails to deal with come August). &amp;nbsp;Camping every night and working hard every day was extremely rewarding, even though some days I was definitely feeling exhausted. &amp;nbsp;I learned how to drop-start and use the drill, which is basically a huge chainsaw with the blade taken off and replaced by a diamond-bit rock drill...so I felt pretty cool. &amp;nbsp;Being in the field, I learned so much, not only about geology, but also about myself. &amp;nbsp;Through a rolled ankle, a day of nasty dehydration, and some serious sunburn, I've come away feeling both stronger and more knowledgeable, and I have too many stories to share in one blog post. The trip was great because I feel like I really saw the whole country. &amp;nbsp;We started with sampling in the North, right on the border with Angola, where it was burning hot during the day and nearly freezing at night. &amp;nbsp;It's crazy because we would go from working in serious desert, where everything is brown and dusty and thorny, to camping near a river, which serves as an oasis with palm trees, huge flowers, and flourishing life. &amp;nbsp;I climbed mountains while baboons barked at us to look out over stunning quarzite cliffs, covered in baobab trees. &amp;nbsp;I walked down ancient riverbeds to find nearly perfect exposures of rocks over one billion years old. &amp;nbsp;I stood in a sodalite quarry with huge pieces of bright blue minerals shining in the sun. &amp;nbsp;I struggled to interact with villagers who spoke absolutely no English--some were kind and showed us their village so we could ask permission from the head man to do our sampling, while others simply stared and followed us around as if we were the most exciting thing they've ever seen. &amp;nbsp;I went days without showering and slept on the ground with scorpions under the brightest, most gorgeous night sky. &amp;nbsp;The sunsets and sunrises in northern Namibia were my favorite parts of each day--I honestly felt like I was living in a National Geographic documentary. At around the halfway point of our trip we drove south to sample some new formations. &amp;nbsp;As a quick break from the physical work, we stopped at Etosha National Park, which is a massive wildlife reserve area. &amp;nbsp;We spent a day just driving around from watering hole to watering hole, where we saw almost every animal imaginable. &amp;nbsp;We were lucky enough to spot a cheetah and both a lion and lioness. &amp;nbsp;I saw elephants rip down a tree, rhinos hobbling around, zebra and wildebeest walking down the middle of the road, and even a few awkward ostrich. &amp;nbsp;It was such an unreal experience--a much-needed break from sampling. &amp;nbsp;Continuing our drive we passed through the capital city, Windhoek, once again. &amp;nbsp;We had a few problems with our drills overheating, and Windhoek is really the only "big" city in Namibia, so it was necessary to make a stop. &amp;nbsp;The contrast between bustling downtown Windhoek and the beat down villages of the North was shocking to say the least. &amp;nbsp;The city is very westernized with big shopping malls, gas stations, and grocery stores, where everything is ridiculously cheap (including the fantastic South African wine). &amp;nbsp;It was our chance to snag some (kind of) fresh vegetables before heading back into the land of canned food and red meat. Driving south, we crossed the Tropic of Capricorn, and, although we were still in the desert, it was suddenly cold all day. &amp;nbsp;Nights were below freezing, but luckily we met some farmers who let us stay in a little bunk house for the week. &amp;nbsp;Going from extreme hot to extreme cold was a little challenging, but it was great to see a new landscape and meet such a kind family. &amp;nbsp;They invited us to dinner twice--the first time we had a South African fish called snook, which is traditionally served on fresh baked bread with jam and is surprisingly good. &amp;nbsp;The second time we had beef...that had been shot, hung up on a tree, and slaughtered the day before right outside the house. &amp;nbsp;Each morning we would get up, eat breakfast, then get tackled by the huge, loving farm dogs on our way out. &amp;nbsp;There was a lot of hiking in search of perfect sites, but we used each day to the fullest and found some great areas. &amp;nbsp;Just as our work was finishing up that week, though, I started to have terrible sensitivity to the sun. &amp;nbsp;I had been taking malaria pills all month, which my travel nurse told me that I may experience the side effect of increased sensitivity to sunlight. &amp;nbsp;Each day it got worse and worse--I was putting on sunscreen 3 times a day and wearing long sleeves and still looked like a tomato. &amp;nbsp;I decided to stop taking the pills (so let's hope I don't get malaria), but not before I got some terrible third degree burns on my hands. &amp;nbsp;But hey, maybe they'll turn into badass scars. I feel like I was gone much more than a month with how busy we were each day. &amp;nbsp;There is so much more I could say about the experience, but now it's time to get back to my IRIS internship and the work I have left to wrap up in the next three weeks before school starts again. &amp;nbsp;In my next post I'll share some images I meant to share before I left--I'm finally to the point where I'm working on drawing conclusions from my data, which is super exciting. &amp;nbsp;It's a little overwhelming how much I have to do in the coming weeks, but after climbing through thorns up the side of a mountain carrying a rock drill, I think I can handle it.</summary>

    <summary>Today I was finally able to submit my abstract! &amp;nbsp; This has been a wonderful experience working here. &amp;nbsp;I can say without a doubt that I have never learned so much, so quickly in a field that I knew nothing about going in. The struggle that I worried about going in (programming) became my favorite thing to do. &amp;nbsp;I learned so much about the bonds grad students have and how much easier it is to get to know an advisor versus a Colonel. &amp;nbsp; I will now be seriously considering a graduate school experience after I leave the Air Force. &amp;nbsp; The biggest challenges were simply getting used to the environment. &amp;nbsp;It's a high pace environment at times and an extremely chill pace at others. &amp;nbsp;But in the end, what matters is getting results and I have tremendous respect for that. &amp;nbsp; I was able to find reflectors using methods that had never been published. &amp;nbsp;And to top it off they alligned almost perfectly. &amp;nbsp;This was a tremendous boost in my morale and even though I understand that in seismology sometimes you don't get what you think you get, I am comforted knowing that I at least contributed to this field. &amp;nbsp; I have definitely learned to communicate seismology in a more professional way. &amp;nbsp;When I first got here I remember staring blankly at those I asked for help. &amp;nbsp; I will look into going into the geophysics community though definitely not in Memphis (because of the location). &amp;nbsp;However, CERI is one of the most fascinating places to work. &amp;nbsp; This summer has been a blast and I learned things that I know will translate for the rest of my life. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In two days I get to perform field work with two of the grad students in arkansas and missouri. &amp;nbsp;I can't wait learn more about data collection on this mini-journey. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv6AeVgoP5s Okay so I have to admit, when I found out that I was going to be working on Antarctica-related research, this is what popped into my head. I apologize ahead of time - this WILL get stuck in your head. I played it for Nicole this morning, and I think she may not help me for the rest of the day... That chorus is just so catchy! If (WHEN) I go down to Antarctica someday, this will no doubt be on my travel playlist. And along with Antarctica-themed updates, with Nicole looking at data on Mount Erebus, and another student in our computer lab looking at seismic reflection data in Antarctica, I felt like I had the right to edit the sign on the door for the summer... So my research has finally picked up a bit. Still comes in waves of productivity, especially since both Rick and Harley are out of town this week. But I'm really excited about everything I've been exploring so far. And I definitely think that's the best way to describe this kind of research - exploration. You start pursuing one thing, then likely go over some hurdles as well as find some new aspects to your project that you didn't expect. For example, the focus of my research, at least to begin, is to review areas of two previously published papers: Lough et al 2013, "Seismic detection of an active subglacial magmatic complex in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica" and Peng et al 2014 "Antarctic icequakse triggered by the 2010 Maule earthquake in Chile" (which may still be in the process of publication). I am starting my research looking at Amanda Lough's catalog of events (many of which she devotedly hand picked!), using the subspace detector to enhance the catalog with previously undetected events, and hopefully increase the characterization of these swarms past the 2010-2011 time frame she analyzed. I am excited to look at how the b-value changes with time (relationship between the number of small vs large events - a look at energy release), perhaps how templates change (how the source mechanism may be moving or changing), and go from there. The induced icequakes are also another big focus - especially with triggering being such a hot topic right now with fracking, waste water injection, and the increasing seismicity in the central US. However, like I said, there always seem to be exciting new aspects to your research that you don't see coming. For me, it was that these two papers did not end up being so disconnected. As I looked into the MBL data, trying to decide on filtering parameters, correlation thresholds, and all that nitty gritty - Rick and I stumbled upon something quite exciting. Let me show you some figures and explain... So what do you see? Well you can see my red phase picks on one of the largest events of Amanda's catalog - but it looks pretty lost in that big thing right? What is that you ask? It's a teleseism! It's a large remote earthquake that has been picked up at station ST08 in Anatarctica! And what's the date? March 11, 2011. Sound familiar? It's the M9.0 Tohoku earthquake in Japan! Okay so now let's filter this a bit and try to find our event in there... Now you can see a whole bunch of smaller events! They were lost in the tail of the teleseism! Rick and I had started with Amanda's largest events, and noticed the largest four all arrived in a two hour period on this day - when we took a closer look (or perhaps a broader one), we see that they are all in the tail of this teleseism. Are you thinking what we are thinking? Could this possibly be... TRIGGERING?! So we went to the next biggest event in her catalog on a different day - and it too appeared in a teleseism! So this got us thinking... Of course we can see that not all of these events occur in teleseisms. They are also not like the triggered icequakes, as Amanda's paper wonderfully describes that these are Deep Long Period earthquakes, typical of magmatic processes. So things just got a little more complicated, and a whole heck of a lot more interesting. There is no reason this couldn't be a swarm of magmatic activity, which started independent of remote triggering, but is susceptible to being "kicked" or excited by remote, large scale event triggering, taking advantage of the system when it is in high stress conditions and creating some of the larger events of the swarms, like we see with the March events. So here I took a snapshot of a rough plot of global events against the event count figure from Amanda's study (Lough et al 2013). There are some interesting coinciding peaks that I definitely want to explore - April 2010, June 2010, October 2011, etc. And I can even look into more recent events and see if this triggering/swarm relationship continues or changes. Perhaps as the swarm is less prominant, it is more likely to be affected by triggering, whereas when the swarm is in full swing, like Jan/Feb 2010, it is less obviously affected by outside sources. Very exciting! Now outside of internship stuff - two of my best friends have visited in the last two weeks! Highlights from both: Zack and I climbed the Bastille Crack - a bit of an epic with thunder and rain, but with gorgeous clear skies at the top of the 5 pitch climb. Then we drove late at night down to Independence Pass, sleeping in a parking lot in Leadville for the night. Some great climbing and total shenanigans with friends down there. Sad to see my friend leave, but we already have plans to do some seriously climbing back home - finally getting up the Chief in Squamish (the rain has foiled that plan a couple times now...) Rachel visited the following weekend. So wonderful to be reunited. We are often asked if we are sisters, when we don't quite look alike - but I think being smaller, athletic, continuously giggling girls who can both eat on par with most grown men, there is probably an unconscious attitude exuded by us that make us seem like not just sisters, but twins. We enjoyed a bit too much sun at a lake, some climbing down near Golden, lots of food, a ghost tour of Fort Collins with Nicole, and Rick and &amp;nbsp;his family, some nice movies in bed, and just being together again. The highlight however was going to Boulder to watch the Iron Man finishers this past Sunday. Talk about inspiring! No shame - we both almost cried when the first woman crossed the finish line. Thank goodness for sunglasses. It sparked us to plan to do a half Iron Man next summer (I need to start swimming more...), and just had us taking off talking about our futures. This summer has really shown me how growing up can be a struggle, but it is also so exciting and full of wonderful experiences that you don't even know will happen yet.</summary>

    <summary>When looking over my previous posts, I realized how little I actually talked about my fieldwork. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give it a little more attention. In general the crew would wake up, eat breakfast, and head to the hangar where all of the equipment was stored. Each crew (2-3 people) would pack up their SUV with enough equipment for one and a half stations. After we loaded up and got to the site, the real work began. The first thing that needed to be done was to plan where the equipment would go. We had to find a place for the sensor, the action packer, and the solar panel mount. We had to make sure all the wires would reach, the solar panel would get enough sun, the sensor would have good drainage, and other similar details. Once the plan was decided, it was time to dig and lug. 1-2 people would dig the hole for the seismometer while the other person would begin hauling stuff from the car. Once the hole was ready, a quick drying cement pier was poured for the seismometer to rest on. While waiting for the concrete to dry, we would set up the solar panel and the action packer. The action packer contains all of the electrical equipment that powers and communicates with the sensor. Finally, the sensor gets placed and buried, the action packer gets covered with heavy logs, and pictures are taken. Sprinkled between these steps are unwanted nuisances such as bruises, bug bites, flat tires, missing equipment, lost keys, etc. We installed the majority of the seismometers those first three weeks, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t install the last seven until mid-July because of permitting issues. I was on one of the teams that finished up the installs during the service run. A service run consists of driving to the site, switching memory disks, and checking to make sure everything is working. For the service run I was working out of Trout Lake with an employee from CVO, Cascades Volcano Observatory. There is no cell service so email was the only way to communicate with other service teams. We would check in with the other groups at night to make sure everyone made it back alright. One night I decided to check in with the following short story. "7/15: The story of two young travelers passing through Trout Lake It was mid July and the heat was unforgiving. It was even harder to bear when that overloaded SUV decided to fight back. The odds were against them when she blew a tire on that old dusty road. This wasn't the first hardship they encountered, but it came at the worst time. They couldn't chance being stranded since their comrades were hours away. The only option was to see if that old four wheeler could be put back together. The help they needed was back in town at an old service station, so the two travelers turned tail and ran. Once that old hunk of junk was fixed up, they decided to give it one more go. Although their hopes were high, their original plan was abandoned. They decided to head to the longest and most arduous site, to deploy one of the few remaining seismometers. The two weren't out of the woods yet. They went on a few unexpected detours and were devoured by godless horse flies. After their long day was done, they headed back to that little town shadowed by the mountain. &amp;nbsp;They grabbed a fulfilling meal and drank a nice strong brew... They were victorious." Did I realize how ridiculous it was as I was writing? Yes, but I enjoyed every minute of it.</summary>

    <summary>With only four days of the internship remaining, today was the day I submitted the abstract for my research. Looking back, this was a long term goal of mine to get it done by at least August 6th. In addition, another goal was to start a rough draft on my poster. So far I have gotten the template design ready, as well as most of the headers for the poster. Half of the poster involving earth tide triggering is nearly complete (except captions), while I have just started the other half of the poster on remote triggering. This week I will be working more on creating plots and last-minute analysis of the data. This is to ensure I really understand the material and am able to present it at AGU.&amp;nbsp;Speaking of AGU, I have also set out some more goals regarding this event. They are 1) continue working on the poster throughout the fall (late August mostly) and 2) Arrive prepared for the fall meeting December 15th.&amp;nbsp; I have learned a lot this summer as it has been an awesome experience. Although I spent a great deal of time on the computer coding, I have learned lots of stuff in many areas. I explored the Oregon coast, as well as its Cascade Mountains and the high desert to the East. I am very excited to return to my hometown of Reno to see friends and family, but Eugene, Oregon will certainly have its fair share of memories. I have also made new friends, both in and out of the geophysics field who are mostly graduate-level. Talking to some of the graduate students has made me interested in graduate school. Whether or not I spend my graduate life at UofO has yet to be decided, but their insight and the entire experience here has brought me closer to a decision on whether graduate school is right for me. Of course, there is not only one path to graduate school. I could always take a break and try to to find work in the field, and pick up graduate school later. Regardless, I am most definitely interested in the geophysics field after this internship experience.</summary>

    <summary>Hard to believe this is my last week! The past few weeks has involved a lot code writing and processing data. We came back from Alaska with data from the suveys we took as well as from the stations that have been monitoring background noise. As I may have mentioned before there are 7 stations that have been installed since October of last year as part of the&amp;nbsp;Permafrost Active Layer Seismic Interferometry Experiment (PALSIE). The stations are arranged in two circles of 25 and 50 meter radii composed of 3 stations each, plus a center station (see my early posts for a figure). Because of internet limitations at Poker Flats we can't download the data from Albuquerque, so one of the last things we did was to download up to the day before. We are also using data from a nearby PASCAL sight which is about 2 miles from our site on the top of a hill. We also did a ReMi (Refraction Microtremor) survey close to their station. The past few weeks has been spend processing the data from both PALSIE and PASCAL into the H/V spectral ratio. When we plot the mean and standard deviation we see fairly constant peaks in the lower frequencies and building fluctuations in higher frequencies. Today I'll be running the spectrum of the data to be sure that the changes we see are due to changing geology (as the ground freezes and thaws) and not a changing wave field. Hopefully we should also be getting data from the weeks since Alaska in the next day or two, although we will probably just do a quick check to see what has been happening.&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>The body waves are revealing themselves! Among the sets of correlations I have been carefully creating and inspecting, a small but coherent wave has shown up before the surface wave in my plots. I am overjoyed by their appearance, because it happened just in time for me to write about it in my AGU abstract, which is due next Wednesday. I was a bit worried about being too speculative, but now that the waves are actually visible, I am more confident in what I can express in the abstract. Despite my confidence, I am still new to abstract-writing in general and thus not stellar at it, but the more experienced members of my group have been terrific about helping me with editing. &amp;nbsp; Now that I have found a wave, I need to figure out exactly what it is. It appears to be an S wave, but there are several phases of S wave it could be, like Sn or SmS, that have moved through different parts of the earth before arriving back at the surface. Luckily, I have SEIZMO&amp;rsquo;s TauP function, which returns information such arrival time and speed of the wave when given a source/receiver distance. I will use TauP to compare the known behavior of various phases with what I observe in my plots, and hopefully be able to pick out the phases I have been seeing. &amp;nbsp; In an attempt to improve the clarity of the waves in my plots, I am correlating and stacking more of my data to add to it. I am also trying another stacking method: instead of removing the time windows after earthquakes, I will try keeping only those windows. Earthquake coda, the time after an earthquake occurs, can show different phases with different levels of visibility than plain ambient noise, so it is worth looking into. &amp;nbsp; Another factor I am interested in investigating is the effect of the region of origin on the appearance of the waves. Previous recovery of body wave phases has mostly been from areas with relatively simple geologic structure like cratons, but the United States has a wide variety of geology across it. I plan on sorting apart my data by the stations&amp;rsquo; locations so that I can see if waves are easier or harder to find in different parts of the country, like the great plains or the rocky mountains. I got to have a fun break from research on Thursday evening by attending a Drum Corps International show in Quincy, a southern suburb of Boston. DCI is like major league marching band; the groups have rigorous auditions, rehearse practically nonstop, and go on a performance and competition tour through the summer. To a marching band geek like me, DCI bands are practically rock stars, and they are a blast to see in real life. My favorite shows of the night were by the Madison Scouts and the Boston Crusaders.</summary>

    <summary>I finally finished collecting, autocorrelating, and then proofreading all of the data last week. &amp;nbsp; I then printed out all of the stacks and gui screenshots (~150 pages) and marked my picks for what was estimated as the reflectors.&amp;nbsp; This week, Dr. Langston was able to get me MATLAB code that accomplishes an automatic gain control as well as a conversion from time to depth using a velocity model for the region. &amp;nbsp; I did this for a few stations and will be presenting him with the results tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;We will be looking for similarities in the reflectors in the BHN and BHE stations, then compare the reflectors of one station with nearby stations. &amp;nbsp; Next week I will be going to Arkansas to gather data from 14 NELE stations. &amp;nbsp;I am really excited and have been self designated the dog/horse whisperer, which means I will be keeping these animals at bay while the others gather the data. &amp;nbsp; This will be a great experience as I will be able to see the process involved in gathering the data with respects to the landowner, maintenance of the sensor, and the gathering of data. &amp;nbsp;It really puts the huge amount of data you have at your disposal into perspective! Also I got a free NELE hat and T-shirt so I'm content. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while blog, but I have been pretty busy this past week to really sit down and explain the cruise. I&amp;rsquo;ll try not to embellish the story too much, but it really was an amazing adventure for me with plenty of good and bad moments. &amp;nbsp; As we began our roughly six-hour drive down from Seattle to Newport I was noticing my throat was feeling sore. I tried to remain optimistic, but I could still tell I was getting sick. I chugged some Emergen-C and crossed my fingers, only to feel quite ill the morning before we set out to sea. I felt terrible, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be that guy that didn&amp;rsquo;t help, so I managed to help load the ship while making some new friends among the scientists and crew. The crew was quite colorful, but more on them later. &amp;nbsp; We stayed the night on the ship, and the next morning as we set out on our voyage I encountered my first hurdle of the trip. Now I grew up in the fabulous desert of Las Vegas, and had only been on a recreational sailboat once in my life. Even then, I remember very specifically the terrible seasickness I experienced. However, I was older now and optimistic. My sister is in the Navy I thought, this should be easy. Within the first hour of eating breakfast I puked everything I ate and probably more. I would like to mention however, that the R/V Oceanus was designed in the 70s, and later refitted in the 90s with a deck house and pilot house- this increase in vertical weight adds to its roll as the ship travels. From what I was told, the ship on an average day does 30-degree rolls because of this added vertical weight, which is quite a lot, and can have some nasty effects for an inexperienced person like me. Sadly, I was pretty incapacitated for the first 50 hours. Being nauseous from seasickness and losing all of my fluids while I was sick took its toll. I stayed in my bed for the first two days, and only scurried to get breakfast once for some fluids. While I was eating breakfast a crewmember tried to make some small talk with me. I ended up telling him my sister was in the Navy when I noticed he had a Navy shirt on. He could definitely tell I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing well, and kind of laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t run in the family I guess huh.. hahaha.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; Maybe my sister heard him, but by the next morning I was feeling totally better. I ate a ton of food, which, by the way, was absolutely amazing every day. My shift was 3pm to 3am, and I was finally able to join the other scientists. It was actually really fun. We helped monitor and setup the OBS (Ocean Bottom Seismometers) as another team deployed them. We also took some TCD (Temperature Conductivity Depth) tests between stations. I learned a lot, and was able to get some of my own work done for my project. We saw some dolphins, whales, and even caught some wild tuna that we ate the next day! Everything seemed to be going well, and we looked like we were going to come back to Newport early.. until the generator malfunctioned. &amp;nbsp; I remember sitting in the galley talking to my co-scientists when suddenly the abandon ship alarm went off and all the power went out. I quickly went to get my life jacket and lined up in my appropriate spot like we practiced in the safety drill. Of course this time everyone is scared enough to contribute to a worried atmosphere. We waited for a little while, and then the captain came down and told us there was nothing to be worried about, and that the problem should be fixed soon- definitely a sigh of relief was felt throughout the room. We got power back, and everything went back to normal- sort of. Within a few hours of the incident we had changed course. Instead of going to the next deployment site we were now heading toward the port in Eureka California for an emergency docking. Of course, this path brought us directly through a stormy area. No one really told me why and you don&amp;rsquo;t really ask questions when you&amp;rsquo;re in that situation, but you definitely don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable knowing whatever the issue is requires an &amp;lsquo;emergency docking&amp;rsquo;. My shift had me used to staying up to 3am, and I decided to stay up. I was hanging out in the galley when the chief engineer came in to grab some coffee. We had talked a little bit before about music and jazz, and he was a really nice guy. He looked a little tired and I asked him how everything was. With some added four letter words he made it clear things were not going well. He told me that they were not sure what the problem was, and had been up trying to figure it out for the longest time- something you always want to hear on your first cruise. While we&amp;rsquo;re talking, in walks one of my favorite members of the crew, Dave. If you have ever seen Jaws the boatman Quint played by Robert Shaw could probably be a close representation of Dave, yet probably Dave was harder to understand. Dave had this amazing phrase that he would use nearly everywhere he went... &amp;ldquo;Ohhhh yaaaa,&amp;rdquo; just like the Kool-Aid Man but add on 20+ years of habitual cigarette smoking. Anyway, he mentions to the engineer that it would be really bad if the power went out again. The stormy seas we were going through, if we had lost power again would leave us without being able to steer the ship into the waves and possibly a capsize. GREAT. I&amp;rsquo;m now kicking myself for being awake and hearing this. However, Dave probably noticed my face go white while hearing this and in an effort to console me talks about how even if that happened it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the worst he has seen and goes on to tell me stories of all the crazy things he has seen. For better or worse his stories chipped at the time and gave me some reassurance that it could be a lot worse. One of my fondest memories during those stories was when one of the veteran scientists came out of bed to grab some rope and straps.. I asked him, &amp;ldquo;What are those for?&amp;rdquo; and he just gave me a casual.. &amp;ldquo;Oh, to strap myself into the bed.&amp;rdquo; Just to paint a picture of how much we were rolling during that stormy night to Eureka. &amp;nbsp; We spent the following day in Eureka while the engineers worked to fix the problem. I had a much-needed call with my girlfriend and the scientists all went out to a nice Indian restaurant. We came back that night, and were so glad to hear that the problem had been solved- a loose circuit breaker. The next few days went by really smoothly, and we made it back in one piece. The cruise was definitely an adventure and it was an experience I will not soon forget. I really must tip my hat to the wonderful cook, scientist, and crew that worked so diligently to make it a successful trip. Will I do something like this again...probably not, but given the opportunity anything is possible.</summary>

    <summary>This is belated. I wrote this on Friday, when I meant to post it, and I'll just pretend that it's still last week... You know how I said I was hoping to have great things to share? Well... Not so much. But as my title alludes, there was at least one high point. Let me explain... On Monday Nicole and I went to the NEIC for our normal day. Harley took us to another meeting, this time with the Colorado Geological Survey, where members of CGS met with seismologists of the NEIC, of CSU (my advisor), CU, and School of Mines to talk with the COGCC (Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission) to talk about the current state of induced seismicity specific to Colorado. This meeting was pretty fascinating, mostly because it was the first time where I got to see the Oil and Gas side involved in the discussion, and let me tell you, they definitely are actively involved. The topics of the meeting were mostly about policy and what sorts of ideas can be implemented and pursued for the future: expanding the Colorado seismograph network by a great deal, instating a state seismologist to monitor, manage date, archive, and be readily available to respond rather than having multiple people with other responsibilities, and creating a more consistent advising network for the COGCC. I was impressed by how much they do want to understand what needs to happen, and having advice from those who really are proficient in the state seismology offers a great amount of substance behind the decisions that the COGCC makes and advocates. Nicole and I briefly explained our research, and for one the first times I felt quite confident explaining at least what I&amp;nbsp;hope&amp;nbsp;to do. I sincerely appreciate that Harley takes us to all of these meetings. It is nice to see what a job in earthquake hazard entails and meetings like these are a big part of it. After the meeting, I had an hour of breakthrough (this is the elation part!) -&amp;nbsp;I could look at my data! Harley wanted me to find an event that had been cataloged in my data stream to make sure that everything was looking correct. To stress just how patchy the intraplate Antarctic&amp;nbsp;network is, there are only two&amp;nbsp;events in the USGS archive for 2011 and just one for 2010, which is the time period I'm starting with on the POLENET network. Both of&amp;nbsp;the 2011 events were close to only one station each, but the 2010 M4.2 was perfectly in the middle of four! I was able to find all three, picked P &amp;amp; S&amp;nbsp;arrivals for the 2010 event&amp;nbsp;and Harley showed me how to do a rough location with sac2eloc, comparing its location to the one posted in the archive. Then when we tried to carry it further in our processing, we arrived at some problems with how the data is loaded. Oh well. I had a sudden feeling of monumental success for that hour! I had another PhD student at CSU tell me this about research science: 95% percent of it is frustration and 5% is exultation. Perhaps a bit harsh, but definitely experienced some brief exultation! Another big part of this week: AGU ABSTRACTS! Nicole and I had to finish ours by today so that we could submit them to USGS for internal review before going to AGU. Writing an abstract when you have no results does feel a bit weird, and the editing process was a bit of an intense shock - but it makes sense that Rick, my advisor, would be able to truly explain our methodology more completely than I. It was definitely a learning process, but with a great deal of his input we finished it pretty quickly. It feels pretty crazy to have it "out there" and done, but also really exciting. I'll likely be on three total abstracts - mine, Nicole's (been helping her with some&amp;nbsp;data processing - which is definitely prepping me to be really efficient and competent when my own data is process-able), and likely another with Nicole doing an education experiment with kids (details to come!). I'm in Golden again today... We started off meeting with Harley and Dan. When your advisor begins by saying "How attached are you to this data?" - you know something is up. We are all starting to realize that Antarctica does not provide the best data. This isn't surprising considering the conditions. But the NEIC is not used to such messy signals or intense gaps. As an international earthquake force, they are are usually able to get some good looking data. However, we did not quit, instead returned to "hand to hand combat" with the network and before lunch Harley and I managed to find a small earthquake, make a template, and run it through our program without any problems. Almost eerie how well it worked, that all throughout lunch I'm just hoping it's running smoothly by the time I get back. Dan took Nicole and I out for lunch, let us vent about research frustrations and gave us some much needed and appreciated guidance and advice. I'm realizing that most people have the same experiences with research, and are usually more than willing to help if asked. Maybe I've just met some really wonderful people at the NEIC, but I like to think it's a universal quality. After lunch and a little waiting, suddenly my internship was back into a full swing of elation once more! WE HAVE CORRELATIONS (shown in the figure below)! Of course their correlation coefficient isn't wonderful with the template we chose, but they do show remarkable consistency between events. This is good news for my future work with the data! We were all giddy with excitement about seeing tangible results - we could even see the events decreasing in detection/correlation as we moved towards the end of this known swarm. In another part of the building, someone was working with my data on Hydra, attempting to find locations with events in the stream, and of course we get a phone call about the results while we are all excitedly looking at our correlations. The room goes silent... We watch Harley for a reaction as he says "Okay so you've found locations... Are they events or are they crap?" And he looks at me, grins and shouts "Emma, they're not crap!" Antarctica - you truly brought the goods today! I have an actual to do list for next week and am excited to begin. Of course, only after my weekend plans... Last night my best friend Zack came to town for a visit, we did a taster tray at Odell Brewery, got chicken and waffles at 415 (an amazing restaurant), and planned our weekend of climbing. This afternoon after work we will go straight to Eldorado Canyon and climb the Bastille Crack (super classic easy trad) then head down to Independence Pass for the rest of the weekend with some friends of mine from Fort Collins. I'm incredibly happy to be reunited with my favorite climbing partner - this weekend will be a celebration of all we've been through and our future adventures as friends. I will definitely post some pictures!</summary>

    <title>Challenge Shmallenge - Gina Belair</title>

    <summary>Whether you love or hate research, most people agree that it is challenging. It is part of what brings researchers together. Knowing that other people are struggling and working as hard as you, helps build a strong community. This summer has been full of challenges. My first day seemed like an insurmountable challenge. So did the prospect of digging holes and carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment 15 days straight. Realizing weekends didn&amp;rsquo;t exist in fieldwork was a bit of a shock, but I was so busy that I barely noticed. I was not one of the strongest people during fieldwork, but I worked just as hard. I think my biggest success was the respect I earned from the PIs. They trusted my work, respected my opinion, and came to me for my TETRIS skills when loading the SUVs. Fieldwork was an amazing experience because I got to know brilliant, well respected PIs in a setting that allowed us to be ourselves. That is one of the reasons why I love geophysics, people will accept you for who you are as long as you do the same for them. There were challenges during fieldwork, but I never felt like I failed because everyone was in it together. Outside of fieldwork, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that time management has been the hardest part. There is this immense subject that thousands of people have been working on for years, and I have a summer to learn about it. In my case, I have even less time to work on the research because I spent four weeks in the field. There is no part of me that regrets those four weeks, but it makes my short time in Seattle seem like I&amp;rsquo;m climbing up a mountain that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a summit. I began my internship two weeks after the other IRIS interns and then I spent my first three weeks in the field. After one short week in Seattle, I was back in the field for another week collecting the data I will be analyzing. It felt like no time at all, but five weeks, half of my internship, flew by right before my eyes. It has been a struggle to keep my head down and work without having deadlines loom in my mind. I have always found that stress prevents you from thinking clearly, but it is in my nature to stress about deadlines that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel prepared for. Although I spoke with my PI everyday during fieldwork, there was not a lot of time to discuss the research I was going to do. It was unreasonable to expect there to be productive research talks after 10-12 hour days in the field. Although the reasons I feel unprepared are justified, I can&amp;rsquo;t write them down on my AGU abstract. Whether I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m ready to or not, I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to write about my research this summer. It is absolutely terrifying. Another challenge that I am hoping to overcome this week, is wrapping my head around one of the aspects of my research. I will determine the orientation of the seismometers in Matlab, using a structure that was created by my PI Ken Creager. In programming, a structure is an array that organizes data into fields. The structure I am working with, a coral structure, contains information about the seismogram from a specific seismic station. I am still learning about the fields a coral structure contains, and about all of the possible ways to manipulate it. As I have come to expect with programming, the majority of my time has been spent testing and retesting little pieces of code. I am hoping to bring all of the pieces together in the coming week. Whether you come out of a challenge feeling like a failure or a success depends on how you perceive challenges. This summer, I have chosen to see them as opportunities. So when I start to get overwhelmed, I just think "Challenge shmallenge."</summary>

    <summary>My professor and postdocs have been gone for most of this week at a conference, but I have kept plenty busy on my own. I have been creating the same set of figures (plotted correlations, amplitude comparisons, beamforming, et cetera) for a variety of single-year correlations (some with high-amplitude traces taken out, some with time windows of earthquakes taken out, some correlated with different time spans, et cetera) in order to figure out which methods of correlation and stacking can do the best job of picking out waves. Once I declare a &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo; out of the many combinations of methods, which will hopefully happen early next week, I will apply it to the full eight years of seismic data. &amp;nbsp; I have continued to take advantage of the MIT environment by going to more lectures; they are usually only an hour apiece, so I can easily attend them without having to spend an extreme amount of time catching up on work later. On Monday, I attended a talk about cloud microphysics (the way that tiny bits of water, ice, and other materials behave in clouds) and found it very interesting. Tuesday afternoon, I went to a lecture about the use of proteins in polymer chemistry, and only barely understood what was going on, but still found what I did understand to be pretty neat. On Thursday, I listed to a materials science talk about growing perfect silicon crystals; it was also rather cool. &amp;nbsp; Last weekend, I decided to kick back for an afternoon at the beach! Revere Beach, near the end of one of Boston&amp;rsquo;s subway lines, was hosting a sand sculpting festival, so I saw some truly astounding artwork in addition to the normal beach sights of waves, shells, seagulls, dead stingrays, strange tourists, and slightly questionable food vendors.</summary>

    <summary>It seems that almost everyone has heard of Mt. St. Helens. When I mention my project to people I get a mixture of responses. From my mother: &amp;ldquo;Is that the one that had that big explosion? You better be careful Gina.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; From locals around the volcano: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re watching that one? You should&amp;nbsp;be checking out Rainier, that&amp;rsquo;s the one getting ready to blow.&amp;rdquo; When I talk to geophysicists: &amp;ldquo;So you&amp;rsquo;re working on iMUSH, then? What part of the project?&amp;rdquo; iMUSH stands for Imaging Magma Under St. Helens and it has three components. There is an active source component that involves drilling boreholes and setting off explosions within the crust. Another component is a magnetotelluric survey. The last part of the project is the one that I am involved in. It is the passive part of the experiment in which 70 broadband seismometers will be deployed on and around Mt. St. Helens and will stay in place for two years. This part of the experiment will allow imaging at a much greater depth than the short period sensors. A very large component of my summer will be spent doing fieldwork. My first two and a half weeks were spent installing the seismometers. I will also go on service runs to make sure that everything is running smoothly at the sites and to retrieve the flash disks storing the data. We completed the first service run this week in order to prepare for the active source experiment. I will also be utilizing the data we just obtained in order to check the orientation of the sensors. The sensors should be oriented towards true north, but there is error involved in placing them. It is important to check this orientation and then correct for it when analyzing the data.</summary>

    <summary>Last entry was a bit of a downer, so let's try to improve with this week's. I still have not processed data. I know, shocking right?! However, this week I feel much more acceptance about that fact. We have uploaded it, and I can see it, taunting me, available to use, however, there are of course a few more things we have to do at the NEIC before I can dive in. Oh, and a new twist for you all - my abstract is no longer due on the the 30th, it's due next Friday. Yes, that's right, 1 week from today. And today is almost over. BUT, I have a plan! I have done a lot of thinking about what I need and want to do with my data this past week from working with Nicole on the same processes in OK, from meetings we have had with our NEIC advisor Harley, Dan McNamara of the NEIC/USGS, and now talking with Rick. We were also assigned to make a powerpoint this week explaining our research to a hypothetical audiance of 15-18 year olds with only basic intro knowledge of earthquakes. Not having much research to talk about, it really made me reflect on the background of my project, what has been done and what I will do. Since I have no real research leaps and bounds to discuss, I'll just tell you about highlights from my week... Tuesday Nicole and I planned to go down to Golden for a day at the NEIC, so I left Monday night to meet my good friend Laura for an evening climb at Earth Treks, her local gym down there. It was incredible. This gym is really new, with an obviously insane budget for holds, and the sport climbing walls are both steep and long - perfect for an evening of girls crushing on some plastic. Tuesday at the NEIC was pretty mellow. Harley and I made plans for what data was priority to download next, and things began to make headway there. We went to lunch at the Sherpa House again - third time is not the charm. I think we need to try something new... However, Wes Thelen of the Hawaii Volcano Observatory joined us. A former student of University of Washington, it was really nice to talk to someone who spent some time in the northwest, knew my advisor Jackie, and knew the research that had made me interested in pursuing seismology in the first place (Kate Allstadt's research with icequakes on Rainier and Jackie's work with signals from rock-ice avalanches on Iliamna). Wes and I joked about how much these women enjoy and excel at studying these less than classical earthquake signals that I have a growing interest in - it's like the "one man's trash is another man's treasure" except with seismology... and that trash sounds like a harsh way to describe these events... because they truly are intriguing. I'm excited to delve more into icequakes with my own research this summer. The highlight of Tuesday though was Nicole and my meeting with Dan McNamara. He told us about all he'd been doing with OK earthquakes, doing multiple event relocation, as well as looking at b-values and swarm characterization with this program in Matlab called MapSeis. What he was doing revived my excitement for this research. I suddenly started thinking of all the things I could do with my data - how I could do a lot of the same things he did to understand swarms myself. Wednesday was a pretty lackluster day at CSU for Nicole and I. Got some work done, but nothing exciting. I met a new friend for lunch, after which we were going to go climb in Poudre Canyon. However, it was drizzling and the idea of climbing on wet rock is not the most appealing. Yet, like it was meant to be, I locked my keys in my car, so we had to wait for AAA to come rescue me, and by the time that was done it was starting to get sunny! Off to the Canyon we went! We managed to get in 3 pitches of sport, then it poured. I mean really started raining. And I still had to clean the draws off our last climb. A really cool moderate 5.10 that I wanted to climb, but with water starting to pool in crimps, I opted to top rope it so we could get out of there faster and with no needless falls. So we finished our climb in the gym. But the craziness of that afternoon, and just getting out on the rock for those two pitches each made Wednesday one of my favorite days in Fort Collins so far. Thursday, yesterday, we were back at the NEIC. In dresses. Yes. Nicole and I dressed up (literally. ha. ha.) for a meeting with the Colorado Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Council, where Dr. Anne Sheehan of CU Boulder gave a talk about the earthquakes in Greeley earlier this year. It was really interesting to see the methods that we are pursuing put to use with recent events, especially with events as controversial as induced seismicity. They are making some incredible policy decisions in that area, and it's exciting to see the development of these regulations occur in realtime with the methods Nicole and I are using! We also went to a talk on earthquake induced landslides, part of a summer seminar series at the USGS. After taking a landslides class this winter, and learning more about seismology, and the difficulties of research, I felt like I could understand a lot of what was being discussed, and the fellow USGS/NEIC interns and I talked about what we thought of the predictive programs being used. All in all, a long post for a long, yet much improved, week. Don't have much substantial to show for it, but do have a new peace of mind. Let's hope next week goes off without a hitch and I will have lots to share.</summary>

    <summary>I had a real adventure over last weekend: two days in Maine! The coastal cities there are only a few hours away by train, so I visited a friend there who used to live in Nebraska; I had not seen her in over a year. We happily reunited and she made sure I got the full Maine experience; we saw lighthouses, relaxed on the beach, poked around tide pools on rocky coasts, and ate local lobster and whoopie pies. It was really great to get out of the big city for a while, see an old friend, and experience a new place. &amp;nbsp; Back at the office this week, the search for body waves has continued. I have been doing a lot of beamforming, the process which takes a set of correlations and returns a plot showing the times and speeds for which there is wave propagation, over various windows of times and station separations, searching for bright blobs that indicate a wave. In this search, I get hints on where to look from SEIZMO&amp;rsquo;s TauP function, which gives the arrival time and speed of various seismic wave phases at any entered distance. &amp;nbsp; I took a break from my own research today to listen to a seminar from a professor doing research in nonlinear optics at Cornell. His group has been using silicon-based microresonators (rings of silicon compounds at which you point lasers) to make frequency combs (like a bunch of lasers all at once, each with a different frequency, and all of the frequencies are equal intervals apart). It was nice to take a break from being moderately confused by geophysics to be moderately confused by regular physics for a while. &amp;nbsp; I have also been working hard on my communicating with non-scientists project, a slide show and notes that would guide me in explaining my research in a presentation to the general public. In addition to improving my scientific communication skills as a whole, it is helping me come up with the elevator speech version of my research that I know I will have to repeatedly give to my classmates, professors, friends, family, and more upon my return to Nebraska. On the whole, it is an interesting and useful project! &amp;nbsp; Time until AGU abstract deadline: two and a half weeks Total time left at MIT: one month</summary>

    <summary>The waves are beginning to reveal themselves! Using the first year of our seismic readings, I have correlated the data, stacked the correlations, and then plotted the stacks into figures where the waves can actually be visible. In addition to simply looking at the plots of the stacks, I have also been searching for the body waves by using a handy process called beamforming, which involves taking the correlation stacks and the separation distances of their stations, and then searching for wave propagation at a range of velocities by using the inverse Radon transform. Different types of waves move at different speeds, so the phases present can be revealed by looking at the velocities that show motion. I show both a plot of stacks and an inverse Radon transform plot below. So far, I have primarily been seeing the dominant surface waves instead of the more subtle body waves for which I am looking, but seeing any waves at all means I am generally on the right track. My first plan in making the body waves appear is changing the way I stack the correlations. Currently, we drop the &amp;ldquo;loud&amp;rdquo; time windows that might contain an earthquake by using a cutoff root-mean-square of each window&amp;rsquo;s trace, but this method can also remove windows of good data that are loud, such as during a big storm. Instead, I have just created and started testing a function that removes windows with earthquakes by comparing the times of the windows to a global catalog of earthquakes. It may appear that I should have been using this method since the start, but the other way is much easier to program and much quicker to use, so I hoped it would be enough. Regardless, the trouble I am facing with the new method is deciding how much time I should remove with each earthquake: too little would be taking in bad data, but too much would be ignoring good data. Assignment #6: figures I have uploaded two figures here: imgur.com/a/VGnzO . You can click on each one to zoom in on them. They have no figure titles and the axes titles are rather limited, but these are not meant to be poster-worthy; they are just an example of the step through which I am currently working on my way to some real answers. I made both figures in MATLAB, the first with SeismicLab&amp;rsquo;s wigb function and the second with MATLAB&amp;rsquo;s imagesc function. Descriptions of the figure contents are as follows: Figure One - Each line in this plot represents the correlations from one pair of seismic stations. A wiggle in one line shows a wave arrival at one station when the other is considered to be a virtual source (that is basically how a correlation works). The correlation lines here are actually stacks of correlation traces from an entire year of data, giving them a much greater signal-to-noise ratio than individual traces. When arranged with respect to the separation distance between the stations (most of which happened to end up negative here because of how we set it up for East-West locations), a wave propagating at about 2.8 kilometers per second becomes quite clear; this wave is the surface wave. The waves for which I am actually looking are body waves, which would have greater speed and lower amplitude, but none are visible in this figure. Hopefully, I will have a figure showing body waves soon. Figure Two - This colormap displays the inverse Radon transform of the correlation stacks mentioned above, and despite its radically different appearance from figure one, this figure shows much of the same information we gathered before. The inverse Radon transform (which I was able to do with the SEIZMO suite of seismic analysis tools for MATLAB from Washington University in St. Louis) starts with a chosen distance (I picked 300 kilometers separation) and looks for waves arriving over a range of times and propagating over a range of velocities. The bright blob on the graph says that a wave moving at angular slowness 38 seconds/degree (about 2.8 kilometers/second) crossed the 300 kilometer mark at around 110 seconds; this speed and time indicate that the blob is the same surface wave we saw in figure one. The blob is made of alternating high and low stripes and has more subtle stripes emanating from it because of interference from all of the individual correlation stacks. If this data had a strong body wave in it, there would be another blob with lower amplitude located above and to the left of the surface wave.</summary>

    <summary>For this week I will be posting an image of a GUI I have recently been using to look at stacks of autocorrelations of my data. This Gui is very useful for identifying outliers and seeing if the 9 month stack of data correlates with the majority of my autocorrelations. &amp;nbsp; Each waveform is 10 hours of data with each windown containing 25 waveforms. &amp;nbsp; Unfortunately I cannot post an image to this blog at this time but I will try to post it in the comments section or in another blog post.</summary>

    <summary>http://www.iris.edu/hq/internship/images/uploads/Intern_Images/2014/Cooper/Schuster.png &amp;nbsp; To best represent my data, I chose a Schuster plot for the Geysers geothermal area because it was my first time in MATLAB writing my own code. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to write code now and have done so for remote triggering, wellhead injection volume, etc. I used a program called Schuster and edited the time period intervals to fit my own analysis. I wrote a code that converted the earthquake matlabdate periods in hour periods on the x-axis., and looped the same code into all of the other sites I am studying. I used the title function, axis label, and the legend (which was complicated for a while). I need to read up on how to put in a caption, but I will explain the image below. What this image shows is a range of time periods (in hours), and how well these periods correlate to the earthquake times in a catalog. For example, if earthquakes only occur in the morning on a 24 hour basis, you would see a huge spike at 24 hours, because in that situation earthquakes are correlated to the 24 hour period. What I am testing to see if earthquakes are more likely to occur when the earth tides are at their peak, which makes sense intuitively because peak times are when earth tides exert the greatest force on faults. The Geysers catalog I&amp;rsquo;m using is from 2012-2014 and includes over 40,000 earthquakes in a small area around the Geysers geothermal field. The colored lines show different tidal periods at different times, and if there is any correlation between induced seismicity and earth tides, the periods at the colored lines should see a spike. The most important line is the black line M2 and represents the strongest tide at about 12.4 hours. The M2 does pass the 99% confidence interval, so according this this graph earth tides can trigger earthquakes. For some reason the colored lines change back to gray after they pass the 99% confidence interval, so I need to still figure out why that happens.</summary>

    <title>ALASKA! Days 1 and 2 - Rebekah_Lee</title>

    <summary>Alaska: Days 1 and 2 Well today marks the end of a second busy day in Alaska. As I write this it is 10:30pm local time and the sun is still shining as if it were about 7pm. The sun will set at about 12:30 tonight but not enough to get completely dark before it rises again at 3:30am. We are staying at a hotel in Fairbanks as the site is just 30 miles outside of town at Poker Flat Research Range.&amp;nbsp; Monday started out with a fairly steady rain in the morning. We geared up with our rain jackets in the midst of this and attempted to take some data. There was no problem in obtaining the data, we were just poking the ground with a stick until it hit permafrost, but there was a problem in recording it. Unfortunately, we did not bring a walkie talkie or a notebook you could use in the rain. We tried wrapping it in a plastic bag but very quickly found that this would not work. Fortunately the kind folks at the research range let us borrow one of theirs even though they were a little short as well. They also got to hear everything we said since it was hooked in their system.&amp;nbsp; The rain actually started letting up after this and stopped altogether at some point. We did this across a couple of different lines on the field and tested the equipment from IRIS in preparation for the next day. The idea for the second day was to lay down a line of 48 geophones, take data for ReMi&amp;nbsp; (we just needed a source at the end of the line versus between every geophone).&amp;nbsp; And then move the line and repeat. Set up however took much longer than anticipated. The ground we are working on is thawed ground above permafrost and is very wet (especially with the 6 inches of rain they&amp;rsquo;ve had since the middle of June) and spongy. Laying out the cables was difficult since we couldn&amp;rsquo;t take the entire roll and walk along dropping it as needed. Since the ground was also covered in a think moss we had drive the geophones some distance in the ground in order to get (we hoped) better coupling. In the end we finally got everything set up but it had taken I think 3 hours to set up. After lunch we got the hammer out to take some data only to find that it was not triggering! This wasn&amp;rsquo;t terrible since we could trigger it manually but a little inconvenient. The data started coming in finally but was not at all what was expected. We have some theories as to what caused what we saw and are going to test it out tomorrow. Right now we are quite a bit behind schedule and have had to make some adjustments to the plan. Hopefully, the new sledge hammer with a metal tip will trigger better for one thing. Fortunately we had an extra day built into the schedule for contingencies. Looks like we won&amp;rsquo;t be having a &amp;ldquo;tourist&amp;rdquo; day but hopefully we will have learned a lot by the end. From what I understand, there has been very little seismic work done over permafrost.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow is a big day for us , especially as it is Rob&amp;rsquo;s last day, hopefully this time tomorrow we will be celebrating a successful day of solving the problems we encountered today! &amp;nbsp; PS. see a few photos and read about the last few days at my other blog http://www.myintroductiontoseismology.blogspot.com</summary>

    <title>[6] It Figures… - Ivan Kurz</title>

    <summary>...That, upon reading that our next post should feature a figure, my first third thought was, "I can use MATLAB to plot this figure!" The result is here. This graph was supposed to represent work vs. time/results, but what sort of work? Cumulative? If so, the graph would be a fairly standard straight line. I would never expect the work done to decrease. Rather, in order to convey the effort I effect instantaneously, it makes sense to instead plot power over time. What do the curves mean? The bulk of the effort, as you can see, transpires toward the middle of the project, in cycles roughly representing how often I receive a batch of proposed assignments from my adviser, and how I progress on them. I started from nothing on 1 June, and presumedly will work up until the end on 15 August. The height of the curve represents the proportion of the maximum power I can deliver.</summary>

    <summary>Wow, sorry, just realized none of that post saved for some reason...let's try this again. &amp;nbsp;I guess now this is my fourth attempt, using the 30 minutes of free wifi in the Johannesburg airport while I can. &amp;nbsp;Here's what I meant to post yesterday: I wrote this awesome, last post yesterday afternoon, then as soon as I hit submit, the webpage locked up and I lost the entire post.&amp;nbsp; So I re-wrote the whole thing super quick before heading off to a Fourth of July barbeque, but, as I hit submit, I lost internet connection and lost the entire post.&amp;nbsp; Here's my third attempt at telling you guys how this past week went: Right now it's 4:45 am and I'm sitting in the Raleigh airport (for the 6th time this summer) on my way to New York to make my flight later this morning to Johannesburg, South Africa.&amp;nbsp; I'm running on 90 minutes of sleep and so excited and nervous and in disbelief that I'm leaving for an entire month.&amp;nbsp; This last week was crunch time for me, because I needed to get as much done as possible before taking off and totally forgetting where I'm at with my project.&amp;nbsp; It was a long week, but I broke some serious ground, so I feel like I'm leaving at a good spot.&amp;nbsp; One of my biggest goals for this summer was to have a preliminary abstract for AGU before leaving, and that got accomplished this week!&amp;nbsp; I finally got my codes de-bugged so they produce some data that makes sense!&amp;nbsp; Now I have quantitative details about infrasound in the area that I can actually use to start drawing conclusions, which is awesome. I feel like I've finally gotten through the hardest part of my project, but Danny and Jonathan have been giving me some good advice on moving forward from here, which they both say is actually the most difficult part.&amp;nbsp; Now, like a real scientist, I have to figure out what my data signify in order to draw an important conclusion.&amp;nbsp; I have to investigate the interesting or questionable signals and try to come up with the story of where they came from and why they arrived at the array at the time they did.&amp;nbsp; I've been doing a lot of reading about infrasound propagation in the atmosphere, which is really complicated, but very interesting. &amp;nbsp;Just before I left I started grouping events in clusters to start thinking about possible sources in the area and calculate azimuth ranges to put in my AGU abstract. &amp;nbsp;When I get back, I hope to look into this more to see if I can credit some of the high inclination angles to refractions/reflections in the stratosphere (or higher). Outside of lab, this week was...humid.&amp;nbsp; It has been so hot and the humidity is just stifling.&amp;nbsp; I find myself looking forward to going to the desert, which is sad.&amp;nbsp; But I'm still managing to enjoy my summer while I can.&amp;nbsp; On Thursday, Jonathan, Rebecca, and I went to Occaneechee Park, which Jonathan calls "The Yellowstone of North Carolina."&amp;nbsp; It was really gorgeous, and great to get out in the morning and hike before work.&amp;nbsp; We were so ridiculously afterward, though.&amp;nbsp; Then yesterday I went over to Jonathan's for a pre-fireworks barbeque.&amp;nbsp; Classic Lees lab: why waste a good explosion?&amp;nbsp; After work on Thursday we set out a seismometer, a geophone station, and three infrasound sensors to see what kind of signals we pick up.&amp;nbsp; The fireworks were awesome--not quite the same as detonating a shockwave-producing TNT explosion, but still cool. smiley So, this is it, I don't know when/where/if I'll have internet in the coming month, but I will try to sneak in an update if I can. &amp;nbsp;I tried to add pictures to this post the previous three times I submitted it, but I think that's why I was having problems, so I had to cut them out. &amp;nbsp;Other than that, see you in August!</summary>

    <summary>Assignment #5: Free write Lately, I have been figuring out the best plan for dealing with large events, such as earthquakes, in our data. There are many ways large events can be found, such as comparing our time windows with times in a global earthquake catalog, or searching for anomalies in the amplitude or frequency of the raw traces or their correlations. Once found, the events can either be left alone, dampened so their amplitude matches the noise around it, or removed from the data entirely. I have been looking at the correlations after various methods of dealing with these events in an attempt to determine which way will help us most in seeing the body waves for which we are looking. The trouble I am frequently facing now is the limits of our computer power and storage. It turns out that the correlations from one year of our seismic data take up nearly three terabytes! Beyond that, further processing of those correlations, such as finding the RMS and stacking the correlations, ends up using suchlarge amounts of memory that MATLAB and our processing cores sometimes get disagreeable. I have yet to be halted, though; I am so far able to split up and alter our functions in order to keep things manageable. Even with all of these things to do, I have still found time for some fun. Last weekend, I visited Boston&amp;rsquo;s Museum of Science, where I saw musical Tesla coils, live tamarins, dinosaur skeletons, and more. I even bought a seismologically relevant souvenir at the gift shop: a t-shirt reading &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not my fault&amp;rdquo; with a picture of a seismogram trace. I am sure that wearing it to work will cause both smiling and the rolling of eyes. I have also learned that Boston is one of the best places in which to celebrate Independence Day. The threat of some serious storms pushed the city&amp;rsquo;s big Fourth of July festival ahead a day, but I was still able to enjoy the patriotic fun on the third. I hung out with some of my new friends and watched the city&amp;rsquo;s incredible fireworks display as it lit up the night over the Charles River.</summary>

    <summary>It has been a while but here is what I have been up to! I met up with the family for a reunion and to celebrate my Dad's birthday in Las Vegas this past weekend. It was really great to see the family and take a couple days off from the computer near the midpoint of my time at USC. I cannot say that I caught up on my sleep while I was there but oh well. Last week I started messing with the Matlab script that I will be using to compute S receiver functions. My lack of experience with Matlab coupled with my nonexistent knowledge of linear algebra made it really challenging to make sense of the whole thing and actually make the script work. Luckily Rob helped me out and we got it to start working earlier this week. In the end we changed a "b" to an "o". Woe is me. But now that the script is working my life has basically been consumed by looking through thousands of traces and either pressing 1 or 0 to keep the trace or get rid of it. I guess this is my first opportunity to contribute my own human error to the proccess. cheeky Here is a little bit of background info on exactly what I am doing. Seismometers measure ground motion in three directions: E-W, N-S and vertical. S waves, or shear waves, are registered mostly on the horizontal plane, i.e., E-W and N-W. When I say that I am looking at traces, I mean that I am looking at the what each component of the siesmometer has recorded. I am focusing on the E-W and N-W traces and looking for distinct blips that would indicate an S wave arrival. Here are some examples of what I am looking for and what I never want to see. &amp;nbsp; The blips I am looking for, then some ugly noisy garbage, then the classic flatline, and then the art you can get IF you're lucky. Unfortunately, the pictures on my blog aren't working right now so the first and middle picture are missing... maybe I will fix that later. Maybe. Either way these are the kinds of squiggles that I am sifting through.&amp;nbsp; I have run into two problems while I have been working with the S wave data. The first one is not so bad. Basically some of the seismometers were either too close or too far away from the event that they were recording. We are looking for a distance between 55-86 radians. Any event where all/most of the distances are outside of this range goes into a "notgoodevents" folder and therefore is taken out of our dataset. They are also joined by ugly traces. The second problem that I have been having is more annoying but happens less often. Some of the event folders are missing station information either because some components were not recording or because certain component data was not retrieved by our script. Basically, some of the events are missing data and making the script crash. In order to fix this I have been going into the event folders and looking through 100 or so SAC files to try and figure out which station is missing information. It's basically a big matching game. In the end both of these problems mean getting rid of data which is bittersweet because we want as much data as we can get so that our results are reliable but at the same time getting rid of data will make calculations go a little big faster in the future. In conclusion, the P receiver funtion script is still running... BUT there is finally an end in sight. Even though I am a day early, HAPPY FOURTH!! Cheers, Carolyn</summary>

    <summary>This has been a good week so far. Writing code in matlab is becoming an easier task and I can do most of it on my own now. I am also learning how to make plots very neat so when the time comes for making my AGU poster, I will be ready for that. The 4th of July is tomorrow so I will probably see what my roommates are doing and plan something for the weekend. Last week I went to Newberry and saw an awesome shield volcano.

    <title>Weeks 4,5 Lead up to Alaska! - Rebekah_Lee</title>

    <summary>I did a lot of reading last week trying to wrap my head around the theory behind Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) which is what we will really be testing out to see if we can use it to monitor the thickness of the active layer. &amp;nbsp;It was a little frustrating trying to find the references I had from a document that came out of European Research project (SESAME). I tried reading a few other articles with minor success. I still have a lot to study in order to become an "expert" on this topic (since this is what my poster is all about!), but that's what learning is all about so it's ok. This past week has been a little more exciting. I have been working a lot with code. Some of the data collection for this project has been ongoing and we have data going back to October. I learned how to use Geopsy to make H/V plots and then how to do the same thing using a command line. My next task was to have this be an automated process. The trouble was that every time I ran the code it asked me if I wanted to override the previous parameters file. I tried running the code without a parameter file and this problem went away, but we weren't totally sure what parameters Geopsy was actually using. So Rob brought another programming language out called EXPECT. As you may infer, it "expects" to get an interactive question and answers that question according to what you tell it to do. I needed to run basically the same code over and over again and just change a number at the end in a couple of places. We decided to go with the easy choice in tis case and just write out all the commands we needed to run. I used excel to do this in just a few minutes since excel is smart at recognizing counting patterns! Then I saved it as a text file and we had our commands. Now we just needed expect to go through and run each line one at a time. This was a little more complicated, but with help from an expert coder (Thank you Kim!) we finally got the code to run! As I write this it is just finishing up the last couple lines! Now that we have a code that works we can reuse this again as we tweek the parameters and use it for all the stations! Now I just need to import into matlab and plot it ; ). For some reason there doesn't seem to be a way to save the image that you would get if you went through the interface. The documentation is rather sparse. We've also been getting ready for our big trip up to Alaska! I am so excited! We'll be there all next week collecting data. Hopefully I'll be able to give quick updates since we wont be camping out in the wilderness! Just hope the weather holds up as there is a forecast for cool weather and rain! We've got a contingency day built in but I am hoping everything will go well and we'll get to do a little site seeing. I still can't believe I get to go to Alaska!!!</summary>

    <summary>Week #5 has certainly had its ups and downs. On Monday and Tuesday, I spent most of the day trying to use a previously written MATLAB function, but could not figure it out. I finally was able to compile a script using the function and it did not do what I was thought it did which was obviously frustrating since I had essentially wasted two days. Fed up with searching, I just started to write my own functions and it is going pretty well so far. My advisor also helped me write a perl script to automate getting data from Antelope, but I am having trouble writing variations on my own. Instead, I have been using MATLAB to do the same thing, which is perhaps more complicated, but I actually know the syntax, so the learning curve is not quite as steep. It is a little scary that I only have one month left, but I'm hoping the end of my project will soon be in sight and I can begin writing my abstract and designing my poster.</summary>

    <summary>I have finally completed all of the programs I need to gather station data, autocorrelate, and stack. &amp;nbsp; In my arsenal: MATLAB code to build URL to download station data, SAC Macros to convert from velocity to displacement, MATLAB code to Autocorrelate, Shell Scripts to organize the data, stack, and then delete the raw data. &amp;nbsp; I will be processing 150 TA stations for around two years of data. &amp;nbsp;Each data set is around 10 GB and takes around 19 hours on the CERI Macs. &amp;nbsp;After my first dry run of gathering station R43A, I will hopefully use the HPC (High Power Computer) to run the rest at a much quicker rate. &amp;nbsp; Unfortunately I cannot use more than 50 GB on the CERI Macs so I will need to quickly delete the data when I am done processing it. &amp;nbsp; While I wait for the 19hours of gathering the first data set, I will be trying to make my code more efficient and allow more automated processes. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>Better late than never, right?&amp;nbsp; Last week was kind of a blur.&amp;nbsp; My days were so full that they seemed to just fly by.&amp;nbsp; I got back from Buffalo last Saturday, then woke up Sunday morning with a terrible cold.&amp;nbsp; I think all of the traveling finally caught up to me--I was almost expecting to get sick with how busy and exhausted I've been.&amp;nbsp; So I was pretty miserable Sunday, and it only got worse on Monday, so I came home from the lab a little early and slept all afternoon.&amp;nbsp; Apparently sleep was exactly what I needed, because I felt much better Tuesday...back to the lab!&amp;nbsp; All week I worked on my project (with the New Mexico data) while everyone else scrambled to organize the massive amount of data we collected in the field.&amp;nbsp; It was kind of cool, because last week, for the first time, I felt not only independent, but capable.&amp;nbsp; While Jonathan and Danny and Rebecca worked on their own projects, I found myself solving my own problems and figuring things out by myself.&amp;nbsp; Coming in, I knew pretty much nothing about programming or analyzing infrasound signals, but last week I realized that I finally know enough to not have to ask for help every time I'm stuck.&amp;nbsp; It's not like I don't get stuck anymore (let's just say it's a bumpy road where if I don't run into a problem I get suspicious), but I have the tools to figure out what's wrong with my code or where I need to tweak my equations.&amp;nbsp; Sure, sometimes it takes me a long time to find that one little bug in my code that's messing everything up, and I'm tempted to go ask Jonathan how to fix it because I know he could find it in minutes, but it feels so satisfying when I find it myself and get things working on my own.&amp;nbsp; Last week I was able to finalize the code that sorts my signals, pulls up only the good ones for me to make arrival time picks, saves those picks to run through my celerity code, and spits out azimuth, inclination, and celerity for each event.&amp;nbsp; That's huge!&amp;nbsp; But, of course, there's much more to do, because now I have to decide how I'm going to use the results and what conclusions I want to draw from them. Life was pretty busy outside of the lab last week as well.&amp;nbsp; I had to write and turn in my senior thesis prospectus, which is super exciting, but also difficult when I've been thinking about my project here so much.&amp;nbsp; There's also a lot to organize for the big trip to Namibia, so I've been running around taking care of boring last minute details.&amp;nbsp; We found out that we won't be able to get an invitation into Angola, which means we can't get our visas and won't be able to go.&amp;nbsp; Namibia will be fantastic, though, so I'm still just as excited and anxious and nervous as before.&amp;nbsp; Thursday I went out to lunch with Rebecca to watch the sad USA vs. Germany loss.&amp;nbsp; I don't follow soccer at all, but every one of the guys I live with watches religiously, so I've been getting into it.&amp;nbsp; Then Friday night we had a girls night and just hung out, drank champagne in pajamas, and binge-watched Orange is the New Black which is SO ADDICTING, do not start it if you have a big project you need to finish...or start it anyway like me and watch the whole first season in three days...&amp;nbsp; I also cooked an artichoke for the first time in my life.&amp;nbsp; Let's just say it was an interesting experience.</summary>

    <title>Week Two and VEDAUWOO! - Emma Myers</title>

    <summary>Today is the last day of my second week at CSU! As I'm starting to get more involved with my project here are some more details, the nitty gritty about the data and the processing that will be used... The dataset that I will be working with this summer includes seismic recordings from various networks/stations throughout Antarctica. We are in the process of downloading data from several networks, each with it's own functioning time period: POLENET YT (2007 to present), Erebus ER (2002 to present), Southberg XV (2003 - 2006), AGAP ZM (2007 to 2012), as well as a few other stations that will give us data from time periods before those above. Each of these networks has many stations within them, and those then have many channels. As you can tell, there is just a whole heck of a lot of data! And as we began processing it, we realized that some of it was just too large, taking too long, and ultimately wasn't necessary for our studies. So within some networks we would only use data stations, not conditions stations (temperature, pressure, etc). We would also only select the highest sampling rate for each station, because that would give us the most complete dataset. What has been the greatest hurdle is making sure we are getting all the data from POLENET. Some of it is restricted and it's hard to tell if you've actually got all the data or are missing some. Therefore a lot of this data is available to the public, however some is not. I doubt we are the first people to look at most of this data, but perhaps some more recent POLENET information is less analyzed. The data is all raw as far as I'm aware. We wil be cross correlating events with an already made code by the NEIC/USGS, but I'm sure I will have to do some manual picking for alignment purposes. Tools that I will use to do my summer research are many! Just within terminal I am using a lot of different programs, gsac, sac, pico, etc. I am also using Java a great deal, which is where we run our subspace detector coding and made our getfetch requests of the data. Matlab has been the best resource for making my basemap and interpreting the background seismicity so far with Gutenberg-Richter relations and the magnitude of completeness. I am sure it will continue to be a vital program - we even installed the student edition on my personal laptop. I'm excited to play around with it; maybe someday get as good at generating scripts as Nicole... GMT will definitely be needed later on for figures. But due to my lack of current enjoyment with that program, we will just say that and move on... Outside of the internship, I have officially made friends! I guess it's not that surprising that many of the people I have met are also summer interns or part of an REU (Reserach Experiences for Undergraduates). We come from all over, France, Puerto Rico, throughout the US, etc etc and yet seem to understand the process we've all been going through this summer. Two of the students from France, Robin and Tony, invited me to go bouldering last Thursday at Carter Lake and then up to Vedauwoo, &amp;nbsp;near Laramie, WY, for the weekend. I have already had such a blast with these two. Brushing up on my French, I have found people I can joke around with and also climb hard with. It was a fun weekend of getting lost, drinking wine, making ratatouille at our campsite on a tiny stove, accidently getting on a 12c/d sport route when we meant to be climbing the 11b next to it, learning the basics of dancing salsa from Tony, midnight roof crack bouldering, and even later dancing under the stars and a disco ball that their friend Ryan just happens to keep in his car for moments like these. The Brewer's Festival was this weekend, but I have to say that the adventures I had in Wyoming could not compare and I'm not too bummed I missed it. Instead, I am excited to get back up there to climb more. Hoping to get some data to start playing around with in the next couple days. I need to feel like I'm making progress again... Soon enough! I need to not worry and just remind myself I am only just finishing week two, and I have plenty of time left!</summary>

    <summary>I returned from the workshop last Friday after a couple of days of science talks toward its end and a delayed flight to Los Angeles. On the way into the valley, we had the fortune to spot the San Andreas, a telltale gorge across the mountains. The following Sunday, yesterday, other IRIS interns in New Mexico, our advisors, New Mexico Tech faculty, and other seismologists met for a barbecue near campus, at the residence of Drs. Bilek and Spinelli. It helped to catch up with fellow interns who I have not seen since orientation and discuss our projects with the faculty present, green chile cheeseburgers aside.</summary>

    <summary>I was able to get the autocorrelation MATLAB code working with minimal problems. &amp;nbsp;Now I am stacking the data. &amp;nbsp; First I stacked it with a few days, then a week. &amp;nbsp;Both yielded some signs of reflectors, but the process takes about 5 hours to gather the data, process it, and then stack it for only a month's worth of data. For week 5, I will be making Macros, Awk commands, and more Matlab code to streamline this process. &amp;nbsp; The Gui code is not working at all, so I will be simply plotting them in SAC and print screening them to get the images. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>This week I ran into a few different snags with my runs. At first I thought I was a genius beacuse I was able to come up with about 6 fault plots in one day. I later found out that I'm only 80% genius because I was deleting the runs way before they could properly write out necessary information for an accurate fault plot and over all statisic plot for the given data. So I had to delete all output files and start over. I now know that each run takes a few hours, not seconds. Now I'm in the process of contrasting my models without tremor to my models with tremor, hopefully we'll see some sort of difference.The programming is going fine I would say, navigating around with unix gets easier everyday. My living situation is beautiful I'm not sure if I mentioned it before but my apartment has the most beatiful courtyard with several flowers, palm trees and pool. It's like an oasis when I go back home.</summary>

    <summary>Assignment #4: Discuss where the training wheels have been removed This week, I feel like more has gotten done. I am more familiar with what I am doing, and I have laid enough foundation to get into bigger stuff. I have now written a function that will plot every stack of correlations pertaining to any one chosen station; each stack is plotted against time, and they are all arranged by the separation between stations, so waves present in the ambient noise are visible in their propagation outward from the first station, which acts like a wave source because of the correlation. So far, with the small amount of data I have fully processed, I am only able to see surface waves, but when I have correlated and stacked more data and found the right frequency range with which to filter, body waves should appear clearly. Instead of the measly seven days of data I was using to write and test functions before, I now have access to the full 2,920 days we have for this project. I am certainly not using them all right away, though; I will continue using moderate amounts of data, perhaps a month&amp;rsquo;s worth or so, as I continue to adjust the parameters of my functions in order to extract the body waves most clearly. In order to process these new, larger amounts of data, I have also been given more computing power. Before, I was running things one at a time on the machine at my desk, but now I have access to a twelve-core cluster with which I can run my correlations more quickly in parallel. I have also made strides in work-life balance lately. I went out to some neat places over last weekend, such as the New England Aquarium and Boston&amp;rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts. I am a big fan of both cuttlefish and French impressionism, so getting to see both (and other cool things) in real life was amazing. There are many more interesting attractions in this city that are on my to-do list for free time in the future! I am progressing socially here, too; I was introduced to the department&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cookie hour,&amp;rdquo; allowing me to meet more people and hear about more research, and I also made contact with some friends of mine that go to other colleges in the Boston area. In addition, I made some fun new friends by joining the MIT marching band as a bass drummer; the band is small, meets one evening a week, and has kindly allowed me to join them even though I will only be here for the summer. Despite the fact that I will be spending a lot of time alone at my computer for this research, it looks like I will be able to avoid becoming a total recluse.</summary>

    <summary>As I near the end of week #4, I feel that I have made a lot of progress. I am becoming more proficient in MATLAB, Unix, and Antelope and learning more about my project every day. The primary challenge I have faced has been something simple: asking questions. After my first few days, I had so many questions that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know where to start. I got off to a slow start because I tried to figure everything out myself; however, I feel that I am moving much more freely and am able to function on my own. Although I have previous MATLAB experience, I am learning a lot of new things that I&amp;rsquo;m sure will help me in the future. One thing I definitely feel that I could improve on is time-management. I spend a fair amount of time waiting for code to run and about half of the time is spent reading about upcoming NBA free agency on the Internet. This time could (and should!) be used to do other things, but I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what yet. Hopefully this bad habit will be eradicated sometime next week.</summary>

    <summary>Rounding out the 4th week, I have made progress analyzing the earthquake data in MATLAB. So far, the coding has been challenging in some respects, but I think I am getting the hang of it. This coding includes plotting the data on lat/lon maps, creating Schuster plots, filtering the data with respect to space and time, and filtering the data with respect to other earthquake locations. The project overall coming along pretty well. I am spending extra time organizing data so I can quickly remember what exactly I did over the summer when time comes for AGU. In addition, the way I am organizing data is useful because I can create a loop in MATLAB that filters out all the data locations at once (I am studying different places around the country). This is a good way to save time when it comes to long coding blocks that can take hours to complete. My living situation is great. There is a convenient Safeway only four blocks away from where I live. That store has surely been a life saver.</summary>

    <title>Visiting the “G Den” and Data Downloading - Emma Myers</title>

    <summary>Nicole and I went down to Golden, CO yesterday to visit the NEIC. I am still in the works of getting personal access to the building, but was quickly accepted to the group of wonderful college-aged interns working at the USGS/NEIC this summer. As residents of "FoCo" (Fort Collins), USGS intern Sam dubbed Golden "G Den," unpleased that there was no associated abbreviation with Golden. The intern office is very quiet and motivated, so Nicole and I forced them out of the office and out to lunch, something they had yet to do together. All nine of us went to the Sherpa House and had the most filling, and delicious $10 Nepali/Indian buffet. After seconds, and thirds for some, it was agreed that this lunch was infinitely better than any pb&amp;amp;j. But now down to business! Harley Benz, whom Nicole is working with on Oklahoma data, started by giving us a tour of the basement computer rooms. I felt like I was staring up at many versions of the great black monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Their computer setup is amazing, and so incredibly backed up against any failure. This is necessary since they are such a national and global force in earthquake response. Harley then showed us the difference between portable and permanent seismic stations. He then explained how they process and share earthquake information, the scary steps that go into publishing this vital information to hundreds of thousands of people with a click of a button; the White House, the press, the public, etc etc. It was pretty amazing to see how quickly they can provide so much information. Much of the data that I'd been introduced to in my geophysics classes at school, through the earthquakes.usgs.gov website, is processed, analyzed, reassessed, and published within tens of minutes. Very impressive to say the least. Harley explained this is quite the norm around the NEIC. Even with the big 7.9 in Alaska on Monday, he didn't have to even leave his office to handle this process. This kind of visit really made me want to continue my involvement with the NEIC even after this internship is over. What they do is truly amazing. Now I didn't get much done at the NEIC. I did get some new event and station data for my basemap. But with the discovery of Bedmap2, GMT has been abandoned for this assignment (thank goodness), and I pursued putting all of my initial data onto this reference map. Bedmap2 is truly an amazing toolbox used through Matlab that makes easy maps of Antarctica. Who knew that the south pole was such a pesky place to plot.... Anyway! Here is my initial map! I wanted to add a legend for the symbols (Triangles are stations - magenta are POLENET and yellow are OTHER, Circles are past events), but since the symbols were ploted on top of the bedmap, it is likely a task to do later in Illustrator, as Nicole and Rick tell me. We have also been given the okay to start downloading our data! So after I made my map for us and we bought a new 2TB external drive for all of data, we began the slow process of downloading it all. Station by station. Year by year. It's going to be slow. That's okay. We've got pandora open, a webinar to watch, and plenty to do. Our hopes are to finish the downloading by Friday, when we return to the NEIC, so that we can give it Harley to put it into a format that we can use in our codes. It's all very exciting to finally be producing things, like this silly little map and files of data for future processing. We will need to create a script to run the downloading even after we leave the lab today... We'll see how it goes!</summary>

    <summary>Currently I am starting inversion. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to start putting all of the hard work and gruelling monotony of picking PmPs in the seismic data to use. The first few runs will be preliminary, and I will probably have to make some changes. However, after a few tweaks I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to produce a model I can work with. I might also find it necessary to make additional picks with more station/event combinations. Since most of my time here has been making picks, there has been some challenges and success. The most challenging aspect has come from interpreting the seismic data when it gets very &amp;lsquo;noisy&amp;rsquo;. The geology of the mid-ocean ridge is quite complex so I get a lot of abnormal and sometimes hard to correlate results. Anytime I encounter something new and interesting William will help me find the PmPs, and that will usually help me correlate with the adjacent shot-lines. There has been a lot of success getting used to tlPicker though. I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to become very independent and quick in the program&amp;rsquo;s MATLAB menu and environment. Using the menu and tools I can quickly make the data easier to interpret, it&amp;rsquo;s just sometimes making it easy to look at still doesn&amp;rsquo;t make the complexity go away.</summary>

    <summary>Now that I am approaching the midpoint of my internship, I am finally getting into the swing of things. Right now I am processing my data for earthquakes greater than magnitude 5.5 in my study area along the Mexican subduction zone in order to compute the source time functions. I will later analyze these source time functions to figure out the duration of each earthquake. From that said analysis, I hope to find some slow slip earthquake events, which have longer than average rupture durations. I have been using Unix and SAC to edit already existing scripts so that I can process the waveform data I downloaded from WILBER off the IRIS website. I have been using vi editor to edit the specific event time, location and focal mechanism information for each earthquake. I have around 52 events from 1990 to the beginning of June for my analysis. The commands and scripts that I have been using are used to extract the waveforms from the .seed file I downloaded from WILBER, perform initial corrections on the waveforms, and source deconvolution using theoretical Green&amp;rsquo;s functions. I am happy to say that I am now more comfortable and confident using Unix commands and SAC. I have come to realize this when an undergrad student started working for my mentor last week. She was in the same boat I was in when I started my internship; she knew nothing about computers or seismology. So, as she was going through some tutorials that my mentor gave her to do, I was able to help her with any questions that she had and also pass along some helpful hints that a few graduate students gave me.</summary>

    <title>Week 3- RMR Conference - Rebekah_Lee</title>

    <summary>Wow, last week was a whirlwind ride for sure. I went to a conference right here in Albuquerque and then took a crazy trip to the Grand Canyon and a few other places over the weekend. I was fortunate to &amp;nbsp;be able to attend the Review of Monitoring Research (RMR) for Ground-Based Nuclear Explosion Monitoring last week. This was my first experience at a conference. It was mostly poster sessions with a plenary sessions in the mornings and workshops on the last day of the review. This was not conference but a review and so was not open to the public. I was glad to have the opportunity to attend. Since I am just beginning to learn about seismology I think the most valuable aspect of the review was the exposure both to the review and to different aspects of seismology. I think I had vaguely heard about the Nuclear-Test-Ban treaty but knew nothing about it. The review was geared for people who already knew a lot about it but I did learn a few things. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was adopted in 1996 but has not yet been ratified. As I understood it, there is a lot research going on to try to identify a nuclear weapon test and establish procedures for a possible on site investigation. Reading the posters was a challenge since there were so many terms and techqniques I either haven't heard of or don't understand yet. However, being able to talk to the author really helped to be able to understand the gist of the posters and was really interesting. There were a lot of posters on developing better velocity models for various regions (mostly in Asia) and one on a technique to be able to easily recognize a bolide (meteorite) through a technique that honestly went way above me but was cool to see the results. The workshops were rather difficult to grasp but I did learn a little bit about the Source Physics Experiment (SPE) and the different phases. It's crazy to think about, but I could have a PHD in time for phase 3 when they will drill down to where an earthquake occured and set off an explosion to be able to directly compare the two kinds of events. I think that's the most exciting part of the experiment! My goal this summer is to both work hard and play hard, so now here's a little bit of the play part. I had met another Sandia intern outside of SNL at a meetup hike who also wanted to go visit the Grand Canyon. She also had a conference last week but because of my schedule this past weekend seemed to be the best time for me to go (before things really get crazy with my project when we collect the data in July). We scrambled friday to switch gears and get packed and on the road to the south rim. We got a late start but managed to see so many things. This trip was an exploration more than a vacation to a particular place. I am still amazed at everything we managed to pack into the weekend. I'll just put a bulletined list of everything we did here. Saw the Petrified Forest and saw some nearby ruins saw the Grand Canyon for the first time ever by helicopter Saw a small elk Camped in the national forest in a random spot Visited the South Rim on foot and took a very short hike into the canyon Saw a Condor Visited Desert View Watchtower- Mary Colter was the architect and modeled it after traditional Hopi construction Drove to North Rim and enjoyed incredible scenary along the way, it was 101 in one place we stopped to take pictures of the Navajo bridge Saw a heard of Bison cross the road watched the Sunset on the North Rim (Same day we hiked briefly in the South Rim) Stuck around the lodge on the North Rim for a star party, saw cool formations of stars, satelites, shooting stars, nebulas, a ring from the ejected outer layer of a dead star and Saturn (I was most excited about Saturn) Visited Antelope Canyon on Navajo land</summary>

    <summary>Sorry for getting behind with updating the blog--the past couple of weeks have been insanely busy in the lab. &amp;nbsp;Last Saturday we traveled to Buffalo, New York to take part in an international volcanological initiative, which was absolutely awesome. &amp;nbsp;So, leading up to last week, there was little time to work on my project as the whole team was needed to test our equipment before the trip. &amp;nbsp;We tested everything outside of the geology building on campus and then loaded it all into a car and drove to a farm outside of Chapel Hill where we set off some dry ice bombs to collect infrasound and seismic data. &amp;nbsp;Did you know you can buy dry ice at the grocery store? &amp;nbsp;Anyway, the tests were successful, so we packed our microphones and seismometers very carefully for a week of observing some real TNT explosions. We hauled all of our infrasound and seismic equipment up north to participate in a week-long field campaign where groups of researchers from around the world came to collect data and collaborate. &amp;nbsp;The bulk of the field work was done in a rural open field in Springville, New York, which is about a half an hour away from Buffalo. &amp;nbsp;We had a few days to set up, and two official blasting days to collect data. &amp;nbsp;It was hectic with so many different groups all collecting different things at the same time, but also very exciting. &amp;nbsp;Over 20 explosions were detonated, ranging in size and burial depth, strategically placed amongst 5 separate blasting pads. &amp;nbsp;I think our group brought the most equipment, so our setup was pretty extensive. &amp;nbsp;We had a "far" array of 3 infrasound microphones and a seismometer connected to a Reftek data logger, which we placed about 50 meters from the blasts in the middle of some tall grass. &amp;nbsp;It was a nice surprise each morning coming out to put batteries in each of the microphones and finding slugs and grasshoppers crawling all over them...there are some weird bugs living in Springville, NY, and they obviously didn't like me because I left each day covered in bites. &amp;nbsp;On the first day, I got stung by something weird and my whole hand swelled up. &amp;nbsp;It looked like a balloon, or like one of those cartoon Mickey Mouse hands. &amp;nbsp;Pretty gross. We also had a "near" array of 5 infrasound microphones that we set on the ground closer to the explosions. &amp;nbsp;Then, in order to observe the vertical propagation of sound waves, the microphones that will fly on the NASA project at the end of summer were placed in soft-sided lunch boxes and mounted to a 25 foot flagpole in three locations (top, middle, bottom) to create our "flag" array. &amp;nbsp;It was kind of a crazy setup, something no one had ever tried before, but it ended up being super successful. &amp;nbsp;As if we didn't have enough equipment, we were given accelerometers and another seismometer from PASSCAL to observe the explosions, so we had to collect data from these as well. &amp;nbsp;The two accelerometers that PASSCAL gave us were super nice and expensive so we had to be careful with them, but we were curious to see how the ground accelerates really close to the explosion site. &amp;nbsp;We decided to build two cheap accelerometers of our own which could be blown up without consequences. &amp;nbsp;I hadn't used my knowledge of circuits and electricity from freshman year physics since the class ended, and suddenly I was using my hands to solder things to a circuit board. &amp;nbsp;I loved the hands-on aspect of electronics, and I feel like I actually gained some practical knowledge. &amp;nbsp;I don't think I will ever find myself soldering in a hotel room ever again--quite an adventure. After a few long days in the field and lots of sunburn, we packed up our equipment and celebrated with ice cream and cold beer. &amp;nbsp;Then, on Thursday, we took some time to be tourists and trekked over to Niagara Falls, which was gorgeous. &amp;nbsp;We had perfect weather, and spent the day walking around and enjoying the falls. &amp;nbsp;But, of course, in a group full of scientists everything becomes an experiment, so we took one array with 6 microphones with us to collect some infrasound from the falls. &amp;nbsp;Two other groups came with us--one brought an infrared camera to do thermal imaging of the falls, and the other brought a high speed camera. &amp;nbsp;I was walking around with a Reftek shoved in my backpack as we moved between three different sites within the park. &amp;nbsp;We definitely got some weird looks when we laid out all of our equipment. &amp;nbsp;I'm sure some people thought we were crazy. &amp;nbsp;It was a great day, though, and produced some cool data. &amp;nbsp;Also, that night we went out for buffalo wings in Buffalo, which turned into a challenge of who could eat the hottest wings--seriously hilarious adviser-intern bonding. Although the week was unbelievably exhausting, I had such an amazing time meeting people from around the world and learning more about other types of volcanological research. &amp;nbsp;I was by far the youngest person there, but I loved being able to get to know scientists from different backgrounds and hear their advice and perspectives on going into a career in geophysics. &amp;nbsp;The week was extremely valuable to me in so many ways. &amp;nbsp;The blasters let me detonate not just one, but two of the biggest explosions on the last day, which pretty much made my week. &amp;nbsp;But, even better than that, I made connections with an amazing group of researchers while experiencing all the stress, hard work, and reward of being in the field. P.S. I have so many cool pictures and videos I want to share, so hopefully I can figure out how to get them on here--next entry should be way less words, way more pictures&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>On Tuesday 6/17 my mentor and I took a trip to UC Riverside . There was a group meeting &amp;nbsp;that included a number of people working with the earthquake simulator, RSQSim. It gave me a chance to meet some of the other people working with the earthquake simulator and learn about their projects. I spoke with with Jim, Keith, and Kayla specifically about my work this summer. On Wednesday I wasn't feeling too well so I was able to work for home on tweaking my shear and normal stress parameters for the simulation. I think I'm getting the hang of creating the scripts. I'm also in the process of applying for the AWG scholarship.</summary>

    <summary>...As a spectator, but an enchanted air still pervades the whole situation. Since arriving at Stanford, I have juggled both my coding exercises and the CIG workshop in an increasingly independent manner, even though I maintain close contact with Dr. Roy in my progress, and the week is much less of a wbusiness trip than an opportunity to take a break and view the machinations of academic computational geodynamics. In the process thus far, by osmosis, I have absorbed a tremendous deal of knowledge in CUBIT/Trelis mesh generation and finite-element modeling of faulting: volcano deformation, normal faults in subduction zones, transform faults... Now, as the programming pace picks up, and I face a brand-new living situation for several days hours from anywhere I have ever been, I am occupied at nearly all hours. But I enjoy such work, and the bursts of spontaneous action required to oil the wheels of the workshop experience.</summary>

    <summary>This is my last day of my first week in Fort Collins, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a bit more information about my internship, my goals, and what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to so far! Above you can read my project summary, which is essentially how I understand the project thus far. Unfortunately, I have yet to delve into this data myself, but have been reading up a lot on past research and the methodologies that we will be implementing, as well as practicing with those methods on other data and with Nicole on her research of the induced seismicity in Oklahoma in the past year. Anyway, here are my goals for the summer, both general and specific... My general goals for the internship: - Become familiar, proficient, and largely independent in my data processing and program handling. - Personally become more confident about being self-guided, trusting my intuition/ideas. While at the same time, be confident in asking questions and for guidance when needed. - Make some professional contacts in the field of seismology so that I have a network of people who know who I am and what I am doing for support with my project as well as in future endeavors. - Become more informed about my post internship choices from my advisor&amp;rsquo;s own experience/advice, as well as others who assist me this summer, and my own experiences; these include grad school, industry, research, etc. More specific goals related to each third of my internship (which will last 13 weeks total, June 17th &amp;ndash; September 17th!) - The first third &amp;ndash; I would like to begin with really obtaining a thorough understanding of the area (Antarctica), past resereach, and the methodologies that we will be using to reassess the area and develop upon that past resreach. With that regard, it seems appropriate to learn about different seismic signals/sources and characterizing them (earthquakes vs icequakes). - The second third &amp;ndash; With more of a background in the codes/methods I will be using, I hope to begin retrieving and preparing data for analysis, then applying those developed codes for event detection/catalogue creation. Hopefully I can create some maps and catalogs of data, as well as expand my understanding of my project in my abstract, all things that will help me prepare for AGU. - Final third &amp;ndash; At this point, my abstract for AGU should be finalized and sent in (deadline is August 6th online), and then assess and prioritize my time left for what results will be presented and need follow-up. This will largely be a time of final reflection and analysis, outlining and beginning scientific papers. *These are tweaked from what my advisor has outlined for me, and I am certain that they will quickly blend together throughout the summer, as I already feel like I have become well informed about relevant publications and begun understanding and applying the use of subspace detectors and other correlation/detection techniques we will be using. Also, I will be continuing my internship for more than a month after AGU abstracts will be due, so I hope to be able to really process a lot of information, and provide substantial work towards this project. So far, with a lack of data, I have been working to become familiar with the many programs I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used before, such as coding in Terminal, using bash and editing text files with pico, pulling in metadata, processing it with gsac and sac, and then taking it further with applications of the methodologies of subspace detectors we will be using in Java, scripting in Matlab, and presentation in GMT. I must say GMT has been the biggest struggle for me personally. It is difficult to figure even where to start. The Internet is a good resource for base projects that you can tweak, but there is very poor explanation for why someone made his or her code a specific way. I have made one successful map of Oklahoma and the earthquakes of the past few years in Nicole&amp;rsquo;s research area, as well as a histogram of the magnitudes. This was pretty easy compared to my next step - I will be attempting to understand the program more this week by generating a good base Antarctica map from a file my advisor gave me of the Ross Ice Shelf, expanding the fields over the entire continent so that I can later zoom in and use whatever specific areas I need for the results I find. I hope I can get a bit further with it than I did in my struggles last week. I know this all just takes time and repetitive application to truly become proficient. And as Nicole and my advisor remind me, that&amp;rsquo;s what this summer and being an intern are all about. Tomorrow I head to the NEIC (National Earthquake Information Center) in Golden, CO with Nicole to meet with her advisor and my contact Harley Benz. He has finished the last bit of code we need to process data, and while I wait for government access and my data to be provided to me, I can at least continue practicing with Nicole&amp;rsquo;s Oklahoma data in the meantime. I am excited to go to the NEIC and get a look into what it&amp;rsquo;s like to work for a nationally, if not globally, influential place in the field of seismology. As for personal experiences, I've essentially been embracing the solitude. Still not knowing many people here, I've taken it upon myself to really explore Fort Collins, especially the outdoors. Taking a walk downtown as well as biking, trail running, just laying out catching up on some fun reading (100 Years of Solitude - appropriate in the title at least?) at Horsetooth Reservoir, and enjoying a beer at Odell Brewery. I have met a few people at the school climbing gym, and am looking forward to climbing with them outside sometime this week. More to come in the next few days. Hopefully I will have struggled through a good basemap of Antarctica to use, as well as a map with all of Antarctica's historic background sesimicity... Anyway, something to look forward to: The Brewer's Festival is this weekend and sure to be a good time!</summary>

    <summary>I have successfully downloaded all of my data and I am now in the thick of processing said data. It turns out that this step takes even longer! I started a P recevier function script last Tuesday and I am not very optimistic that it will be done by the end of this week. In the mean time I have been working with surface wave dispersion data and making preliminary maps with GMT to view the results. I have also started setting up directory structures and scripts to compute S receiver functions.&amp;nbsp; This weekend I went on two day trips to explore the San Andreas Fault with the SCEC program. Between seeing some really interesting geologic features, getting free food, waking up at 5 am, getting the bus stuck for over an hour in 102 degree weather, watching some of the best and worst geophysics-related movies ever, and hanging out with friends, the trip definitely had its ups and downs. Fun fact that I learned from this weekend: dates grow on palm trees. Who knew????!!? Definitely not me.&amp;nbsp; Cheers! Carolyn</summary>

    <summary>Most of my work last week was on trying autocorrelation through SAC with different parameters. &amp;nbsp;I tried multiple ranges for the first and second bandpass, different frequency limits for removing the instrument response, and different highpass filters. After running the seismograms by my graduate advisor Blaine, we concluded that it would be a better idea to work on perfecting a code that another grad student years back put together to identify reflectors within large volumes of data through autocorrelation. I have now two sets of MATLAB code: one set deals with the data aquisition and autocorrelation, the second deals with plotting these figures through a GUI. &amp;nbsp; I have spent two days so far on the first set, and I can comfortably say that this student does not like commenting or efficiency with his code. &amp;nbsp; I annotated approximately 90% of the first set of code, and later today I will finish the other 10% and figure out the looping pattern with pen and paper. &amp;nbsp;After that I will move organize the programs and start using it to autocorrelate the data. &amp;nbsp; For any interested, I will be opening up a forum for MATLAB help and suggestions. &amp;nbsp;I can also send anyone the code I am working on with annotations if they want a good reference for seismic analysis code in MATLAB.</summary>

    <summary>Sorry I am a little late... Week three was definitely an interesting week here at SMU. One of the biggest things I have learned about my project is that the conclusions will perhaps have a larger political and social impact than scientific. This project is getting a lot of publicity in the area because seismicity is directly affecting people and the local economy. My advisor was invited to be on a discussion panel including reporters, politicians, and an energy industry representative. The event was sponsored by NPR and StateImpact. There was an audience and the discussion was broadcasted on the radio as well. Throughout the discussion, the panelists were generally met with hostility from the crowd, which consisted of citizens of Azle, Reno, and other nearby towns being shaken by small magnitude earthquakes. People were angry that the temporal correlation between oil and gas activity in the area and unprecedented seismicity is not enough to scientifically prove that oil and gas activity caused the seismicity. Although this may seem obvious to a scientist, they are not to blame for having such strong feelings. This event was certainly eye-opening and in a strange way inspiring. It made me feel like what I am doing could really help people. On a different note, the following day, Heather (my advisor) and I returned to Azle to help teach kids about earthquakes at a science camp and the local library. I was tasked with building an &amp;ldquo;earthquake machine&amp;rdquo; that was interactive and would help kids understand earthquakes better. Not being much of a craftsman, I was not very confident in my ability to make such a machine. Fortunately, I was able to put something together. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too impressive, but it worked and was a hit at the science fair! I think the kids really enjoyed it. Now, I am beginning to cross-correlate data in GISMO, a MATLAB based waveform analysis toolbox. I expect to be doing this for the next few weeks, as this is the bulk of my project. I am very glad that I have experience with MATLAB. I could not imagine how much harder my work would be if I was learning MATLAB throughout these first few weeks. I expect that week four will be a rather frustrating week, but I hope to be productive.</summary>

    <summary>Lately, I have delved into the introductory aspects of the internship: adjusting previous Python code using FEniCS to compute the velocities of rock at given points inside a theoretical mesh. This mesh emulates a right strike-slip fault with mantle flow beneath; by setting boundary conditions accordingly, we can then model the rheology of a simple chunk of crust. From the beginning, it was clear that changing the number of iterations of modeling did not affect the velocities themselves. I managed to vary the mesh's parameters--viscosity distribution, thickness, absolute velocities of the boundaries--and establish just how these parameters affected the output. In addition, I varied the viscosity values of the layers in the model. Here is a random example of a ParaView snapshot visualizing the velocity distribution in a two-layered rheology of double the strike-slip velocity relative to the mantle's velocity, comparing a mesh of 100 km thickness to 400 km thickness. My greatest trouble toward the latter half of this week was in calculating the plane of zero velocity magnitude, where we do not expect motion of the crust, and the velocity tensor. Conceptually, both are simple to address, but the task of converting a .vtu (visual file) into an ASCII file for MATLAB use has worn thin. A slight adjustment to the old Perl code produced a file of irregular dimensions; importing the file in turn produced bugs. Based on today's meeting, the optimal route may be to convert the .vtu file to a spreadsheet within MATLAB before proceeding. The coming week will take me to Stanford for the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics PyLith workshop, and I am nothing less than thrilled to have the chance to be there. The subject matter covers geodynamic modeling as well, so the ideas addressed there, while not directly relevant to the assignments at hand, should be close enough to prove useful. More on this in several days.</summary>

    <summary>As I continue to pick PmPs on the seismic data I get ever closer to a finished product that I can use for inversion. I met with William and Dax, my mentor's graduate student, to discuss the gameplan for the next weeks ahead. I seem to be slightly ahead of schedule and should get to start on an inversion next week! I'm very excited to start on inversion. With inversion I will be able to model crustal thickness and get a better understanding of the areas at and near the ridge. While picking we have already encountered some interesting occourences that we can not explain very well. With the model we might be able to shed some light onto what we are seeing and address the important geological mysteries at hand.</summary>

    <summary>My week has been chaotic, but interesting. First, being in a new city with new germs, I managed to catch a cold and was running on partial zombie mode for several days. Second, my parents, brother, and aunt arrived on Wednesday for their week-long visit. I have been working on my project during the day, then meeting up with them in the evening. We&amp;rsquo;re also going to spend the weekend together, seeing sights, going to museums, and more. While they were planning it months ago, I repeatedly expressed that I would be fine and they did not need to come visit me, but they insisted that they really wanted to and it would be a fun family vacation. I was right that I am fine and they did not need to visit, but I am glad they wanted to; we are having a great time here together. Assignment #3: This week&amp;rsquo;s research and progress I have been continuing the correlating and stacking of data as before, but have been focusing on a new step in between: sorting, which organizes the the correlated data by the pair of stations from which it came. This was happening before, as a part of my stacking step, but making it more separate and organized will smooth things along once we start working with larger and larger sets of data. With a sorted matrix of all of the traces for each pair of stations, I will be able to find events like earthquakes that should be removed before stacking much more easily, and I will be able to backtrack more quickly and easily in case of errors. As I modify and test these functions, I occasionally find myself with some open time as MATLAB cycles through significant amounts of data. Luckily, I have useful tasks with which to fill this time: reading papers on similar research, looking up Wikipedia articles on signal processing, doing more computer tutorials, perusing the seismology textbook I received at IRIS orientation week, and drafting these blog entries. I am getting better and better at MATLAB every day. As I run, edit, and create programs in it, I find myself getting stuck a lot less, asking the postdocs and/or Google for help less frequently, and being able to understand and implement solutions more quickly when I do need help. Perhaps most importantly, I am now much less afraid of doing something wrong in MATLAB, because I have learned that it will not get computer-angry at me, nor will it cause the total destruction of anything. I also got some new tools to play with: SeismicLab, a suite of seismic data processing tools for MATLAB created by researchers in the physics department at University of Alberta. Having only just opened it up, I am not yet familiar with everything its gadgets are capable of or for what I will be using it, but I have been told that it has some great tools for graphing data. Everything I have done so far is about understanding and improving the process that I will eventually be using to find body waves in the full set of ambient noise data. It seems like not a lot has happened yet, but I have a lot of foundation to lay before I can really start making tracks. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>After driving about 20 hours from Bellingham, WA with a stop in Missoula, MT, I have finally made it to Fort Collins, CO for my summer internship! Numerous rest area stops, a couple nervous, fully leaned forward in my seat coastings off exit ramps to gas stations, about a dozen Snap Judgement and ClimbingBeta podcasts, and just about endless singing. I must say that the independent road trip may be a struggle, but it definitely is fun to see how you make it through. I am officially on day 2 of the internship, and though maybe less nervous than I was initially, I am still very excited. The general explanation of my internship is that I am working with Dr. Rick Aster at Colorado State University and his PhD student Nicole McMahon assessing the seismicity of Antartica. I will also be working down in Golden, CO at the NEIC (National Earthquake Information Center) for this project. Though I haven't seen any of my actual data, I have already been thrown into immense amounts of learning with Nicole using Java, SAC, GMT, Bash, etc etc, practicing the sort of tasks I will be doing with data of West Antarctica. I have a lot to learn, but I'm very thankful that Nicole is eager to help me, will answer any of my silly questions, and is essentially learning along with me on many fronts. It makes the transition to a completely new place, where I know no one, and have no idea where anything is much less intimidating. We started my first day about with a quick chat, tour, and a little computer time before lunch at the Rainbow Cafe across campus. I can already tell that Fort Collins is presenting me with the wonderful challenge of trying a lot of amazing food and perhaps a beer or two - I accept. I'm excited to get to know my advisor and student mentor a bit more. They are both incredibly smart, but I can also tell they will be a lot of fun. We've already discussed climbing together (getting Nicole on the ropes for her second time, and I'm eager to check out Poudre Canyon and Lumpy Ridge), Nicole teaching me a thing or two about basketball (let it be known I'm 5' and very uncoordinated, think I'll learn to dunk?), and we've even discussed getting Rick to try Zumba sometime with us. Let's just say it's going to be a fun summer and we'll all have plenty to learn and enjoy! I will definitely keep you updated, hopefully with documentation of our joys and struggles. Want to know more?! I will post more about my project, my goals, and my general thoughts about the academic side of this internship in my next blog entry at the end of this first week, and of course the nonacademic experiences that arise as I settle into the sunny "Fort Fun" - looking forward to maybe exploring some mountain biking trails this afternoon!</summary>

    <summary>This week I met some other REU students for the materials science (physics and chemistry). Monday was their first day and all of them are in Oregon for the summer, at U of O. They invited me to take some field trips with them throughout the summer, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes. This week we are getting into analyzing the earthquake data. Right now we will see if there is any correlation with earth tides triggering earthquakes. The data we are studying has been filtered based on the time the earthquakes occured over roughly a 30 year period. What we are expecting to see is some evidence earthquakes occur more frequently when the tides are strong (every 12 hours, depending on the tide we are studying) and plot this data on a Schuster plot. We have not factored in the pressure data from nearby injection wells, or fault orientations, but this will give us an idea if earthquakes can be triggered by earth tides.</summary>

    <summary>Sorry about posting this blog entry late I was away most of last week to attend the IRIS workshop in central Oregon. The workshop was a great opportunity for me to meet many graduate students and learn more about IRIS and current seismological research. So far, what I have been using for my internship is GMT. I have already made one map of magnitude &amp;lt;5.5 for the area that I will be studying along the Mexican subduction zone. Also included in the same map are the focal mechanisms for these earthquakes. My mentor is also having me learn how to use vi editor in Unix. Some of the upcoming work that I will be doing includes using vi editor to edit the earthquake events that I have recently requested and received data for from IRIS/WILBER. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>Today I started gathering USArray&amp;nbsp;seismic data from the IRIS database. I am basically aquiring data from every seismometer in my study region that has recorded an event, i.e. an earthquake, in the last 8 years. Needless to say, it is going to take a while to download all of these files. I am going to be manipulating this data with scripts that have already been written by Dr. Robert Herrmann from Saint Louis University or by my advisor Rob Porritt. I will write/use some of my own scripts, but they are going to be extremely simplistic in comparison and will basically just rename/redirect files or run other scripts. Nevertheless, I will definitely get some experience with reading and writing bash scripts. I will be running some of these scripts through a program call gsac which was also written by Dr. Robert Herrmann (apparently he is a really smart guy). Later on I will probably use GMT to create some figures and maps. I am going to be working with the raw data, so I am basically starting from the ground up. I am pretty happy about this because I think that it will enable me to get a pretty sound understanding of whats happening to the data during each step of the process. Enough with the science, I made it to the beach! My sister's friend lives in Santa Monica so I went and visited her this past Saturday. Very long story short, it was really weird and too fun. I also visited my Dad's childhood friend and his family in Encino on Sunday, so not only did I get beach time, but I also got pool time(!) along with some delicious food, a crazy dog that will play fetch until she dies, and some diehard Nascar fans. I took the bus to get to both of my weekend destinations, so all in all I probably spent a solid 4 or 5 hours on the bus. As awful as that may sound, it was actually really nice to get familiar with LA's transportation system and get a bus card for future adventures. Speaking of which, I will be using my bus card to go to a Dodgers game... TONIGHT! Maybe I will start the wave... Cheers! Carolyn</summary>

    <summary>This summer I will utilize the RSQSim which is used to study the effects of both small- and large-scale fault system geometry on recurrence statistics in a idealized but complex fault system. The team I work with here at the USGS and UC-Riverside is the first to simulate tremor so we utilize some seismic data results from David Shelly and Jeanne Hardebeck in order to narrow down the options for parameters we should use. In addition we use results of perameter tests examining slow slip earthquakes with the simulator from Harmony Colella. We use R&amp;nbsp;to interpret our data.</summary>

    <summary>Currently I have been working with a data set collected through R/V Marcus G. Langseth. The ship conducted an experiment on the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge where 68 four-component, ocean bottom seismometers were deployed at 64 sites near and away from the mid-ocean ridge. We are working with researchers from the University of Oregon. We had a conference call the other day, and I got&amp;nbsp; a screenshot for the blog! I am currently picking points from different station/event combinations that cross the ridge axis. It&amp;rsquo;s tedious work, but luckily the world cup just started today so I will have a healthy distraction to not keep from going crazy. We use a program developed by my mentor called tlPicker through MATLAB to make the picks. It is not very fancy, but it gets the job done, and is effective in what we need to do. I haven&amp;rsquo;t started seeing seismic data in my sleep, but I have been seeing flowers by Georgia O&amp;rsquo;keefe.. Black IRIS (no pun intended, although quite conspicuous) ... doesn&amp;rsquo;t it look a lot alike?? I&amp;rsquo;m not going crazy right??</summary>

    <title>Techniques and Tools for the Summer - Rebekah_Lee</title>

    <summary>There are currently 7 stations installed with Nanometrics Trillium Posthole Seismometers and Reftek-130 digitizers. These stations are set up in a triangular array with one station in the center (see one of the fancy maps I created in GMT). They&amp;rsquo;ve been taking data from the ambient noise since October. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using a technique with this data called H/V Spectral Ratio Analysis to track changes in the depth of the active layer (see my profile).&amp;nbsp; While H/V has been used to categorize the vulnerability of an area to shaking caused by an earthquake, using H/V for the depth of permafrost is a new technique. Geophones: The ReMi Method In addition to the data from the permanent stations, I&amp;rsquo;ll be collecting new data with the geophones. This will be an active survey that will, in addition to the pole measurements, act as ground truth for the experimental H/V technique. A FEW TECHNICAL DETAILS Normally geophones are used in refraction surveys but I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the ReMi (Refraction Microtremor) method. The data will be recorded in the time domain and then transferred to the p-tau domain. The p-tau domain is slowness (inverse of velocity) vs what is essentially time. In this domain noise as well as the reflected and refracted waves get stacked out so that just the direct waves are left. This data is then transferred to the p-frequency domain via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then inverted until a velocity model is obtained that matches the data. Tools of the Trade I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;m using GMT to create nice maps for visuals for my poster. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be using GEOPSY for the H/V analysis along with Matlab. I don&amp;rsquo;t know all the details just yet. Big Picture So the point off all this is try to see if this new technique will work for measuring depth to permafrost. If it works it will be a cost efficient way to map and track the permafrost layer through time. There are other geophysical techniques to map it, but these require multiple site visits if you want to track it through time. H/V could work on a daily basis and especially could be used as the US Array is installed in Alaska beginning this year.</summary>

    <summary>Things are starting to pick up here now that my professor and the postdocs are all back from their assorted adventures, so I have moved beyond just reading papers and watching computer tutorials. This week, I have spent a lot of time playing around with some of the existing MATLAB correlation and pre-processing programs, learning what they do, how they do it, and how it will be useful to me. I also wrote my first program, a simple method of stacking the correlations that come out of another program. My program is probably of questionable efficiency, since I am still quite new to this, but I can tell that in the process of making it, I have learned a lot about programming in MATLAB. I have also begun to meet more of the people around here. I work in one corner of a large office, and the graduate students stationed in the other segments of the same office have all introduced themselves to me. When I mentioned to them that I was here through IRIS, I learned that two of the graduate students on this floor were also IRIS interns during their undergrad. Having such a network of IRIS alumni is really a cool thing. Assignment #2: The datasets and tools with which I am working The data with which I am working this summer is from the USArray, specifically from the Transportable Array stations between approximately 40&amp;deg; and 42&amp;deg; N. This continent-wide stripe runs from northern California on the west coast, through my hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, and then on to my current location in Boston on the east coast. Someday, I should try to visit that area in northern California, just so I will have been on both ends and the middle of our area of interest. There are lots of researchers using USArray data, and for good reason; the USArray project is both widespread and comprehensive when it comes to how this country moves. We&amp;rsquo;re starting with the raw data, but luckily for me, most of the pre-processing functions have already been written and will only need parameter tweaking. The primary weapon in my confrontation with the correlations is MATLAB. I will be using and editing code written by the postdocs and others, as well as writing some of my own, in order to piece together body waves from the ambient noise. Within MATLAB, I have use of the GISMO (Geophysical Institute Seismology MATLAB Objects) toolbox, a downloadable collection of functions designed for seismic trace analysis by University of Alaska Fairbanks professors. I have spent a fair bit of time over the past few days dissecting and playing around with GISMO&amp;rsquo;s correlations functions in order to figure out how best to apply them this summer.</summary>

    <summary>For my project, I will be using the NELE data and some of the TA data. &amp;nbsp;I am currently using JWEED to access the data from IRIS. &amp;nbsp; I will be working with approximately two years of raw data at nearly 80 stations. &amp;nbsp;Many faculty at CERI use the NELE data, but as far as I know, I will be the first to deal with such a large quantity of ambient noise data. I will also be using SAC to clean up, correlate, and stack the data. &amp;nbsp;I will be doing most of this through the High Power Computer (HPC) at CERI. &amp;nbsp; To plot and display the data, I will be using both Matlab and GMT. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>We've really gotten to know each other over the past month.&amp;nbsp; Back in May, two large side-by-side screens welcomed me into the lab and provided me with a workspace of my own for the rest of the summer.&amp;nbsp; What started as intermittent flirting has flourished into a full-fledged commitment.&amp;nbsp; We went from seeing each other occasionally throughout the week to spending entire days face-to-face, cultivating an intimate relationship that makes us nearly inseparable.&amp;nbsp; Except when my butt, back, and neck get sore from sitting in this stupid chair and I get sick of working on fixing the same few lines of code for four hours straight and I start staring out the window wondering how loud the crash would be if I threw one of these screens out of it. I believe I've hit the stage in my internship where, now that I have a full grasp of what I'm doing and have jumped into the real work for the summer, things are getting a little rough.&amp;nbsp; My computer and I are definitely out of our "honeymoon phase," and, as in all successful relationships, we'll have to get past our rough patches if we want to become a strong, dynamic power couple.&amp;nbsp; Okay, reading that back just now I realize how weird it is that I referred to myself and my computer as a power couple.&amp;nbsp; I guess what I'm trying to say is that a huge portion of my work this summer will be done at my computer because of the type of data I'm working with.&amp;nbsp; My dataset this summer came to the lab as a hard drive loaded with thousands of files.&amp;nbsp; These have all been downloaded to my computer and contain a record of all infrasound and seismic signals from the Socorro array throughout the months it was functional starting in 2010.&amp;nbsp; So, it's a lot of data to go through, which is why my computer and I have been spending so much time together recently. First, I did a visual sort through all of the signals to look for big events.&amp;nbsp; For this project, I'm mostly interested in distinct events, like explosions, that produce strong, easily detectable signals.&amp;nbsp; These are sure to be picked up by all microphones at the array and will provide the clearest data to work with.&amp;nbsp; To find these events, I used a program called SEISSIG, written by my adviser, which reads in the files and allows me to look through a continuous feed of collected signals.&amp;nbsp; In small increments (minutes at a time) I paged through four years worth of signals.&amp;nbsp; Translated: I clicked through page after page of wiggly lines and picked out the ones that looked like explosions.&amp;nbsp; Once all of these "picks" were saved, I could begin the actual analysis of my data.&amp;nbsp; The bulk of the work I'll be doing this summer will be in R.&amp;nbsp; Using R, I can write my own functions to manipulate the data in ways I see useful.&amp;nbsp; Since returning from New Mexico, I've written a code to sort through the signals I've picked and get rid of any overlaps (ones I may have picked out twice by accident).&amp;nbsp; This shortened my list of picks, but not as much as I'd hoped--I don't want to further analyze thousands of picks when I don't have to, so sorting now is to my advantage.&amp;nbsp; I created another code to examine the signal-to-noise ratio of each signal and sort out the ones with low ratios.&amp;nbsp; Major events like explosions will be very strong and occur very suddenly, so they have a very high signal-to-noise ratio.&amp;nbsp; By eliminating any picks that have low ratios, I've created a more accurate and manageable list to continue working with.&amp;nbsp; With my final list of picks for each year, I'll use another program created by my adviser called SWIG to, again, visually examine the signals.&amp;nbsp; This time, I'll locate and save arrival times of the waves which can be used in my celerity calculation.&amp;nbsp; For other seismologists, SWIG is very similar to SAC except for a few additional buttons and different formatting of data. Like I said, I've been spending a lot of time at my computer trying to work through these programs and teach myself as much as I can.&amp;nbsp; My adviser has been super helpful, answering questions when I need help and generally pointing me in the right direction.&amp;nbsp; Programming is so much more than just learning how to code--for me, it's been more of an exercise in learning how to think logically, which is challenging but (I never thought I'd say it) weirdly enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; So, even though things seem rough now, I don't plan on breaking off the relationship I've established with my computer any time soon.</summary>

    <summary>I concluded that my aging laptop would not remotely suffice for my internship, purchased a brand-new one, and through a coup d'etat, replaced Windows 8 with Ubuntu. Diving head-first into UNIX has been like ripping off a bandage: painful in the short term, but a relief in the long term. Furthermore, in my quest to find the perfect hardware last weekend, I wound up walking around Albuquerque in a continuous eighteen-hour trek. But what an adventure! As soon as I'm able to tunnel into the physics department's computer and solve "some" configuration issues, progress should arrive. Because I model, no data or instruments are required; I rely on FEniCS and ParaView to solve differential equations by finite-element methods and plot the evolution of a theoretical geodynamic system. These software packages are universal among the theorists, particularly at Brown and Columbia. Other students and I also toy around with GMT, for example, in group meetings, and a seminar later this month involves extensive PyLith usage. One more point on my last blog entry: in order to study seismic anisotropy, we often use SKS phase waves reflected off the core-mantle boundary. How come? At the boundary, compressional waves convert into shear waves. We know the initial polarization of these waves, so given the final polarization of the split shear wave, we can speculate on the anisotropy of the material through which the wave passed.</summary>

    <summary>Over the summer, I will be working with ten datasets that contain information on earthquakes&amp;nbsp;that occurred in various places around the country&amp;nbsp;(ten regions total). This information includes the magnitude of earthquakes, location of the earthquakes, time interval, fault orientation, and wellhead pressures from wells near the earthquake epicenters. The time interval in each of the regions is roughly from 2011-2013 when the data was gathered.&amp;nbsp;Because of this,&amp;nbsp;I don't have to start with raw data as&amp;nbsp;different research&amp;nbsp;articles have already compiled the data for me. We had to contact some of&amp;nbsp;the authors in order to get information we needed on some of the data if we could not find it within the paper. We will process these datasets in MATLAB to analyze any correlation between waste injection/hydraulic fracturing and induced seismicity. We will also use MATLAB to analyze tidal modulation of induced seismicity as well. GMT may be used for map making if needed.</summary>

    <summary>Well, I've got a lot to accomplish this summer, and it is always good to set goals to make sure I'm on track to accomplish everything. You can read a description of my project on my profile page. I won't be collecting data for a few weeks so for the first third of the summer I'll be reading a lot to build my up my background knowledge. The topics I'll be reading about include permafrost, ReMi (Refraction Microtremor) and H/V (don't really know what that is at this point!). I'll also be attending a conference here in albuquerque which not only will help with building background knowledge but also help understand one of the major projects going on here at Sandia National Labs.&amp;nbsp; That brings me to another big goal for the summer: start to zero in on what it is I want to do in Geophysics. To accomplish this I'll be meeting as many people as possible and ask a lot of questions about what they do. There are opportunities to meet people informally here at SNL, the conference I'll be attending and also in an additional mentor program I've signed up for! The second and last third of the summer will blend together. I'll be collecting data in Alaska and then it's crunch time.Once I get back I'll be working hard to: 1. Process all the data 2. Finish my poster The goal is to have the poster finished by the end of my internship. &amp;nbsp;To that end, I've already started on it by beginning to prepare a basic map of the location of my research for the poster. That may sound simple but I'm using a program called GMT (Generic Mapping Tools) and it is anything but simple! This is a tool that will come in handy in the future as well as it is commonly used for preparing presentations (or posters!) Finally, looking beyond my time this summer as an IRIS intern, I'd like to identify some possible advisors I'd like to work under for graduate school. So, I need to come up with a list of 10 or so things I'll be looking for in a potential advisor and their research. This should be finished by the second third of my internship. My mentors will give me suggestions of people or places that might be a good match, then I will start to reach out to them either in the last part of the internship or right after. I would love to meet a few at the AGU meeting in December if possible!</summary>

    <summary>This summer, I will be processing passive source seismic time series data by waveform cross correlation. The instruments used to record the signals are primarily accelerometers, broadband seismometers, and short-period seismometers. Some instruments have been recording since 8 November 2013, three days after a swarm of twenty-five earthquakes between magnitude 2.0 and 3.6 were identified in Azle, TX, and continue to record today. From what I understand, this data has been seen by few eyes and is very private due to media coverage of the project. For the past week, I have been picking events and will hopefully begin processing the data in the next week or so. The tools I will be using to do my research are Matlab, Antelope, Unix, and GMT.</summary>

    <summary>So my first week has generally consisted of a lot of head scratching hair pulling as I try to teach myself Unix and R. The tutorials are helpful but oh so tedious to work through. Other than tutorials I've been reading tons of literature related to my project in order to gain some much need background knowledge on fault tremor. My mentor is super helpful and my office is deathly quiet.. it's a little scary. I'm excited to get started on my project &amp;nbsp;next week, I think that will be a lot more interesting than tutorials.&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>The main structure of this week was to familiarize myself with CERI, obtain a University username, and establish a CERI account for the computer labs. &amp;nbsp;I was just able to accomplish the final task of obtaining my CERI account and was given a quick tutorial on how the Macs work. I spent most of this week studying what will be accomplished during my project and some of the methods of doing so. &amp;nbsp;While I am still struggling with how a lot of processing works, I better understand the basics of seismic processing and what the information in a seismogram gives me. &amp;nbsp;I also was able to better familiarize myself with Matlab and SAC. &amp;nbsp;I met with Dr. Langston today, and we outlined the structure for my project into four sections. &amp;nbsp;1) correlate to get the source-receiver waveforms through cross-correlation and auto-correlation. &amp;nbsp;2) Dispersion measurements to find group and phase velocity. &amp;nbsp;3) Construct Tomography of the Norther ME. &amp;nbsp;4) Use Structural Inversion to get a map of the shear velocities at varying depths. &amp;nbsp;Knowing these tangible goals, I am much more confident in my ability to perform each of them. &amp;nbsp;I also was able to take a look what the programing will look like and what style of data I will be dealing with. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The first goal of correlating and organizing the data from all of the stations should take roughly a month, but could be longer since a huge part of my project is locating the reflectors from autocorrelation. &amp;nbsp;Dr. Langston discussed July 7th as being a rough goal for accomplishing this first part. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <title>The Anisotropy Rhapsody - Ivan Kurz</title>

    <id>
     http://www.iris.edu/hq/internship/rss/interns/the_anisotropy_rhapsody
    </id> 
    <summary>I suppose I should verify the understanding of anisotropy I gleaned over the first week for you ladies and gentlemen. The basics: often, we idealize a fluid as isotropic, meaning that it has the same properties in all directions. It follows that within each broad category of seismic wave, p-waves and s-waves (compressional, longitudinal waves which have amplitudes along a stress, and shear, transverse waves which have amplitudes orthogonal to a stress), waves travel at the same speed no matter their directions. However, many earth materials, such as olivine, don't exhibit this. They have orientations which propagate waves faster or slower due to the "stiffness" along their directions, computed by the bulk and shear moduli. For an analogy, imagine how fast a taut Slinkie carries a compression verses a loose one, how quickly a tense rope carries a disturbance, or how the speed of sound is greater in brass than air. Often, the spacing in the medium's structure is lesser in the fast directions and greater in the slow directions. (Generally, waves travel faster under greater pressure, but that's a finer point I won't elaborate upon here for the sake of simplicity.) The equations say so, and you can't lie using Greek letters. (Believe me, I've tried.) What are some geological processes that can cause anisotrophy? In the crust, metamorphic foliation is sometimes at fault--when stresses cause materials in a rock to line up along a direction, so the rock doesn't have equant properties in that direction. In addition, microcracks in sedimentary rocks slow waves attempting to cross this spacing. In the upper mantle, where the mineral olivine is prevalent, the molecular structure of olivine facilitates the transmission of stress similarly. How do we measure it seismically? When an s-wave enters an anisotropic medium, it splits into two perpendicular polarizations dependent on the medium's anisotropy. One polarization, "stiffer" than the other, races ahead. You can then note the polarizations of incoming s-waves and their spacings in time to estimate the anisotropic orientation(s) and thickness of the medium. Hence, we specifically examine the properties of incoming s-waves. That should do the subject justice for now. I'll return to preparation for a brief presentation later today.</summary>

    <summary>There are currently two goals on my mind for the summer, and I will be posting many more along the way. A short term goal I have is to have all the research gathered and ready to go by the second week (6/13). Once all the research has been done and all the datasets are stored, I can then start analyzing the data to see if there is any correlation between hydraulic fracturing and earthquakes. A long term goal I have right now is to start a rough draft of my poster in early August. My abstract will hopefully have been submitted to AGU by this time. Also, a notebook will come in handy to help organize all of my research, and to ensure I am reaching my goals throughout the summer.</summary>

    <summary>6/5/14 The first week of my project is almost complete. So far I have been researching past articles on induced seismicity, as well as loading datasets into MATLAB for later analysis. This week is focused a lot on data organization for each of the injection/fracking wells that will be studied. It is important to keep all articles, datasets, location, dates, etc. with the same wells, so down the road it won’t be a hassle trying to re-organize everything later. So far we have nine wells that we will analyze in the coming weeks. So far so good!</summary>

    <summary>Yes, the world cup is about to be in full swing, and while many goals will be scored in Brazil I have my own goals to score this summer... 1. Enhance my ability to navigate and use MATLAB and more specifically tlPicker. I will be picking a lot of PmP arrivals (estimated 30,000+). The faster I get at recognizing PmP arrivals and quicker at filtering the seismic refraction records the faster I will be able to get the bulk of my work done. 2. Enhancing my knowledge of the subject matter. I have a collection of six starting papers that will give me more insight into the lower crustal low velocity region and ocean ridges. I want to be able to enhance my reading comprehension of the area I&amp;rsquo;m studying, and be able to ask the BIG questions when I invert my data. (ie. map out the lower crustal thickness and lower velocity zones). 3. Conservatively, watch at least 90% of the World Cup. I have a dual-monitor setup and simply must take advantage of it. No seriously, a healthy work-life balance is important. 4. Gain Independence and Interdependence in a research environment. I want to develop the skills and knowledge to be able to work on my own for extended periods of time, but also not be afraid to ask questions to my mentor. I want to actually contribute ideas along side my work, not just information. 5. Experience Seattle. People have told me that this is the best time of the year to be living in Seattle.</summary>

    <summary>I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a blogger, but here goes nothing. I am winding down after my first week of my internship at New Mexico Tech. It&amp;rsquo;s going well so far, except for the heat. Right now Socorro is experiencing a heat wave, just the other day it was 104 degrees. I am definitely not used to this kind of heat! The place I am staying at is really nice and only a short walk from campus, which is very convenient (plus they just turned on the AC!). My goals for the first third of this internship is to learn more about my research site (the Mexican subduction zone) and the earthquake events that occur there. I also want to learn how to use data catalogs and to develop a list of earthquake events. With that said list, I need to use GMT to map the events. Then I will download and organize my data. For the second third of my internship, I will learn and begin data processing for the Oaxaca events from the data I would have downloaded during the first third of my internship. During the last third of my internship, I will hopefully begin making plots and interpret the results. I will also be working on my abstract for AGU as well during this time and start my initial draft of my poster. A couple overall goals that I hope to get out of this internship experience are becoming more comfortable and confident with computer programming and learn how to use GMT. I also want to get to know the graduate students better and to not be too nervous to ask questions about what I have to do for my project or about graduate school. Hopefully I stay on track with this schedule and the master schedule my advisor wrote up for me. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a very busy summer, but I will learn so much and meet a lot of great people in the meantime. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

The house that I am staying at for the first week of my internship is very pleasant and conveniently close to campus. My first night there I met two Bulgarians, Vera and Alexander, who introduced me to a very tasty Bulgarian soup, so what beats that?? At USC I have my very own desk amongst the graduate student cubicles, so I am feeling pretty official. Everyone in the department has been very nice and welcoming, which has made the transition a lot easier. My work so far has consisted of reading articles in order to familiarize myself with the study region and with current theories concerning the geologic processes going on over there under our feet.&amp;nbsp; My goals for this internship go as follows: During the first third of my internship I want to get comfortable with the basic concepts behinds receiver functions, inversion theory, and common conversion point stacking. I do not think that I will be writing scripts this summer, but rather I will be using ones that Rob has already written. With that said, I want to learn general scripting conventions so that I can understand what Rob's scripts are doing on a fundmental level. After learning about the scripts I want to USE them and start doing data collection and processing. I want to make a skeleton of my poster for AGU and start thinking about the abstart that I will submit. Last but not least, I want to meet as many people as I can inside and outside of the department so that I can make some connections and (fingers crossed!) make some new friends.&amp;nbsp; During the second third of my internship I want to complete data processing and start anaylzing the resulting models. Having done some analysis, I hope to get my abstract a little more finalized. I also hope that I will have gotten to the beach by now!&amp;nbsp; During the final third of my internship I want to submit my abstrat to AGU and begin filling in my poster. Hopefully at this point I will know enough about what I am doing to start drafting a paper of my findings, eek!&amp;nbsp; Well, that is all that I have for now... Cheers!&amp;nbsp; Carolyn</summary>

    <title>[1] “Hello, World!” - Ivan Kurz</title>

    <summary>A typical introduction to any programming language will start with one of the more basic functions: printing a simple phrase. Ubiquitously, this phrase is "hello, world!" Whether in C++, FORTRAN, or Python, this hardly ever fails. I figure that there's no better way&amp;nbsp; to begin this blog. How come? For starters, my project--originally titled "Melt migration and distribution at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and its implications for seismic observations," but altered to "Models of seismic anisotropy around the San Andreas Fault, California" after discussion with my adviser, Dr. Mousumi Roy--involves plenty of coding, and for good reason. My overarching plan for this project is, via Python coding, FEniCS software for partial differential equation solutions, and D-Rex calculations of seismic anisotropy, to construct various models of lithospheric and asthenospheric rheologies in the San Andreas Fault region and their effects on anisotropic orientations of dry olivine-enstatite aggregates in the upper mantle.&amp;nbsp; We observe a stark contrast between northern California and southern California: in northern California, east-west anisotropy dominates far from the transform boundary, and fault-parallel anisotropy dominates in its neighborhood. Meanwhile, in southern California, east-west anisotropy dominates to a greater extent; fault-parallel anisotropy lies only in the immediate vicinity of the fault. Tetreault, Roy, and Gaherty have previously suggested that the former is due to strong lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling, and the latter, weak coupling. They drew their conclusions from variations of viscosities of two layers, emulating the higher-viscosity lithosphere and lower-viscosity asthenosphere, over different time frames. In particular, two-layered viscosity emulates northern data, and isoviscosity emulates southern data. I'm here to verify these observations! Much of this is new to me, and fairly technical. Faced with the task of eating a whole elephant, I'll adopt the strategy incorporated many times before: taking the whole elephant bit by bit, not all at once, in stafes I can measure. IRIS's suggestion of taking the summer in thirds sounds feasible enough. So, here goes: -The first third (about 1 June to 27 June): install all required software (Gedit, D-Rex, etc.) on my computer; learn Python and FEniCS from tutorials and code written by previous students under Dr. Roy; author my own code to reproduce growth time of a disturbance as a function of wave number for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, shown in 6-12 of Turcotte and Schubert's Geodynamics; attend the PyLith workshop at Stanford University from 23 to 27 June. -The second third (about 28 June to 19 July): complete the first step of the modeling process, accounting for strike-slip plate motion and asthenospheric flow, in both a two-layered scenario with differing lithospheric and asthenospheric viscosities and an isoviscous scenario. -The third2 (about 20 July to 15 August): apply D-Rex's calculations of seismic anistropic orientation to my models; submit my abstract for AGU (due 6 August); describe the implications of my models in full. Hopefully, I'll be able to progress past the material I'll attempt to verify and embark into more advanced territory by imposing new constraints on my models. In the meantime, I'm jumping through various hoops in the UNM bureaucracy so I may gain access to the physics building and internet in the first place. If I vanish, then I've been defeated. Stay tuned, folks.</summary>

    <title>Week One - Celeste Labedz</title>

    <summary>It&amp;rsquo;s been somewhat of a slow start for me at MIT. My professor was out of town on Monday and Tuesday, and the two postdocs with whom I&amp;rsquo;ll also be working on this project are both away at a conference until next week, so I was at first left alone with papers to read and computer tutorials to watch. They were interesting papers and useful tutorials, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be glad when I have a full panel of people to whom I can ask questions. There are actually very few people around right now on my floor of the Green Building, the building where the Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Science department is located, so it's a lot quiet and a little creepy. &amp;nbsp; Assignment #1: What I would like to accomplish this summer 1. Be able to communicate with other professionals - I want to be able to understand the geoscience jargon well enough that I can adequately express what I am trying to accomplish to professors, grad students, postdocs, and more, as well as to be able to adequately understand what their research is about when they tell me. This skill is particularly vital in making connections with other researchers and other institutions, which will be favorable to me as I begin to explore options for graduate school. This is something on which I can improve throughout the summer and throughout my future, but I will be able to keep track of my progress along the way by evaluating my interactions with my group, members of other groups around me, and other researchers at conferences like AGU. 2. Be able to communicate with anyone - I want to be able to explain my project simply and clearly enough that non-geoscientists can understand, too. I want to tell everyone about this project, from my physics professors to my middle-school-aged cousins, and I need to find the right words to do it. I have a good start at this one, as I am already experienced in explaining my job at a condensed matter physics lab at UNL to the people around me. My ability to explain my project will improve as I learn more about it myself throughout the summer, following one of my favorite quotes by Albert Einstein: &amp;ldquo;If you can&amp;rsquo;t explain it simply, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it well enough.&amp;rdquo; 3. Get the hang of MATLAB, Git, and more - I will be using computers in ways fairly new to me, and I would like to reduce my dependence on help from people and manuals as much as possible. I recognize how powerful these computer skills are, so I know it is in my best interest to have them on my side. I would like to be able to work more independently by one-third of the way through the summer, so that I will not be wasting the postdocs&amp;rsquo; time with continuous questioning. By the end of the second third of the summer, I want to reduce my dependence on online help, so that I can increase my own productivity. 4. Get the hang of reading the literature - The papers which I have started reading here are quite different from the condensed matter physics papers I read at the lab in which I work at UNL. It will take a lot time and effort, reading and re-reading, to understand the material in the papers and to learn the best ways to get the most out of them. By one-third of the way through the summer, I want to be able to explain the papers I already have, and be able to get the basic gist of any new papers I get after only a couple of read-throughs. 5. Ask at least one good question every day - I think this will be exceptionally helpful throughout the summer, and it is also just a good rule to live by. 6. Go to the New England Aquarium sometime - What can I say? I just really love aquariums. Seriously, though, work-life balance will be important this summer, because I want to get a lot accomplished, but remain a happy, functioning human being while doing so. Some of my ideas for fun include getting a library card and reading sci-fi, listening to the Boston Pops play on Independence Day, seeing if some of my friends that go to college in the area are around to hang out, taking in some of the local history, and more. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>There are so many things I would love to accomplish over the course of this summer, so I thought writing my goals down here will hold me to them.&amp;nbsp; Although I worked in a lab last summer, I have never been a part of a formal internship program like this where I'm starting completely fresh and forced to learn new concepts and techniques from the ground up.&amp;nbsp; To be honest, it's intimidating, and a lot of the time I really do feel like a clueless intern.&amp;nbsp; So, instead of overwhelming myself trying to learn everything all at once (like I'm prone to doing), I figured I'd split the summer into thirds and set goals for each one: 1.&amp;nbsp; Since I've been out of school for almost a month now, I'm in the third week of my internship not counting the orientation week in New Mexico, which is just about 1/3 through my time here (10 weeks total).&amp;nbsp; I'm taking the month of July off to travel to Namibia and Angola with my lab group from home, collecting samples for paleomagnetic analysis, which will become my senior thesis.&amp;nbsp; This presents me with a huge challenge, though.&amp;nbsp; My time here in North Carolina is limited, and, although I'm coming straight back to Chapel Hill afterwards, I need to make sure I have a firm grasp early on of what I'm doing before I leave for a month.&amp;nbsp; That is why my goal for the first part of the summer is to bite the bullet and learn how to program.&amp;nbsp; Now, I know I'm setting myself up for failure if I expect to learn an entire language in a month, because programming is something that sure as hell doesn't come naturally to me.&amp;nbsp; I am terrified of programming.&amp;nbsp; I don't know what it is--maybe I'm still traumatized from the intro Java class I took my freshman year which was filled with budding Mark Zuckerbergs.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I've built it up in my head that I absolutely cannot program.&amp;nbsp; But I want to prove myself wrong.&amp;nbsp; I'm going to face my fear, put in as much time as it takes for me to understand what's going on, and actually learn how to code.&amp;nbsp; I know it will be frustrating and I will feel like an idiot as I try to figure things out, but I really need to show myself that I am capable of doing this.&amp;nbsp; By the end of the first month of my internship, I would like to have a working code of some sort. 2.&amp;nbsp; In the second third of the summer, I want to complete and submit my abstract for AGU.&amp;nbsp; I know the deadline isn't until the last week of July, but I would like to have it done before I leave in order to make sure I don't accidently miss the deadline because of some silly internet connection problem.&amp;nbsp; This is my main goal during the middle weeks of my internship, because writing the abstract should also give me a better feel for how to go about putting together my poster.&amp;nbsp; This also pushes me toward an overall goal I have for the summer, which is to become more comfortable with writing professionally.&amp;nbsp; I'd like to be able to communicate knowledgeably about my research and put forth a scholarly discussion of what I've been working so hard on this summer.&amp;nbsp; I know that I need to get better at writing concisely, and I will push myself to ask for help and get feedback on my writing so that putting together scientific descriptions becomes more natural for me. 3.&amp;nbsp; When I come back in August for the last three weeks at UNC, I want to be focused on bringing my project together so I can be sure I have meaningful results to present at AGU.&amp;nbsp; One thing I have always struggled with as a student is confidence in myself and my work.&amp;nbsp; I don't want to be afraid to ask questions if I don't understand something, and I'd like to have enough assurance to put forth my own opinions and actually contribute to the scientific discussion.&amp;nbsp; So, that's exactly what I hope to do with my last weeks here.&amp;nbsp; I want to finalize my code in order to discuss my project in front of my lab group and get their opinions on how I could make it better.&amp;nbsp; This will require me to become comfortable with defending my work, which I'm hoping will provide me with confidence going into my senior year. Coming into my internship, I was met with a steep learning curve, so I know it will take plenty of time and effort to accomplish these goals this summer.&amp;nbsp; But hey, I'm always up for a challenge.</summary>

    <summary>There are a few key things I would like to accomplish before the end of my internship. Within the first third, I would like to learn to identify earthquakes in a seismogram, become familiar with Antelope and Unix, and read as many papers about the North Texas seismic studies as possible to familiarize myself with the topic. Within the second third, I would like to be able to independently conduct myself in the lab, perform waveform cross-correlation, and begin forming ideas to write in my abstract. Within the final third, I would like to improve event locations, compare locations and rates with faults, write my results into an abstract, and create relevant figures for my poster. Overall, my desire is to stimulate progress of my project by being a productive researcher and learn about both seismology and research in general.</summary>

    <summary>Although the trees had just barely started to bud in Connecticut, summer was in full swing in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, which came as quite a surprise when I showed up in early May.&amp;nbsp; Danny, the grad student I'm working with this summer, picked me up from the airport to take me to my new place, but it turns out I'm living in a forest (literally) and it took us a few tries to find the house.&amp;nbsp; It's a really nice place, despite the fact it's buried in trees--it's got that whole rustic, "secluded in the woods" vibe going on.&amp;nbsp; I'm living with four guys, two of which are UNC Law students who live in the house year-round, and two who are undergrads also doing internships for the summer.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, it's great living with guys because they never hog the bathroom.&amp;nbsp; However, I can tell they hate it when I claim the remote and turn on HGTV. I came to Chapel Hill absolutely exhausted right after finals period ended, which was a pretty quick and stressful turn around.&amp;nbsp; The day after I arrived I went on a run, got terribly lost (turns out most backroads are just people's driveways...), and didn't make it home until 2 hours later, sunburnt and thirsty.&amp;nbsp; So my first impression of North Carolina was shaped by the suffocating humidity and relentless hills that made my workout a bit more painful than expected.&amp;nbsp; But, I gave myself the weekend to explore the area and get settled before starting work in the lab, which led me to discover how beautiful Chapel Hill is.&amp;nbsp; I had no idea a campus could be so full of trees but still be considered urban.&amp;nbsp; It's weird because I'm used to going to school smack-dab in the middle of a big city, and UNC is very spread out, calm, and quiet.&amp;nbsp; I showed up completely burned out from a long semester, but after a weekend of sleeping, strolling around the city, and binge-watching The Mindy Project, I was ready to roll with my internship at UNC. My house is about a mile from the building I work in, so it's a nice walk every morning and late afternoon.&amp;nbsp; The first few days (actually, pretty much the whole first 2 weeks) were a whirlwind.&amp;nbsp; I met my adviser, was introduced to my project, was introduced to other projects going on in the lab, was told to write my first code in R, was presented with four years worth of data in the form of squiggly lines, and was presented with the challenge of learning an entirely new operating system in order to start working on all of the above.&amp;nbsp; In short, I was completely lost, smiling and nodding my way through the beginning.&amp;nbsp; Although information was being thrown at me left and right, I didn't feel as overwhelmed as I thought I would.&amp;nbsp; Actually, I felt excited about stepping into an entirely new field, learning new skills and concepts, and having the chance to work with a new group of people.&amp;nbsp; I expected to be given a list of tasks to complete, or papers to read, but instead my adviser gave me an overview of what I'll be working on and left me to decide how I want to approach the project.&amp;nbsp; I have the freedom to solve problems any way I want, which is a huge amount of independence I've never had before.&amp;nbsp; Although I work in a lab back home, this is the first time I feel like the project is truly my own, which excites me and helps to make a 10-hour day in the lab fly by. After the first two weeks at UNC, I flew out to New Mexico for the IRIS orientation, where I met an inspiring group of people from around the country.&amp;nbsp; I cannot express how much of a relief it was to be able to commiserate about not knowing how to program with people who are in the same position.&amp;nbsp; We spent a lot of time outside, hiking until my feet were blistered, installing seismometers, and performing an active source experiment.&amp;nbsp; There were also classes and lectures which provided exposure to various topics in geophysics, along with tutorials in MATLAB, GMT, and SAC--three computer programs often used in seismology research.&amp;nbsp; My favorite part, though, was having the opportunity to meet so many people from a multitude of backgrounds and careers.&amp;nbsp; Almost every activity throughout the week was led by someone different, who shared with us how he/she got to where they are today.&amp;nbsp; There was also a career panel at the end of the week where we could listen to advice and ask away about what it's like to work as a geophysicist in academia, industry, and government.&amp;nbsp; I walked away from the week with a broadened perspective of what possibilities lie ahead for me as I head into my senior year at Yale.&amp;nbsp; I also had the chance to think about what I want to get out of the IRIS internship this summer, both as a student and as a person.&amp;nbsp; In my next post I'll talk more about the goals I've laid out for the summer, get into the specifics of what I'm actually working on, and detail what I hope to accomplish by the time August rolls around. I'm sure there will be a steep learning curve and lots of new experiences throughout the summer, and hopefully I can capture the ups and downs on this blog to share with everyone.&amp;nbsp; Even though my hair has become a permanent frizzball in this weather, I am so excited to be somewhere new for the summer, and I feel lucky to join such an enthusiastic, driven team here at UNC.</summary>
