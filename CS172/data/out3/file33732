     <title>Oral Communications in Academia Series - Session 6: Nonverbal Communication</title> 
     <link>http://events.ucf.edu/event/88836/oral-communications-in-academia-series-session-6-nonverbal-communication/ 
     <description>
      “She doesn’t want to be here.” “He can’t stand teaching.” “She loves her subject.” These are all examples of what we potentially communicate to our students without saying a word. Sometimes what we say with body language is as important as what we say verbally. We will learn about the eight types of nonverbal communication. Acquire the skills to convey the meaning you intend without saying a word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To register for this workshop, please go to &lt;a href="http://ucf.qualtrics.com//SE/?SID=SV_4IY2Teu7UifFTLv" target=""&gt;http://ucf.qualtrics.com//SE/?SID=SV_4IY2Teu7UifFTLv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

     <title>Al-Anon: Serenity Now</title> 
     <link>http://events.ucf.edu/event/91714/al-anon-serenity-now/ 
     <description>
      This meeting is held every Monday (unless otherwise noted on the UCF calendar) from 7pm to 8pm on the UCF Main Campus inside the COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES building.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Al-Anon Family Groups are a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength and hope in order to solve their common problems. We believe alcoholism is a family illness, and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help friends and families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families and friends of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic. Whether the alcoholic is still drinking or not, Al-Anon offers hope and recovery to all people affected by the alcoholism of a loved one or friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information about this meeting visit &lt;a href="http://www.hs.ucf.edu/crc" target=""&gt;www.hs.ucf.edu/crc&lt;/a&gt; or call the Al-Anon Family Groups Helpline at (800) 344-2666.&lt;br&gt;

     <description>
      Come check out the Tech Common's FREE beginner Adobe Illustrator series of workshops. Open to students, faculty, and staff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Illustrator is an ideal program for printmaking, which means you need to know how to use type! Students will learn how to add effects to type, create 3D type, type along paths (like circles), and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please bring your own computer with Illustrator CS4 or higher installed.&nbsp;Bringing an external mouse to use is highly recommended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 30-day trial of full Illustrator CC can be downloaded from&nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads" target=""&gt;www.adobe.com/downloads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the Technology Commons on Facebook to keep up to date with news events.&nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/UCFTechCommons" target=""&gt;www.facebook.com/UCFTechCommons&lt;/a&gt;
