       <hr> <p class="ApplPrivacy_Heading"><a id="d"></a>Section D. Public Access to Information</p> <p class="ApplPrivacy_BodyText">In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are provided by both state and federal laws.</p> <p class="ApplPrivacy_BodyText">All of the information collected at this site becomes public records that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, unless an exemption in law exists. <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56.070"> RCW 42.17. 260(1)</a> states that:</p> 
       <blockquote> 
        <p class="ApplPrivacy_BodyText">Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section [RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing.</p>

Nondisclosure of Certain Personal Information</p> <p class="ApplPrivacy_BodyText">The Web Admissions Center may require you to provide certain personal information in order to apply for admission at the community and technical colleges in Washington State. The information is required in order to complete the admissions process. You may choose not to provide this information; but if you choose not to provide it, we will be unable to process your application for admission, and you will have to apply for admission either in person or by mail.</p> <p class="ApplPrivacy_BodyText">The following laws and regulations may prevent the college to which you are seeking admission from disclosing the personal information about you except for the purposes of admission. Only admissions information can be released without a student's authorization. Students must sign a release in order to have any other information disclosed or to withhold all information. Education information may be released to other institutions that have requested the records and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll. Information may be released to a third party without a student's consent if an emergency situation exists or if information is requested officially by means of a subpoena, court order, or legal report. Additionally, Congress requires student information to be released to military recruiters if officially requested. Admissions information may include student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, major fields of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student, and other similar information.</p>
