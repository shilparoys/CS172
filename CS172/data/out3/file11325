      <h2>dual-degree program (b.a./m.d.) in medicine</h2> 
      <h3>What is the seven-year Dual-Degree Program in Medicine?</h3> 
      <p class="subhead">A formal articulation agreement between the College of Liberal Arts of Drew University and the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) makes it possible for prospective first-year students to apply directly to a special, seven-year dual-degree program in medicine. Students are admitted simultaneously to both Drew and New Jersey Medical School. They then spend three years of study at Drew and four years at NJMS, completing both the B.A. and M.D. degrees in seven years.</p> 
      <h4>Can I be pre-med at Drew without participating in this seven-year B.A./M.D. program?</h4> 
      <p>Yes! Any student admitted to Drew can pursue a career in medicine and spend their full four years at Drew before continuing to medical school, taking time to explore other fields, take advanced science course work or gain research experiences.</p> 
      <h4>What is the difference between the accelerated B.A./M.D. program and regular pre-med studies at Drew?</h4> 
      <p>With the B.A./M.D. program, students are accepted simultaneously to Drew University’s B.A. program and Rutgers New Jersey Medical School (NJMS)’s M.D. program. These students spend three years at Drew and four years at NJMS. They do not need to apply again for medical school admission, although they must maintain high grades to stay in the program. With regular pre-med studies, a student devotes the normal four years to undergraduate work at Drew. Admission to medical school is not guaranteed, but students apply to medical schools of their choice at the end of their junior year, with help from Drew’s Health Professions Advising program.</p> 
      <h4>What credentials do I need to be accepted into the B.A./M.D. program?</h4> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Unweighted High School 3.8 GPA</li> 
       <li>SAT score of 1400 or higher (summing&nbsp;<b>only</b>&nbsp;critical reading and math scores) or ACT score of 32 or higher (must be on one administration of the exam)</li> 
       <li>SAT II subject test(s) in math or science (optional, but recommended)</li> 
       <li>Prior exposure to the medical field in the form of an internship, academic program, research, volunteer activities or shadowing (optional, but recommended)</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p><strong>Please note:</strong> You must be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States to be eligible for consideration for this program.</p> 
      <h4>How competitive is the program?</h4> 
      <p>Applicants to the dual-degree (B.A./M.D.) program should recognize that admission is highly competitive. Each year, 60 to 100 applicants to Drew University qualify for the program, only 5 to 10 of whom are offered admission by NJMS.</p> 
      <h4>Will ACT scores be accepted instead of SAT scores?</h4> 
      <p>Yes. An ACT score of 32 or higher, on one administration of the test, will be accepted instead of SAT scores.</p> 
      <h4>What if I am not selected for the dual-degree program? Can I still be admitted to the regular B.A. program?</h4> 
      <p>Yes! All dual-degree applicants are automatically considered for the B.A. program at Drew and may even receive an offer of admission to the B.A. program prior to learning about their final status in the B.A./M.D. application process.</p> 
      <h4>Will I be considered for Drew’s Merit Awards as a Dual-Degree Applicant?</h4> 
      <p>Yes. Merit awards can be used during three years of study at Drew. In addition BA/MD students students are encouraged, to apply to <a href="http://www.drew.edu/financialassistance/grants-scholarships/college">our specialty scholarships in science, civic engagement and the arts</a>.</p> 
      <h4>What are the academic requirements for students participating in the program?</h4> 
      <p>Participants in this program need not major in the sciences while at Drew, although fitting some majors into the three Drew years will necessitate taking extra courses. While at Drew, a dual-degree student completes the selected major, all general education requirements and a set of required pre-medical courses (two semesters each of biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry and physics; and six credits of English). To retain the guaranteed admission to New Jersey Medical School students must carry at least 14 credit hours each semester and maintain an overall grade-point average of 3.4 (on a 4.0 scale) each semester. In addition, students must maintain a grade-point average of 3.4 or better in all science classes taken each semester at Drew, with a minimum grade of B- in each of the required pre-medical courses. Finally, students must also take the MCAT exam during their junior year, although no minimum score is required on the test.</p> 
      <h4>How do I apply for the dual-degree program?</h4> 
      <p>Submit the regular Common Application and on the Drew University supplement indicate your interest in the B.A./M.D. program. Your application and supporting documents (transcripts, test scores, recommendations, etc.) must all be received by November 1.</p> 
      <h4>Is an admissions interview required?</h4> 
      <p>Yes. Once you complete your application by November 1, it will be reviewed by the Office of Admissions. Selected students will be invited for an interview.</p> 
      <h4>What is the timetable for admissions decisions?</h4> 
      <p>Drew University will forward the applications of qualified candidates to NJMS, where students will be selected for interviews at the medical school. In early April, NJMS will notify candidates of their admission to the program. Students admitted to the program must notify Drew of their decision to enroll by May 1.</p> 
      <h4>What if I am admitted to the program but later change my mind?</h4> 
      <p>If admitted to the dual-degree (B.A./M.D.) program, you are under no obligation to complete the program and attend NJMS. You may opt to remain at Drew and graduate after the regular four years of study and to apply to any other medical school you wish or pursue another career. However, you will not retain your guaranteed admission to NJMS as an option if you elect to submit applications to other medical schools.</p>
