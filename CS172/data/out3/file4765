     <h5><strong> December 2014 </strong><br> </h5> 
     <p>Christmas Greetings, Westmont Alumni!</p> 
     <p><strong></strong>As I write, “The weather outside is frightful.” But instead of singing, “Let it snow,” we’re singing, “Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain!” We’re thankful for this much-needed drink of water for our dry land here in Santa Barbara—and it adds to the feeling of Christmas!</p> 
     <p><span style="text-align:start;"><img src="images/TeriBradfordRouse_7.14.jpg" width="150" height="225" alt="Teri Bradford"></span>We’ve had an active month since the last newsletter. We celebrated Homecoming in October, and alumni brought a joyful, vibrant spirit to campus as old friends reunited. We also helped host a wonderful event at Old Skool Café in San Francisco and welcomed local alumni and their families to Kerrwood Lawn for the traditional Pickle Tree Lighting and Santa photos. </p> 
     <p>This year, I’m co-chairing a committee for the college’s strategic plan that seeks to make progress in “Providing Lifelong Connection and Transformational Value” for students and alumni. I’m passionate about this important task. We’re focusing on two things: implementing a six-year strategy (the college years plus the year before and after college) to cultivate students’ vision for calling and vocation; and implementing the approach and structures for connecting, networking and developing professionally. I have the privilege of co-chairing this committee with Dr. Edee Schulze, our new vice president for student life and dean of students. We have a lot to do—and great folks to work with. </p> 
     <p>As we head into Christmas, I pray that God’s spirit of peace and joy will be present in your life and the details of your days.</p> 
     <p> Blessings,<br> <br> Teri Bradford Rouse<br> Senior Director of Alumni and Parent Relations</p>

     <h5><strong>Homecoming Past and Future </strong></h5> 
     <p> <img src="images/homecoming_001.jpg" alt="President Beebe during parade" width="135" height="135">We enjoyed a wonderful celebration on campus Oct. 17-19. Westmont welcomed more than 600 alumni (and many kids, too!) for a weekend filled with fun, great conversation, reminiscences and glimpses of Westmont today. From the welcome barbecue and the first annual golf cart parade to the all-alumni brunch honoring four alumni on the beautiful magnolia lawn to the fun-filled family carnival, young alumni tailgate, soccer games and the well-attended class reunions, folks experienced a meaningful and celebratory time.</p> 
     <p class="txt_dont_wrap"><img src="images/50sphoto.jpg" width="235" height="156" alt="homecoming"> <strong>...</strong> I especially appreciated watching alums from the 1950s who couldn’t get enough of each other! Throughout the weekend, we witnessed the long-term, ongoing impact of Westmont in the lives of our alumni.<br> <br> <strong>Mark your calendar now for Homecoming 2015, Oct 2-4! </strong></p> 
     <h5><strong>AAA: Alumni Authors Abound&nbsp;</strong></h5> 
     <p><strong>Each edition of 955 focuses on a few alumni authors</strong>. If you know alumni authors or have written something yourself, please email me and let me know. In the meantime, enjoy reading about Michael Yankoski, Paul Angone and Margot Starbuck. </p> 
     <h6><a name="yankoski" id="yankoski"></a></h6> 
     <h6>Michael Yankoski '05: <strong>"The Sacred Year: Mapping the Soulscape of Spiritual Practice"</strong></h6> 
     <p><img src="images/MichaelYankoski_000.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Yankoski">Frustrated and disillusioned with his life as an itinerate motivational speaker, Michael Yankoski was determined to stop merely talking about his faith and start living it. The result was a year of focused engagement with spiritual practices—both ancient and modern—that fundamentally reshaped and revived his life. By contemplating apples for an hour before tasting them (attentiveness), eating on just $2 a day (simplicity), or writing letters of thanks (gratitude), Michael discovered a whole new vitality and depth through the intentional life.<br> <br> </p> 
     <p><strong><img src="images/MichaelYankoskiBook_000.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Yankoski Book">... </strong>Guided by the voice of Father Solomon, a local monk, Yankoski’s sacred year slowly transforms his life. Both entertaining and profound, his story will resonate with those who wish to deepen their own committed faith as well as those who are searching— perhaps for the first time—for their own authentic encounter with the Divine.</p> 
     <p>Michael Yankoski ’05 is a writer, aspiring theologian and urban homesteader who dreams of becoming a competent woodworker, musician and sailor. He received his master’s in theological studies at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, is a (novitiate) Oblate of St. Benediict, and has written four books. Michael grew up in Colorado, feels at home on the Pacific Coast, and resides in Indiana, where he and his wife, Danae ’06, are pursuing doctorates at the University of Notre Dame. For more information about Michael and his recent book, see <a href="http://www.michaelyankoski.com/">www.MichaelYankoski.com</a>, <a href="http://www.TheSacredYear.com">www.TheSacredYear.com</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF-A0LK-OMA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF-A0LK-OMA</a></p> 
     <h6>Paul Angone '05: <strong>"101 Secrets for Your Twenties" </strong></h6> 
     <p><img src="images/PaulAngoneandBook.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="paul angone">Every twenty-something needs a little black book of secrets. Our twenties are filled with confusion, terrible jobs, anticipation, disappointment, cubicles, break-ups, transition, quarter-life crisis, loneliness, post-college<em>what the heck</em>, moderate success sandwiched in between complete failure, and we need a worn, weathered guide stashed somewhere close by to help shed some light on this defining decade.<em>101 Secrets for Your Twenties</em> is that book.</p> 
     <p><strong>From the reader:</strong> “Like advice from a wiser, funnier, older brother . . . Paul’s been there, done that, and wants to save you some pain and some trouble.” -Seth Godin, <em>New York Times</em>bestseller and author of<em>The Icarus Deception</em></p> 
     <h6><a name="starbuck" id="starbuck"></a></h6> 
     <h6>Margot Starbuck '91: <strong>"Not Who I Imagined" </strong></h6> 
     <p><img src="images/MargotStarbuck_001.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="margot">When Margot Starbuck ’91 attended Westmont chapel as a student, she felt drawn to the gospel of unearned grace so joyfully articulated by guest speaker Brennan Manning and reinforced by Chaplain Bart Tarman. So when Margot noticed that a lot of Christians still struggle to believe that God receives us as we are and not as we should be, she wanted to share a similar message of transforming grace. In <em>Not Who I Imagined</em>, Margot invites readers to discard the masks they’ve given to God (disappointment, judgment and absence) and to glimpse the face that smiles upon them, receiving each exactly as they are. </p> 
     <p> </p> 
     <p><strong><img src="images/MargotStarbuckBook_000.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="margot book">... </strong>One reader shares, “<em>Not Who I Imagined</em> is changing my life!I am accepted as I am<em>now</em>. Nothingcan change His love for me…I have only just tapped the surface of the ice around my heart, but it's cracked, and it feels great! This is not just a book: it’s a transformation that I need. I can’t wait to finish, and I know it will be read more than once!</p>

     <p> <img src="images/alumni.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="alumni">We’re always encouraged when we hear that you want to be involved with Westmont in some way in your home town, on campus or by meeting with a student or fellow alum. Your desire to give back inspires us to do even better work. </p> 
     <p>In the next few months, we’ll take a deeper look into our chapter program and determine what changes to make and how best to meet the needs of our alumni across the country. Ideally, in alumni-rich areas we’d like to see a core group willing to work together to provide opportunities for connecting, with support from the alumni office. If you have ideas or would like to be included in the conversation, I’d love to hear from you. Stay tuned for more information in the coming months. </p>

     <h5><strong>Grace, Gratitude and Goodness: A Devotion from Campus Pastor Ben Patterson</strong></h5> 
     <p><strong><img src="images/BenPatterson.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="BP"></strong>Throughout the past semester, we’ve emphasized the goodness of gratitude in chapel. Let me summarize briefly what we’ve been saying to our students—and also encourage you. First, here is the main text, followed by a word on why gratitude is so good. <strong> </strong></p> 
     <p>Be joyful always; pray continually; give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus…. May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it. 1 Thessalonians 5:14-18, 23-24</p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
     <p><strong>... </strong>Paul gave three short commands to be joyful always, pray continually and give thanks in all circumstances. William Law spoke from the heart of these when he wrote, </p> 
     <p>“Would you know who is the greatest saint in the world? It is not he who prays most or fasts most, it is not he who gives most alms or is most eminent for temperance, chastity or justice; but it is he who is always thankful to God, who wills everything that God wills, who receives everything as an instance of God’s goodness and has a heart always ready to praise God for it…. Could you therefore work miracles, you could not do more for yourself than by this thankful spirit, for it . . . turns all that it touches into happiness.”</p> 
     <p>These are extravagant—but true—claims. Why is continual thanksgiving so important to spiritual health? Because it comes from an attitude toward God that is so healthy: God is perfect in love, wisdom and power. He always wills what is best, always knows what is best and is powerful enough to always effect what is best. Continual thanksgiving practices this life-giving perspective. It says, “Father, even though I can’t see your love, wisdom and power in these circumstances, I believe you are bigger than what I can see. I will praise you that you are God and you are good in every circumstance of my life.”</p> 
     <p>Thanksgiving is a spiritual discipline. So thank God for all you see (which usually isn’t very much!). Then, when you run out of things to thank him for, thank him for what you cannot see (which is infinitely greater than what you can see!).</p> 
     <p>Thanksgiving should be indiscriminate; if it is, it will lead to indefatigable joy. As Law says, it “turns all it touches into happiness.” Nothing can stop our God! He will sanctify us through and through, no matter what. He will present us blameless at his coming, no matter what. He is faithful, and he will do it (5:23-24)—no matter what. So thank him, no matter what.</p> 
     <p>Have a Merry Christmas as you thank God for his indescribable gift (2 Corinthians 9:15).</p> 
     <p>Prayer: Father, even though I can’t see your love, wisdom and power in these circumstances, I believe you are bigger than what I can see. I will praise you that you are God and you are good in every circumstance of my life.</p> 
     <h5><strong>More Meditations on Gratitude </strong></h5> 
     <p><img src="images/reflections.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="reflections">Westmont has a new Quick Link on our home page for <a href="http://dallaswillardcenter.com/devotionals/">Daily Meditations</a>that you can enjoy. Our Dallas Willard Center developed these devotionals for the Westmont community.</p> 
     <p>In addition to video meditations on the Lord’s Prayer, the site currently includes <a href="http://dallaswillardcenter.com/gratitude-devotionals/">10 Meditations on Gratitude</a><a href="http://dallaswillardcenter.com/gratitude-devotionals/"></a>. Each video includes five components:</p> 
     <ul> 
      <li>Opening Prayer (or Opening Reflection or Call to Worship)</li> 
      <li>Meditating on Scripture (including Breathing the Passage)</li> 
      <li>Giving Thanks</li> 
      <li>Concluding Prayer (or Concluding Reflection)</li> 
      <li>Taking It With You</li> 
     </ul> 
     <p>During this season of giving thanks, we hope and pray that these meditations on gratitude help to “Nourish Our Life with God in All Sectors of the Community,” one of the cross-cutting priorities on our strategic map.</p>
