  <p>Electric cars may be the future of driving, but first, the vehicles need to spark excitement among the general public. That’s why Penn students have been working hard for the past two years to build one of the world’s first electric racecars.</p> 
  <p>“Our goal is to revolutionize electric vehicles,” says Tommy Sutton, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics in the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) and a member of Penn Electric Racing. “We want to show the public that these cars, in addition to being highly efficient, can also be extremely high-performing.”</p>
