       <p>If you are interested in an RN to BSN program, begin your search for funding here with our searchable directory of RN to BSN scholarships. Start with the renewability function, especially if you have multiple years left in your traditional or online RN to BSN program, as these scholarships can pay for your education year after year as long as you continue to meet the requirements and keep your grades solid. Continue by searching for scholarships sponsored by specific schools or states in order to find the best place to study for your BSN degree. If you are already in a program, search by enrollment level to make sure your program level qualifies you for the scholarships you find. Likewise, search based on minimum GPA, as many RN to BSN scholarships online require you to have a strong academic record. Finally, you can search based on ethnicity to find scholarships available to students from ethnic backgrounds like yours.</p> 
       <p>You can continue your search for scholarships even after using the directory. You can find more scholarships by searching for RN to BSN scholarships online or contacting the financial aid office at your school. You can also contact your employer if you are already working as an RN, as they are often willing to sponsor your continuing education.</p>

        <h2>Identify Trends in RN to BSN Scholarships</h2> 
        <p>Most scholarships available for RN to BSN students are also available to students in other nursing programs, such as standard RN programs and MSN programs, and are available regardless of what area of nursing they wish to specialize in. As a result, these scholarships are often competitive. They also often have fairly high GPA requirements, with almost 25% requiring students to carry at least a 3.0 GPA to be eligible. You will need to apply yourself in your RN to BSN program and get solid grades if you want to receive funding for your degree.</p> 
        <p>A number of organizations offer nursing scholarships. Some scholarships are offered by universities that feature nursing programs, whereas others are provided for specific specializations by professional associations. Some are also offered by private groups or community foundations, which serve people who want to go into a particular area of nursing study or who are from a certain city or county. These diverse opportunities mean that regardless of where you are from or which area of the field you would like to study as part of your RN to BSN degree, you can find scholarship opportunities.</p>
