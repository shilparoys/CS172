             The student conduct code shall apply to student conduct that occurs on college premises, to conduct that occurs at or in connection with college sponsored activities, or to off-campus conduct that, in the judgment of the college, adversely affects the college community or the pursuit of its objectives. Jurisdiction extends to, but is not limited to, locations in which students are engaged in official college activities including, but not limited to, foreign or domestic travel, activities funded by the associated students, athletic events, training internships, cooperative and distance education, online education, practicums, supervised work experiences or any other college-sanctioned social or club activities. Students are responsible for their conduct from the time of application for admission through the actual receipt of a degree, even though conduct may occur before classes begin or after classes end, as well as during the academic year and during periods between terms of actual enrollment. These standards shall apply to a student's conduct even if the student withdraws from college while a disciplinary matter is pending. Inappropriate conduct by students who have completed classes and are awaiting graduation ceremony are covered by this student conduct code.

             (1) College disciplinary proceedings may be instituted against a student charged with conduct that potentially violates both the criminal law and this student code (that is, if both possible violations result from the same factual situation) without regard to the pendency of civil or criminal litigation in court or criminal arrest and prosecution. Proceedings under this student code may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings off campus at the discretion of the vice-president of student affairs or designee. Determinations made or sanctions imposed under this student code shall not be subject to change because criminal charges arising out of the same facts giving rise to violation of college rules were dismissed, reduced, or resolved in favor of, or against the criminal law defendant.

             (2) When a student is charged by federal, state, or local authorities with a violation of law, the college will not request or agree to special consideration for that individual because of his or her status as a student. If the alleged offense is also being processed under the student code, the college may advise off-campus authorities of the existence of the student code and of how such matters are typically handled within the college community. The college will attempt to cooperate with law enforcement and other agencies in the enforcement of criminal law on campus and in the conditions imposed by criminal courts for the rehabilitation of student violators (provided that the conditions do not conflict with campus rules or sanctions). Individual students and other members of the college community, acting in their personal capacities, remain free to interact with governmental representatives as they deem appropriate.
