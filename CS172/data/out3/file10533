        <h2 xmlns="">Financial Aid</h2> 
        <h3>Academic Progress Policy</h3> 
        <p></p>
        <p class="dropcap">Students at Green River Community College are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress in order to receive financial aid. This policy defines what is meant by satisfactory academic progress. The college will look at all attempted credits regardless of the source of tuition payment. The Financial Aid Office is not allowed to recognize grade forgiveness. <strong>Should you have questions about this policy and how it pertains to you, please contact the Financial Aid Office.</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>Gr</strong>een River’s policy consists of three basic requirements, which are:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li><strong>QUALITY</strong>&nbsp;- Students must maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 each quarter. Students are also required to have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 at the end of the second academic year (six quarters) and thereafter regardless of enrollment level. Certificate programs must maintain a cumulative 2.0 GPA consistent with the requirements for graduation.</li> 
         <li><strong>QUANTITY</strong>&nbsp;- Students must successfully complete the highest number of credits attempted each quarter based upon the chart below. Attempted credits are counted even when they do not show on the grade transcript.</li> 
         <li sizcache="5" sizset="0"><strong>TIME FRAME&nbsp;</strong>- Students will have time limits for completing their programs of study. Students can be considered for financial aid for the equivalent of 150% of a program's length which includes all attempted college level credits. "Program" includes all pre-requisites, any changes in degrees or certificates and transfer credits that apply toward the program at Green River. This time frame usually means 9 full-time quarters of attendance (100 level classes and above). Students enrolled in programs with more than 90 credits will be allowed additional quarters as long as it is the first attempted program on the transcript. The time frame will be expanded for students enrolling part-time. To remain on pace to complete the program within the 150% time frame, students must complete a minimum of 67% of the credits attempted each quarter.<br><br> <p>&nbsp;If attending three-quarter time (9-11 credits), students can receive financial aid for 12 quarters of attendance. If attending half-time (6-8 credits), students can receive financial aid for 18 quarters of attendance. If choosing to attend less than half-time (5 credits or less), students can receive financial aid for up to the equivalent total of the first 9 full-time quarters of attendance.</p> <p>Students are asked to submit official transcripts for evaluation of transfer credits. These transfer credits will count toward the overall financial aid eligibility and time frame.</p> </li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>Financial Aid only covers classes which count toward the eligible program of study at Green River. Certificates with fewer than 24 credits will not be covered. Students wanting to drop classes should do so prior to the start of the quarter as dropping classes will affect eligibility, and students may owe an overpayment of grant funds.</p> 
        <p>The following chart shows the number of credits needed to maintain good academic standing each quarter.</p> 
        <table sizcache="5" sizset="0" border="0" align="center">

        </table> 
        <p>The following information details how warning and termination will affect your financial aid eligibility.</p> 
        <p><strong>Good Academic Standing </strong>(2.0 GPA or higher) and completion of credit level:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li> 
          <div sizcache="5" sizset="0">
           &nbsp;Students must continue to complete attempted credits and maintain a 2.0 quarterly GPA to receive aid. If struggling, contact your academic advisor or the Financial Aid Office to find out how we can assist you.
          </div> </li> 
        </ul> 
        <p><strong>Warning Status </strong>(GPA = 1.5 to 1.99) and/or reduction in completed credit level:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>Students on warning status are eligible to receive aid for the following quarter.</li> 
         <li>Students are placed on warning status for not completing their attempted credits (as noted on the chart) and/or having a quarterly GPA between 1.5 and 1.99.</li> 
         <li>Students are allowed only two warnings, so a third quarter of warning will make students ineligible for aid.</li> 
         <li>The two warnings cannot be back-to-back. Back-to-back warnings will result in termination of eligibility.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p><strong>Termination/Suspension Status </strong>(GPA = 0.0 to 1.49): Students are NOT eligible to receive grants, loans or work-study funds.</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>Termination status can occur after the first quarter of attendance. Warning status does not necessarily occur before termination as the quarterly GPA and credits completed determine the academic standing.</li> 
         <li>If students have had two quarters of warning status, they will lose financial aid eligibility the next time classes are dropped or the quarterly GPA falls below 2.0. The two warning quarters cannot be back-to-back.</li> 
         <li>If students completely withdraw either officially or unofficially after the fifth day of the quarter and complete “0” credits, they will lose eligibility for financial aid. Students receiving any financial aid during the first five days of the quarter will also lose eligibility if completing zero credits. Repayment of all or part of the grant funds (used for tuition and fees or disbursed to the student) may also be required if students did not earn the aid received. Aid is earned based on the number of days of class attendance. If the college is required to return tuition funds to federal accounts in excess of the state tuition refund policy, students will be billed for the additional refund. There is no penalty for withdrawal prior to the fifth day of the quarter if no financial aid has been used.</li> 
         <li>If students fail to complete the required credits indicated on the chart, the quarterly GPA drops below 1.5, or the cumulative GPA is less than 2.0 at the end of the second academic year (six quarters), students will lose eligibility for aid.</li> 
         <li>If students do not complete their programs of study within the allowed time frame, their eligibility for aid will expire.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p><strong>Appealing Loss of Financial Aid Eligibility</strong></p> 
        <p>Failure to maintain good academic standing may be the result of circumstances beyond the students’ control. In cases of students’ illness, injury, a death in the family or unusual circumstance, students may appeal to continue their financial aid by filing an Academic Progress Petition to request reinstatement of financial aid. <a target="_blank" title="Academic Progress Petition" href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/academic-progress-petition.pdf">The appeal form</a> (Petition) is available online or in the Financial Aid Office. Students must show they are able to complete their programs with a minimum 2.0 GPA in the allowed time frame in order for the appeal (Petition) to be approved. If reinstated, they may be asked to develop an educational plan which may include enrolling part-time or taking developmental course work. After an appeal has been approved, students will be placed on probation status, and they must restore their good academic standing within one quarter. Students may NOT file another appeal (Petition) for a second quarter in a row.</p> 
        <p>The appeal process should be started as soon as grades post and/or be completed prior to the 9th day of the following quarter if planning to remain enrolled. Appeals should be completed during the first week of the quarter or sooner for summer quarter.</p> 
        <p><strong><strong>Reinstatement of Financial Aid</strong></strong></p> 
        <p>If students have not maintained satisfactory academic progress, they are not eligible and are not entitled to financial aid. Students are required to pay their own tuition. Students will be required to do one of the following for one quarter to reinstate their financial aid:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>If enrolled the prior quarter for 12 or more credits, they must enroll, pay for, and successfully complete 6 or more credits with a 2.0 GPA or higher in the next quarter. The cumulative GPA must be 2.0 at the end of the second academic year (six quarters) regardless of enrollment level.If enrolled the prior quarter for 11 credits or less, you must enroll, pay for, and successfully complete 5 or more credits with a 2.0 GPA or higher in the next quarter.</li> 
         <li>If enrolled the prior quarter for 11 credits or less, students must enroll, pay for, and successfully complete 5 or more credits with a 2.0 GPA or higher in the next quarter. The cumulative GPA must be 2.0 at the end of the second academic year (six quarters) regardless of enrollment level.</li> 
         <li>In addition, students must show that they can successfully complete their programs of study within the allowed financial aid time frame.</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>Please notify the Financial Aid Office when you believe you have satisfied the requirements so that we can review your eligibility.</p> 
        <p><strong><strong>Additional Information about the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy</strong></strong></p> 
        <ul>
         <ol> 
          <li>Students may receive financial aid to take up to 45 credits of developmental coursework (courses below 100 level).</li> 
          <li>Financial aid will pay for students to repeat a class once. Financial aid will also pay to retake a class with an “I” (incomplete) grade if re-registered in the class.</li> 
          <li>Grades of 0.0 – 0.9, I, N, W, NC, or Y do not count toward completed credits.</li> 
          <li>Adult Based Education (ABE), G.E.D. Preparation, English for Speakers of Other Languages, Continuing and Community &nbsp;Education, some High School completion classes, and Parenting classes are not eligible for financial aid and do not count toward attempted credits for the period of enrollment. Apprenticeships do not qualify for financial aid.</li> 
          <li>If financial aid applications are completed late in the year, students may be paid retroactively for the quarters already completed during the current academic year, as long as they were considered in good academic standing for the prior quarter(s) and at the time the financial aid eligibility is determined.</li> 
          <li>Students must be working toward an eligible degree or certificate program to receive financial aid, and all classes must apply toward the degree or certificate program at Green River.</li> 
          <li>If transferring to Green River, students will be considered to be making satisfactory academic progress at the time of transfer. Credits transferring into programs of study will be counted toward the nine-quarter maximum eligibility time frame.</li> 
          <li>If students have documented disabilities, they can be allowed reasonable accommodations to make up credits and improve grades. These decisions will be based on individual circumstances and determined by the Financial Aid office.</li>
