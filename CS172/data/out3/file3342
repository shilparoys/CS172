     <h5 align="center"><strong>Parents Support Net - September 2014</strong></h5> 
     <p style="text-align:left !important;">Dear Parents,</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;">Whether you are a parent with a returning or a new student, I want to welcome you to the fall 2014 semester!</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;">While students were away during the summer, we remained busy. In a more relaxed environment, we had the time to make progress on various projects, organize the coming year’s activities and anticipate the return of our impressive students. The campus always feels a bit strange without them, so we are excited that they are back!</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;"><img src="images/TeriBradfordRouse_7.14_000.jpg" width="130" height="195" alt="Teri Bradford Rouse">Our Parent Relations team is ready to serve you throughout the year. We not only love our students, but we love our parents. Our commitment to you is solid, and we desire to equip you with all that is needed to navigate the college years along with your student. We want you to feel a part of the Westmont family and encourage you to participate in the events provided throughout the year.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;">When you’re on campus anytime during the year, be sure to introduce yourselves to me or my wonderful team (Lorinda, Sergio and Beth) in the Alumni and Parent Relations Office. Of course, we love to talk with you as well, so feel free to pick up the phone and call us.</p> Blessings on you as you prepare for Westmont 2014!

     <p style="text-align:start;">As students begin the new academic year, you may wish to include their class verse in your prayers for them.</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;"><img src="images/seal.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Seal">Class of 2015: “…I will be joyful in God my Savior. The sovereign Lord is my strength.” (Habakkuk 3:18-19)</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;">Class of 2016: “Seek me and live.” (Amos 5:4)</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;">Class of 2017: “…no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love Him.” (1 Corinthians 2:9)</p> 
     <p style="text-align:start;">Class of 2018: “He has made everything beautiful in its time.” (Ecclesiastes 3:11)</p>

     <p><strong>Diverse Class of 2018 Arrives at Westmont </strong></p> 
     <p> <img src="images/westmont-class-group.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Class of 2018">There are 445 new students (379 first-years and 66 transfers) who arrived on campus and moved into their residence halls on Thursday, Aug. 28, for Orientation. Do you wonder where they’re from? The new students represent -- seven countries and 29 U.S. states. There are eight international students and nine missionary/Third Culture students, representing Argentina, China, Germany, Jordan, New Zealand, Philippians, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and Sweden. Fourteen percent come from Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. </p> 
     <p> <strong>...</strong> In addition, thirty-four percent are students of color with 8% identifying themselves as multi-racial with two or more races. Forty percent aremales &amp; 60% females.&nbsp;The top 5 majors are Economics &amp; Business (14%),Kinesiology(12%), Psychology (9%),Biology (6%) &amp;English (5%). Eight percent indicated interest in Pre-Med/Pre-Dent Track and 12% have yet to declare a possible major. </p> 
     <p>Our Dean of Admission, Silvio Vasquez says this about the new students,"It is always difficult to single out one thing that most impresses me about the classes of new students. For the transfer student, they are the strongest academically in recent history and geographically diverse as well. The entire class of new first year andtransferstudents are very diverse ingeneral, not just ethnically diverse, but socio-economically diverse. This reinforces the hard work of the College overall to make a Westmont education affordable and attainable." </p> 
     <p>For an even broader perspective of college students today, some claim these young adults are post "Millennial" and are now part of a new generation known as Generation Z. These emerging adults have never known a world without technology and they are often referred to as "digital natives". They tend to be well networked socially through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Terrorism and the environment have continually been top news items and some say these youth have been over-parented and over-protected.This generation of kids will think differently, they will have different expectations about what is possible, and will view the world through a truly different lens.They are certainly from a different generation than many of us! </p>

     <p> <img src="images/student-working.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Student Job">Students may gain their first work experience through a job on campus at Westmont. Hiring student employees is mutually beneficial to staff and students and something we love to do! Students interested in working on campus while at Westmont need important, ORIGINAL documents to verify their identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. According to federal law, employers in the U.S. must use Form I-9 for employment verification. If your student is unsure which documents to use, see the <strong><em>List of Acceptable Documents</em></strong> found on page 9 of the current&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-9.pdf">Form I-9</a>.

     <p><strong>Did You Know? </strong></p> 
     <p> <img src="images/beebe_000.jpg" width="135" height="135" alt="Beebe">Did you know President Gayle D. Beebe has a blog? You can <a href="http://blogs.westmont.edu/president/">follow him</a> and learn about a variety of important things. He wrote a number of entries during his visit to the Rome in June. Why was he there? He explains in one of his posts: </p> 
     <p><strong>... </strong>“I’m visiting Rome as part of a small contingent of non-Catholic Christians invited by Pope Francis to consider whether or not we can find common ground to advance the life and ministry of Jesus. I’m representing Christian higher education in North America. The members of our group come from all walks of life and all trajectories of the Christian faith, invited to build on Paul’s admonition that we find unity in the spirit as the Body of Christ.”</p> 
     <p>We hope you are interested in reading more about him and the topics he considers important for him and Westmont. If you are a parent of a first-year student, you might enjoy his posts from last fall about <a href="http://blogs.westmont.edu/president/category/first-year-students/">meeting with new students</a>. </p>
