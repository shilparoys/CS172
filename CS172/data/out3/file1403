      <p><strong>Jennifer Tanner</strong> holds a B.A. in Mathematics from Eastern College and a B.S. in Civil Engineering Oklahoma State University. Her M.S. is from the University of Costa Rica (1998) and her Ph.D. in Structural Engineering is from The University of Texas at Austin (2003). She has worked in consulting in the areas of forensic engineering at Atkinson Noland and Associates and has inspected pavements for the City of Tulsa. </p> 
      <p>Dr. Tanner’s primary research goal is to solve current structural engineering problems by closing gaps in existing design knowledge. Her research focuses on experimental testing and implementing results into design guides or code documents. Some noteworthy areas of research are (i) durability of concrete and masonry, (ii) non-destructive testing, ASR evaluation, (iii) shear wall testing, and (iv) an autoclaved aerated concrete. Experimental research projects are designed such that each specimen to produces a desired failure mode to answer a particular structural engineering question. She is a voting member of the masonry design code and commentary (TMS 402), serves as chair of ACI 526, Autoclaved Aerated Concrete, and is co-chair of ACI 440L, Durability of Fiber Reinforced Polymers.</p>
