       <h2><strong>Educational Administration</strong></h2> 
       <h4><strong>The Program</strong></h4> 
       <p>The Educational Administration program simultaneously serves the formal academic leadership development needs of persons aspiring to become K-12 leaders and leaders in adult education or post-secondary education institutions. The program responds to school boards, community college boards of trustees and state education agencies for close coordination and collaboration between K-12 and adult and post-secondary education. Thus, the programs prepare managers and leaders for K-12 education, post-secondary education and adult education. In the K-12 education setting, these managers and leaders include public and private school principals (including those at the assistant and associate level), district office personnel and district superintendents. In the post-secondary education and adult education settings, these managers and leaders include coordinators, directors, deans and executive leaders at community colleges and adult education organizations.</p> 
       <p><br>The program encompasses two graduate cognates: <br>Adult and Post-Secondary Education<br>K-12 Education Leadership</p> 
       <h4>Adult and Post-Secondary Education</h4> 
       <p>This option offers the following graduate degrees in education: master of arts (M.A.), doctor of education (Ed.D.), and Philosophy of Education (Ph.D.). The master's program requires 33 credit hours beyond the bachelor's degree and is available online. The Ed.D. is the terminal professional degree in education designed for students who desire to improve their professional practice as educators. The Ed.D. requires a minimum of 77 semester hours beyond the bachelor's degree. A bachelor's and master's degree is required of all students to be admitted to an Ed.D. program. Candidates may, with the approval of the faculty, transfer up to 30 semester hours from previous course work. </p> 
       <p>The domain or field of adult education is vast and varied, extending from self-directed learning (educational activities initiated and largely conducted by the individual himself or herself) to more formal educational opportunities sponsored by institutions and agencies (such as adult basic education, community colleges, university and local education centers). Within the adult education graduate program at UW, this focus is generally narrowed to educational endeavors sponsored by institutions and agencies and specifically designed for adult participants. Areas of study include the following: </p> 
       <ol> 
        <li>adult development and learning theories; </li> 
        <li>leadership development in post secondary education institutions</li> 
        <li>the social, historical, and international context of adult education; </li> 
        <li>equity and access to continuing education opportunities for adults&nbsp; </li> 
       </ol> 
       <p>Graduate study in adult education addresses the challenges faced by institutions and agencies in the design and delivery of post secondary education and the preparation of educators to meet these challenges. </p> 
       <p><strong>Career Options</strong></p> 
       <p>Graduates of the program are employed specifically as faculty and administrators in community colleges and universities, human resource developers, adult literacy educators, military training specialists, training coordinators for government and social service agencies (such as the Department of Family Services, the Department of Labor, Family Planning Agencies, and the Eppson Center for Seniors), museum educators, adult learning consultants, and continuing professional educators in many fields including law, religion, nursing, and PK-12 teaching. </p>
