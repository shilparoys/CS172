        <p><b>I-BEST Overview</b></p> 
        <p>Washington State’s Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training (I-BEST) began as a pilot program at 10 community and technical colleges and has since been implemented in all 34 colleges in the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) system. 
         <!--The program was developed 
						in response to studies performed by the Washington State 
						Board for Community and Technical Colleges SBCTC that indicated 
						that students were unlikely to complete a long-term basic 
						skills class and then successfully transition to college 
						level vocational programs. The I-BEST model challenges the 
						traditional notion that students must first complete adult 
						basic education or ESL before moving to college level course 
						work. The I-BEST model pairs ESL or ABE instructors with 
						vocational or content area instructors to co-teach college 
						level vocational courses -

						careers. If you would like to see your I-BEST materials

            <p><b>Program Summary</b>: This project supports ESL/ABE students through an ECE program. The participants work with young children as employees at cooperative and private nursery schools, Head Start Centers, Early Childhood Education Assistance Programs and in programs for children with special needs. This project develops a pathway for students in need of basic skills support through the entire Associate in Applied Science Degree in Early Childhood Education and prepares students for entry-level positions in child care facilities as part of a career pathway in education. Fifty-three of the 90 credits within this AAS degree in Early Childhood Education are IBEST-eligible. This pathway includes multiple stop out and re-entry points with increased levels of employment at each stop out point. A full-time student can complete the degree in two years. The first12 credits count toward a CDA and could be achieved in two quarters of part-time enrollment. This program is designed for adults currently working in childcare settings and participating in part-time education and training.</p>

            <p>Program Summary: The Child Development Associate Preparation with ESOL course content focuses on child growth and development with emphasis on planning a safe, healthy, and supportive learning environment for young children and families as outlined by The Child Development Associates (CDA) National Credentialing Program. These functional areas are integrated with English literacy improvement. In addition, the national CDA credential requires that a student complete 480 hours of worksite placement experience. For students who are not yet employed in a child care facility, GRCC facilitates a placement and the advisor works closely with the student to implement the skills that they are learning in their course of study. Some students may choose to register for practicum credit simultaneously, and these credits apply directly to both the ECE certificate of proficiency and the ECE AAA degree.</p>

            <p><b>Program Summary</b>: This IBEST project supports ESL/ABE students through an Early Childhood Education program. The participants work with young children as employees at day care centers, cooperative and private nursery schools, Head Start Centers, and in educational programs for young children with special needs. At the present time, 45 of the 97 credits within the AAAS in Early Childhood Education are eligible for I-BEST support. The program prepares students for entry-level positions in child care facilities as part of a long-term professional pathway in education. This pathway allows for several start-stop and reentry points giving participants increased levels of employment at each stop out point. The first 12 credits count toward a Child Development Associate (CDA).</p>
