        <h3>Student Employment</h3> 
        <p></p>     
        <p class="dropcap">In a community college setting, having a part-time job while attending classes is an integral part of the academic success that students achieve. Many opportunities for employment are available at Green River Community College, from institutional funding through federal and state funding. When you envision your part-time job as resumé building skill, your individual success and contribution to our college community will be invaluable.</p> 
        <p>If you are currently attending or plan to attend Green River Community College, and you have or will have Federal, State, or Work Grant Work Study funding, please sign up for a work study orientation session through the link below.</p>

          <h3>Student Guide</h3> 
          <p>     </p>
          <p>If you want to work on campus, you must have a “funding source” or an account from which to be paid. There are three funding sources available to you. Please read each award explanation and determine which path applies to your eligibility or interests.</p> 
          <div class="accordion"> 
           <h3>Federal Work Study Award</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Work-study is part of your financial aid award. &nbsp;</p> 
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/student-affairs/financial-aid.htm">See financial aid information</a></p> 
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can take your award and apply for any open position on campus that proves to be a good fit for both you and a supervisor.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Work Grant Award</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The financial aid director allocates each division an annual award of student program funds to be used to hire students to assist faculty/staff in that particular division. The division chair knows the yearly allotment and awards students throughout the year at the request of his/her faculty/staff. You do not have to be financial aid eligible to be awarded Work Grant funds, only skill eligible. Work Grant funds will be awarded at the discretion of the division chair only.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Institutional Work Study</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The financial aid director has a small pool of funds and can award a "position", not a particular student, to a division/department based on available funding, request and need. Institutional Work Study funds will be awarded at the discretion of the financial aid director only.</p> 
           </div> 
          </div>

          <h3>Supervisor Guide</h3> 
          <p>     </p>
          <p>Thousands of hours of work each year are performed by student employees. It would be safe to say that collectively, as well as individually, the campus community benefits greatly from these many hours of student work. In many cases, these students come to your divisions and departments with Federal Work Study money which means no cost to your office. In some cases your division and departments allocate small awards to students to help you keep the educational and business process flowing smoothly. We know you appreciate their work efforts, no matter where the funding comes from.</p> 
          <p>This handbook is a general guide to help in the hiring process for student employees. It contains information that will assist you in choosing students that are a good fit for your job request, as well as assist you to train and keep an excellent employee.</p> 
          <div class="accordion"> 
           <h3>Award Information</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you are interested in having a student employee assist you, the following information may be helpful.</p> 
            <p>In order for a student to work on campus, he/she must have a "funding source" or an account from which to be paid. There are three funding sources available to students:</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Federal work study award</span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Work grant award</span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Institutional work study award</span></li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>Please remember…no student is allowed to work UNTIL the hiring process has been completed through the student payroll office (LSC-231), no matter the funding source.</p> 
            <h4>Federal Work Study Award:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>This award is granted quarterly (based on financial eligibility) through the student's financial aid package. This award allows the student to apply for any open student position on campus. A list of available jobs is maintained by the student payroll coordinator (LSC-231).</p> 
             <p>If a student chooses to work for you with a work study award, they come to you with a funding source. You will know it is a work study award (and the award amount) when the student presents you a white "authorization to work card" generated and signed by the student payroll study coordinator.</p> 
             <p>(Students DO NOT receive this card until they have completed the hiring process). If you and the student agree the job is a fit for both of you, sign the authorization to work card as the supervisor and the student will return it to the student payroll coordinator. Federal work study students are hired on a first-come, first-served basis.</p> 
            </div> 
            <h4>Work Grant Award:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>The financial aid director gives each division an annual award of student program funds to hire students to assist faculty/staff in that particular division. The division chair knows the yearly allotment and awards students throughout the year at the request of faculty/staff.</p> 
             <p>Division chairs and/or building secretaries have the yellow work grant cards which are generated by the division chair. This card is signed by the division chair, student, and supervisor. The award amount is also determined by the division chair. Any student enrolled in 6 or more credits (12 or more for international students) qualifies for work grant money at the discretion of the division chair.</p> 
            </div> 
            <h4>Institutional Work Study:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>The financial aid director has a small pool of funds and can award a "position" to a division or department based on available funding, request and need. Division/department determines the student hired (6 or more credits/12 or more international students). The yellow work grant card will be generated by the financial aid director and signed by both student and supervisor.</p> 
            </div> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Supervisor Process</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The hiring process for student employees will be different at the onset of hire, depending on the money source.</p> 
            <p>If you want to hire a Federal Work Study Student:</p> 
            <p>Contact the Student Payroll Coordinator with a written request for a work study student. There are Summer Request forms and Fall/Winter/Spring Request forms. Complete the form(s) and return to the Student Payroll Coordinator, Mail Stop: FA by the deadline dates. These requests will be available to work study students looking for a position.</p> 
            <p>This process is also used if you need additional students the following quarter.</p> 
            <p>The hiring process itself for Federal Work Study employees is on a first-come, first-served basis. The hiring thrust for these student employees is the beginning of each quarter. Students will have the first 4 days of each quarter to interview with supervisors – exception – Summer quarter is a one day turn-around. Hiring day is the Friday following the first day of the quarter (for Summer quarter it is Tuesday). Remember students are not officially hired, nor can they begin working, until hiring day. During this process you may have signed a work card, expecting a student employee, but unfortunately on hiring day, the student was not hired. The student will be asked to contact you regarding employment status.</p> 
            <p>Students are asked to complete a one page job application, with job references that will assist you in determining whether the student has the skills/attitude you have in mind. Ask them for it, look at it, ask them about it!</p> 
            <p>The Federal Work Study Hiring Policy will give you more information regarding the hiring process.</p> 
            <h4>If you want to hire a Work Grant student:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>Talk with your division chair about a particular student you want to hire. The division chair will determine if funds are available and then generate the yellow work grant card. After the work grant card is complete, ask the student to bring it to the student payroll coordinator (LSC-231, extension 2447) to schedule a mandatory orientation prior to working.</p> 
            </div> 
            <h4>If you want to hire an Institutional Work Study student:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>Contact the financial aid director (LSC-240, extension 3326) to see if money is available to fund a ”position” in your area. The financial aid director will generate the yellow work grant card and send to you for supervisor and student signatures. After the card is complete, ask the student to bring it to the student payroll coordinator (LSC-231; extension 2447) to schedule a mandatory orientation prior to working.</p> 
            </div> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Student Process</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The student process for working on campus is different depending on eligibility, desire and skill level. As a supervisor, this information may be helpful as students are directed or choose to inquire about working for you.</p> 
            <h4>Federal Work Study employees:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>These students have completed the FAFSA (Free Application For Federal Student Aid) and the Green River Supplemental Financial Aid Application. This process takes three to four months to complete and the student is notified by the Financial Aid office (letter). The awards offered to students in this process are based on eligibility.</p> 
             <p>The student must sign and accept the work study award and schedule a mandatory orientation with the student payroll coordinator (LSC 231). When the student has completed the orientation and the federal employment papers, a white authorization to work card is issued with the pertinent information, including quarterly work study awards for supervisor information. The available jobs will be presented to the student. They will contact you for an interview. Federal work study students are hired on a first-come, first-served basis because of limited payroll slots. Reading the Federal Work Study Hiring Policy &nbsp;would be informative.</p> 
            </div> 
            <h4>Work Grant/Institutional Work Grant employees:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>Students who desire to work on campus, but are not eligible for the Federal Financial Aid package, are referred to the divisions and departments for work funding. Students will be encouraged to contact instructors and/or staff on campus for Work Grant/Institutional Work Grant employment.</p> 
             <p>The division chair or department head will determine whether the student is hired or not, depending on money available and skill level. Keep in mind, the student must be registered for 6 or more credits (international students 12 or more credits). To ensure federal, state and Green River guidelines are met for legal and liability issues, students are not allowed to work UNTIL the hiring process has been completed through the student payroll office (LSC-231).</p> 
            </div> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Hiring Guidelines</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Here are some “be sure…” statements to assist you in hiring the ideal student for your office.</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure the student is a good fit for your office regarding skills and availability to work. Check with previous supervisors both on and off campus. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure the student has completed orientation and the federal employment packet before putting the student to work if you are hiring a Work Grant/Institutional Work Grant employee. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure to ask the student if they are registered for 6 or more credits, 12 or more credits for International students, before you discuss a Work Grant/Institutional Work Grant position. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure the student understands exactly what the job entails, so there are no surprises after the student begins working. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure you are prepared to do some training and expect a learning curve. Remember you might be hiring someone who is not up to speed in the business world, after all, that is why students are here – to learn. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure to caution your student about doing homework on the job. It is not allowed and can be cause for dismissal. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Be sure to submit your student’s time sheet on time. They cannot do this. If you submit a time sheet late, the student must wait until the following pay period to receive a pay check. Many students are counting on that money for day care, food, and gas to get here. </span></li> 
            </ol>
           </div> 
           <h3>Time Sheet Process</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>In order to insure accuracy and limit liability, students must attend a payroll orientation session BEFORE they begin working. Student employees attending a payroll orientation session are provided complete, detailed and accurate time sheet information. As a supervisor signing for the accuracy of the time sheets, the following guidelines may be of interest to you.</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">The time sheet for your student employee will be delivered to you each pay period, unless (1)the student is out of funds; or (2) an error was made on the previous time sheet. Ask the student to see the student payroll coordinator for the time sheet (LSC 231, ex. 2447). Pay periods are normally two weeks. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Your student is instructed to give you their signed time sheet on the “DUE” date. When you sign as supervisor, you “...certify this employee worked these hours and dates. The work was completed satisfactorily…”. For auditing purposes to confirm hours worked, you must also record the number of hours in the small square just above the “Supervisor Signature” line. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Supervisors are responsible for putting signed, completed time sheets into the building time sheet box for pick up by the due date indicated. Ask the building secretary where the box is located. If you miss the pick up times, it is your responsibility to bring the time sheet to the student payroll coordinator’s desk for processing. (LSC-231). Late time sheets will be processed with the next payroll. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Students must complete time sheets in BLUE or BLACK ink only, and initial any changes. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">When recording time, do not round. Military or 24 hour clock time is not acceptable. </span></li> 
             <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Do not write over existing numbers. White out is permitted if correction is legible and initialed. </span></li>

           <h3>Performance Evaluation</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>As a teaching/learning institution, performance feedback is important in the success of our student employees. You may find the <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/evaluation-form.pdf" title="Student Performance Evaluation Form" target="_blank">Student Performance Evaluation form</a> to be helpful.&nbsp; Take a look at the areas chosen for evaluation. Discuss them with your student employee. An informal mid-quarter review is suggested. The form Performance Evaluation should be completed as the student leaves your employ permanently or at the end of the academic year. These forms are required on a yearly basis and become part of the student’s permanent record in the Financial Aid office. Forward this completed form to the student payroll coordinator located in LSC-231, extension 2447.</p> 
            <p>Ideally, when you discuss this evaluation with the student, they will sign the form also. They have an option to allow or not allow this information to be shared with future potential employers. Without this permission, the information will not be released.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Release of Information/Code of Responsibility</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>All student educational and financial records at Green River Community College are maintained according to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which means, by federal law, no information regarding student records is disclosed to any one person (including mothers, fathers, spouses, children, etc.) school, agency, business, etc, without the written consent of the student.</p> 
            <p>The Financial Aid office has a <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/autorization-to-release-confidential-information.pdf" title="Authorization to Release Confidential Information" target="_blank">Release of Information form</a>&nbsp; that students sign allowing their particular Financial Aid information to be released to certain persons, etc. On the flip side, all student employees are cautioned against releasing any kind of information concerning the identity and activity of anyone at this institution without written consent. Each student employee is asked to sign a <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/code-of-responsibility.pdf" title="Code of Responsibility" target="_blank">Code of Responsibility</a>, acknowledging he/she understands and supports the policy. Students also understand that signing the policy means he/she accepts the consequences of violating the policy.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Termination/Dismissal/Transfer Requests</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Termination: Unfortunately sometimes federal work study students are not as academically successful as they would like to be for several reasons. At the end of each quarter the financial aid office will determine which students are terminated from financial aid, based on the previous quarter’s performance. The student will receive a letter from financial aid informing them of the termination. If a student is terminated from financial aid, they are also terminated from their work study position. The student payroll coordinator will notify you before the quarter begins if your work study employee is affected by this regulation. Your employee may or may not return to work depending on whether they are reinstated or not. When reinstated, the student must immediately check with the student payroll coordinator to see where the hiring process is at the time. If payroll is closed, the student will not be able to continue to work.</p> 
            <p>Grade point issues do not affect division work grant or institutional work grant student employees, unless the supervisor sees it as an issue.</p> 
            <p>Dismissal: Student work ethics and performance as a work study or work grant student contribute to the success of your office environment. When responsibilities are ignored, job expectations should be enforced. The step started by you, the supervisor, will depend on the severity of the behavior. (Note - Not all supervisors will go by these exact steps. This is just an example of the possible consequences prior to dismissal).</p> 
            <dl>
             Step 1:
            </dl> 
            <p>Give your student employee a verbal warning indicating they have violated a standard of behavior or performance which is unacceptable.</p> 
            <dl>
             Step 2:
            </dl> 
            <p>If the behavior continues, give the student a written warning. This should be a signal that the behavior has not changed or improved and is serious enough to have written warning in their file.</p> 
            <dl>
             Step 3:
            </dl> 
            <p>At this point the student’s behavior will have been discussed twice and their job is at risk. The student will be informed that if the behavior continues, they will be asked to leave with no further discussion.</p> 
            <dl>
             Step 4:
            </dl> 
            <p>With the fourth occurrence the student will be terminated by you, the supervisor and the student payroll coordinator will be notified. The dismissal will be documented and become part of the student employee’s permanent file. If the student is a federal work study employee but wants to continue to earn his/her award, they must contact the student payroll coordinator for a meeting (LSC-231, extension 2447).</p> 
            <p>Transfer Requests: If a federal work study employee wants to transfer to another supervisor, they will have to see the student payroll coordinator. The student employee will be asked to continue in their present position until the end of the quarter, if possible. If that is not possible, they will be informed of any open positions on campus.</p>

            <p>When you receive the financial aid award letter in the mail and discover you have been awarded Federal Work Study, sign your letter immediately and return to the financial aid office.

           <h3>Release of Information/Code of Responsibility</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>All student educational and financial records are maintained according to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which means, by federal law, no information regarding your records is disclosed to any one person (including mothers, fathers, spouses, children), school, agency, business, etc. without your written permission.</p> 
            <p>The <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/autorization-to-release-confidential-information.pdf" title="Release of Information Form" target="_blank">Release of Information Form</a> used in the financial aid office is good for the length of time you are attending Green River Community College.

           <h3>Work Hours/Schedule/Wages</h3> 
           <div>

You must remain enrolled in at least 6 credits during the quarter. If you drop below 6 credits, you will automatically be terminated from your Work Study position. If you have the maximum Work Study award per quarter ($1500), you are allowed to work a maximum of 19 hours per week - less hours per week if you choose. If you have less than $1500 per quarter, here is how you determine the average number of hours to work each week to extend your award throughout the quarter.</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Quarter award amount $___________</li> 
             <li>Divide the quarter award amount by $9.47</li> 
             <li>Divide the answer by 11 weeks average per quarter</li> 
            </ol>

            <ol> 
             <li>Your supervisor has supervised work for you to do and notifies the student payroll coordinator of your request to work, and…</li> 
             <li>You are registered for 6 or more credits the following quarter.</li> 
             <li>Or…you can roll over the remaining balance to the following quarter. At the end of spring quarter all unearned work study money reverts back to the school account.</li> 
            </ol>
           </div> 
           <h3>Time Sheet Process</h3> 
           <div>

            <ol> 
             <li>attended orientation and completed your federal employment papers and…</li> 
             <li>found a job, completed your Work Card and submitted it to the student payroll coordinator</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>When your time sheet is printed, it will be delivered to your supervisor, who will give it to you.</p> 
            <p>If your supervisor does not receive your time sheet, there is a problem. Please see the student payroll coordinator (LSC 231).</p> 
            <p>Your time sheet will be audited against the <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/time-sheet-guidelines.pdf" title="Time Sheet Guidelines" target="_blank">Time Sheet Guidelines</a> discussed at orientation.</p> 
            <p>The time sheet will have the pay date you can expect to be paid for the time submitted. A check on that pay date is only guaranteed if your time sheet is submitted on the date it is due. Your supervisor is responsible to submit your time sheet for payment, you cannot submit it. Please check with your supervisor at your earliest meeting, following the due date, regarding the timely submission of your time sheet. If your time sheet is submitted to the student payroll coordinator late, you will not be paid until the following pay period.</p>

           <h3>Performance Evaluation</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The job you are performing here is a real job and as such you have the opportunity to learn and grow in skills and opportunity. Supervisors are strongly encouraged to conduct an informal mid-term review, concentrating on tasks performed well and improvement opportunities. This is a chance to realize you have added resume skills and also to set goals for future improvement. When you stop working, your supervisor will complete the <a href="Documents/student-services/financial-aid/evaluation-form.pdf" title="Student Performance Evalucation" target="_blank">Student Performance Evaluation</a>&nbsp;for you and it will be part of your permanent record. If you are available, the evaluation will be discussed with you and you can sign and date the form. If you desire, you will also have the opportunity to release this information to future employers who inquire about your work record.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Termination/Dismissal/Transfer Requests</h3> 
           <div> 
            <h4>Terminations:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>Unfortunately sometimes students are not as academically successful as they would like to be for various reasons. At the end of each quarter the financial aid office will determine which students are terminated from financial aid, based on the previous quarter’s performance. If it is determined that you are terminated from financial aid, you will receive a letter informing you of the termination. If you are terminated from financial aid, you are also terminated from your work study position. See the financial aid office immediately for options to reinstate your financial aid and Work Study award. When you have been reinstated, contact the student payroll coordinator (LSC 231, extension 2447) immediately to see if there are still positions open for you to continue your Work Study employment.</p> 
            </div> 
            <h4>Dismissal:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>Your work ethics and performance as a Work Study student contribute to the success of the office in which you work. When responsibilities are ignored, job expectations will be enforced. The step started by the supervisor will depend on the severity of the behavior. (Note - Not all supervisors will adopt these exact steps. This is just an example of the possible consequences prior to dismissal).</p> 
             <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Step 1:</h5> 
             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">You will receive a verbal warning indicating you have violated a standard of behavior or performance which is unacceptable.</p> 
             <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Step 2:</h5> 
             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">If the behavior continues, you will be given a written warning. This should be a signal that the behavior has not changed or improved and is serious enough to have written warning in your file.</p> 
             <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Step 3:</h5> 
             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">At this point your behavior will have been discussed twice and your job is at risk. You will be informed that if the behavior continues, you will be asked to leave with no further discussion.</p> 
             <h5 style="padding-left: 30px;">Step 4:</h5> 
             <p style="padding-left: 30px;">With the fourth occurrence you will be terminated by your supervisor and the student payroll coordinator will be notified. The dismissal will be documented and become part of your permanent file. If, at this point, you want to continue with your Work Study award, you must contact the student payroll coordinator for a meeting.</p> 
            </div> 
            <h4>Transfer Requests:</h4> 
            <div> 
             <p>If you want to transfer to another supervisor, see the student payroll coordinator. You will be asked to continue in your present position until the end of the quarter, if possible. If that is not possible, you will be informed of any open positions on campus.</p> 
            </div> 
           </div> 
          </div> 
          <h2>America Reads/Counts</h2> 
          <p>The America Reads/Counts Program is another way to earn your Federal Work Study award. This opportunity is only available to students who have received a Federal Work Study award through their Federal Financial Aid package. In 1996 the presidential administration proposed the America Reads Challenge to mobilize an army of reading tutors to address the fact that 40% of third grade children were not reading well enough to succeed academically. Math education faced the same crises so three years later the America Counts program was introduced and patterned after the successful America Reads Challenge program.</p> 
          <p>You have an opportunity to be part of this army of tutors mobilizing in the elementary and junior high schools for reading and/or math. This is a win/win situation for you, the school, and the students you tutor.</p> 
          <p>Tutoring young children is not for everyone. For this reason we do not send you into community schools to tutor without absolute commitment and understanding of your purpose, position, and responsibility.</p> 
          <p>Feedback from both the student and the selected school has been very positive. Through this program you will come to realize the tremendous positive influence you can have in the life of a young child. We hope you, too, will experience the feeling of success and accomplishment in participating in this tutoring program.</p> 
          <p>If you are interested in the America Reads/Counts program, notify the student payroll coordinator in LSC-231, extension 2447 to get started.</p> 
          <div class="accordion"> 
           <h3>Advantages</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>There are many advantages to participating in the America Reads/Counts program. You do NOT have to be enrolled in Education classes or want to be a teacher. However, if you are on the Project Teach track, this opportunity is even more of an advantage.</p> 
            <h4>Why Would I Tutor?</h4>

           <h3>Hiring Process</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you express an interest in participating in the America Reads/Counts (A.R.C) program, you will be asked to schedule an orientation session and complete the Federal Employment papers with the student payroll coordinator located in LSC-231, extension 2455. You will also be scheduled for a brief session to discuss A.R.C. responsibilities and guidelines.</p> 
            <p>The tutoring program can be set up at any elementary, middle, or junior high school. Choose a school and give that information to the student payroll coordinator and she will contact the school and make arrangements for you to be interviewed by the school’s designated contact.</p> 
            <p>You will be given an authorization to work card for officials at the school to sign. When that card is returned to the student payroll coordinator, you will be placed on the payroll system and receive a time sheet.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Release of Information Confidentiality</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>All student educational and financial records are maintained according to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which means, by federal law, no information regarding your records is disclosed to any one person (including mothers, fathers, spouses, children), school, agency, business, etc. without your written permission.</p> 
            <p>The <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/autorization-to-release-confidential-information.pdf" title="Release Form" target="_blank">Release of Information Form</a>&nbsp;used in the financial aid office is good for the length of time you are attending Green River Community College. It can be updated (added to or deleted from) any time you wish. After leaving Green River, in the event you apply for jobs off campus, be sure to update your Release Of Information with the student payroll coordinator, otherwise no information will be released regarding your employment at Green River Community College.</p> 
            <p>Now that you are confident that the financial aid office will not release any information concerning your activities here, as a student employee, you also fall under that same obligation. You will be asked to sign a <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/code-of-responsibility.pdf" title="Code of Responsibility Form" target="_blank">Code of Responsibility Form</a> that clearly defines your responsibility as a student employee to protect the identity and activity of anyone at this institution or the school at which you work. Refer all requests for information and/or progress status regarding your tutored students to the teacher for whom you work.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Work Hours/Schedule/Wages</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Your work hours and schedule will be determined by you and your supervisor at the school where you tutor, depending on how many hours you want to work and your class schedule. Keep in mind the travel time and distance. Be careful in planning your work hours so you do not have to make changes in your schedule. It is very difficult for the school to adjust when you do not show up for your tutoring appointment. If you have the maximum work study award per quarter ($1500) you are allowed to work up to 19 hours per week and no more - less hours per week, if you choose. You may be asked if you can “volunteer” additional time if you have reached your weekly maximum or earned your quarter award. Federal regulations prohibit you from volunteering in a position where you have been or will be paid. If you have less than $1500 per quarter, here is how you determine the average number of hours to work each week to extend your award throughout the quarter.</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Quarter award amount $___________</li> 
             <li>Divide the quarter award amount by $9.32</li> 
             <li>Divide the answer by 11 weeks average per quarter</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>You must remain enrolled in at least 6 credits during the quarter. If you drop below 6 credits you will automatically be terminated from your work study position.</p> 
            <p>All American Reads/Counts tutors are paid $9.32 per hour.</p> 
            <p>If you have money remaining on your award at the end of the quarter, you have the choice of working the break between quarters on the following conditions:</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Your supervisor has supervised work for you to do and notifies the student payroll coordinator of your request to work. and…</li> 
             <li>You are registered for 6 or more credits the following quarter.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>Sometimes when Green River is on quarter break, the city schools are in session and you can work more than the maximum 19 hours per week if approved by the student payroll coordinator in LSC 231.</p> 
            <p>Or…you can roll over the remaining balance to the following quarter. At the end of spring quarter; however, all unearned work study money reverts back into the account.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Time Sheet Process</h3> 
           <div>
            Time sheets are only issued when you have:
            <ol> 
             <li>attended orientation and completed your federal employment papers and the additional America Reads/Counts orientation session</li> 
             <li>met with the designated school contact, completed your work card and submitted it to the student payroll coordinator</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>When your time sheet is printed, you will be responsible to pick it up each pay period from the student payroll coordinator. For auditing purposes, return the completed time sheet in a sealed envelope.</p> 
            <p>Complete your time sheet according to the <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/time-sheet-guidelines.pdf" title="Time Sheet Guidelines" target="_blank">Time Sheet Guidelines</a> discussed at orientation.</p> 
            <p>You will notice the pay date for the time submitted on the time sheet. The pay date is only guaranteed if your time sheet is submitted on the date it is due. You are responsible to submit your time sheet for payment on the due date. If your time sheet is submitted to the student payroll coordinator late, you will not be paid until the following pay period.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Responsibilities and Expectations</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The tutoring job that you have is a REAL job! Once you have committed to a schedule, the teachers and students are expecting you to assist them in their educational success.

            <p>Your work hours and schedule will be determined by you and your supervisor, depending on your award amount, how many hours you want to work and your class schedule. You must be enrolled in 6 or more credits during the quarter, if at any time you drop below 6 credits you will be terminated from your work position. If you are an International Student, you must be registered for 12 or more credits, unless it is your vacation quarter or last quarter of education and in that event you must be enrolled in at least 6 credits to keep your student employee status. You cannot work over 16 hours per week. Your Work Grant/IWS award may be a small amount and your supervisor may request you spread your time over the entire quarter. Remember! When your award is earned, you will be terminated from payroll for the remainder of the quarter.</p> 
            <p>All student employees on campus are paid $9.47 per hour.</p> 
            <p>If you have money remaining on your award at the end of the quarter, you have the choice of working the break between quarters on the following conditions:</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Your supervisor has supervised work for you to do and notified the student payroll coordinator of your request to work, and…</li> 
             <li>You are registered for 6 or more credits the following quarter.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>Or…you can roll over the remaining balance to the following quarter. At the end of spring quarter all unearned money reverts back to the school account.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>TIME SHEET PROCESS</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Time sheets are only issued when you have:</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>attended orientation and completed your federal employment papers, and…</li> 
             <li>submitted your signed work card to the student payroll coordinator.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p>When your time sheet is printed, it will be delivered to your supervisor, who will give it to you.</p> 
            <p>If your supervisor does not receive your time sheet, there is a problem. Please see the student payroll coordinator (LSC 231)</p> 
            <p>Your time sheet will be audited against the <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/time-sheet-guidelines.pdf" title="Time Sheet Guidelines" target="_blank">Time Sheet Guidelines</a> discussed at orientation.</p> 
            <p>The time sheet will have the pay date you can expect to be paid for the time submitted. A check on that pay date is only guaranteed if your time sheet is submitted on the date it is due. Your supervisor is responsible to submit your time sheet for payment, you cannot submit it. Please check with your supervisor at your earliest meeting, following the due date, regarding the timely submission of your time sheet. If your time sheet is submitted to the student payroll coordinator late, you will not be paid until the following pay period.</p> 
           </div>

            </ul>

            <ul> 
             <li>Clear, concise information regarding job expectations</li> 
             <li>Explanation of expected behavior standards, as well as office protocol</li>

            </ul> 
           </div> 
           <h3>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>The job you are performing here is a real job and as such you have the opportunity to learn and grow in skills and opportunity. Supervisors are strongly encouraged to conduct an informal mid-term review, concentrating on tasks performed well and improvement opportunities. This is a chance to realize you have added resume skills and also to set goals for future improvement. When you stop working, your supervisor will complete the <a href="Documents/student-affairs/financial-aid/evaluation-form.pdf" title="Evaluation Form" target="_blank">Student Performance Evaluation form</a>&nbsp;for you and it will be part of your permanent record. If you are available, the evaluation will be discussed with you and you can sign and date the form. If you desire, you will also have the opportunity to release this information to future employers who inquire about your work record.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>DISMISSAL</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Your work ethics and performance as a Work grant/IWS student employee contribute to the success of the office in which you work. When responsibilities are ignored, job expectations will be enforced. The step started by the supervisor will depend on the severity of the behavior. (Note – Not all supervisors will go by these exact steps. This is just an example of the possible consequences prior to dismissal).</p> 
            <h4>Step 1:</h4> 
            <p>You will receive a verbal warning indicating you have violated a standard of behavior or performance which is unacceptable.</p> 
            <h4>Step 2:</h4> 
            <p>If the behavior continues, you will be given a written warning. This should be a signal that the behavior has not changed or improved and is serious enough o have written warning in your file.</p> 
            <h4>Step 3:</h4> 
            <p>At this point your behavior will have been discussed twice and your job is at risk. You will be informed that if the behavior continues, you will be asked to leave without discussion.</p> 
            <h4>Step 4:</h4> 
            <p>With the fourth occurrence you will be terminated by your supervisor and the student payroll coordinator will be notified. The dismissal will be documented and become part of your permanent file.</p>

          <h3>WA State Work Study</h3> 
          <p>     </p>
          <p>Another path you can travel with your Federal Work Study award is working with the Washington State Work Study Program (WSWS). This is a State program that is available to eligible college students to help them pay for education. If you are eligible, this program provides you with the opportunity to work off campus in your field of study in a business contracted with the state. Many times when you have the opportunity to work in the field of your study and you like the fit, your motivation to be academically successful takes on a new light.</p> 
          <div class="accordion"> 
           <h3>Advantages</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>There are numerous benefits for you if you decide to work with the Washington State Work Study program. The program itself was designed to assist both the individual student as well as the employer. Some of the advantages are:</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>You will be working in a business setting similar to your course of study. You will see first hand and early in your educational pursuit whether this type of work is a good fit for you or not.</li> 
             <li>The wage you will be earning is determined by the business, based on your skills and the current rate for that type of employment. In most cases you will be paid more in this program than working on campus.</li> 
             <li>You will be able to see how your work performance measures up in the working world and at the same time have a chance to develop new resume skills.</li> 
             <li>Net working with people in a business you are pursuing will be an advantage later on when you are looking for permanent employment.</li> 
             <li>Sometimes, internship programs for college credit can be combined with your Washington State Work Study employment.</li> 
             <li>Many times businesses will permanently hire you, full time or part time, because you have proved to have the work ethics, skills, and attitudes they are looking for in a permanent employee. On the other hand, you also have had a chance to decide whether you would like to work in this particular employment environment. These major decisions for both employee and employer comes together under the guidelines of the Washington State Work Study program.</li> 
            </ol>
           </div> 
           <h3>Hiring Process</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you are eligible for and interested in the Washington State Work Study employment program, contact the student payroll coordinator, located in LSC-231, extension 2447. The student payroll coordinator will explain the program in detail to you, provide you with a student handbook, and ask the pertinent questions that will assist her in helping you find employment within the program.</p> 
            <p>The student payroll coordinator will have job listings available submitted by off campus contracted community employers. If the description and qualifications for a particular job in your field of study sounds like a good fit, ask the student payroll coordinator for a Referral Letter. This letter will introduce you to a perspective employer who will schedule a regular job interview with you. You may or may not be hired based on your available hours and your skill level for the job. This referral letter also provides pertinent information to help the business base their decision to hire you and requires signatures from Green River Community College, the employer and you. As part of the hiring process, the business will provide you with the necessary employment papers.</p> 
            <p>If you are hired, the original referral letter must be signed and returned to the student payroll coordinator. You then become an “employee” of the business. The business will issue you a pay check in accordance with their payroll system and process.</p> 
            <p>If there are no job opportunities in your field of study and you know of a business interested in becoming a Washington State Work Study employer, talk with the student payroll coordinator. She will approach the business with contract information. If the business is interested, paperwork and approval takes about a month.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Release of Information</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>All student educational and financial records are maintained according to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which means, by federal law, no information regarding your records is disclosed to any one person (including mothers, fathers, spouses, children), school, agency, business, etc. without your written permission.</p> 
            <p>The <a href="Documents/student-services/financial-aid/autorization-to-release-confidential-information.pdf" title="Release Form" target="_blank">Release of Information Form</a>&nbsp;used in the financial aid office is good for the length of time you are attending Green River Community College. It can be updated (added to or deleted from) any time you wish. After leaving Green River, in the event you apply for jobs off campus, be sure to update your Release of Information with the student payroll coordinator, otherwise no information will be released regarding your employment at Green River Community College.</p> 
            <p>Now that you are confident that the financial aid office will not release any information concerning your activities here, as an employee of an off campus employer you will be expected to protect the identity and activity of anyone at the business where you work.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Work Hours/Schedules/Wages</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you are hired within the Washington State Work Study program, your work hours and schedule will be determined by your availability and the business or agency need. You cannot exceed working the maximum 19 hours per week. During the breaks, when you are not in class at Green River Community College, you may work more hours if you have the money and the student payroll coordinator approves the change in schedule. If the amount of your award for the quarter is earned prior to the end of the quarter, you must stop working until the beginning of the next quarter, unless your employer is willing to accept full cost (100%) of your hourly wage.</p> 
            <p>The wage you will be offered is determined by the business. The state requires that you are paid an hourly wage by check. The business assumes all employer costs and must maintain accurate payroll records of your earnings for auditing purposes.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Time Sheet Process</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>As an employee within the Washington State Work Study program working for an off campus contracted business, you will be required to complete the time sheet process used by the business for payment of hours worked.</p> 
            <p>The student payroll coordinator will supply the business with the reimbursement time sheets. The business will be required to submit to the student payroll coordinator WSWS time sheets for reimbursement on your wages. You will be required to sign these time sheets prior to submission. Make sure your time is accurately recorded, in pen, and added correctly at the bottom. You will be completing these time sheets after you have been paid by the business.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h3>Responsibilities and Expectations</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p>Your responsibilities and expectations for employment with a business in the Washington State Work Study program should be discussed with you by the business contact at the time of hire.</p> 
            <p>Remember you also represent the quality of students who are attending Green River Community College. Your work performance, behavior and attitude will reflect on the campus community here. Be responsible, dependable, and willing to be an effective team player whatever your job description requires.</p> 
            <p>Your student employee responsibilities off campus in a business/agency will generally be the same as on campus employee expectations.</p> 
            <p>Your responsibilities as a student employee are:</p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Be committed to perform the tasks agreed upon with supervisor</li> 
             <li>Be flexible and willing to learn new tasks</li> 
             <li>Be on time, keep the work schedule agreed upon. If the schedule is not working, try to create a workable one</li>

           </div> 
           <h3>Termination/Dismissal/Transfer Requests</h3> 
           <div> 
            <p><strong>Termination:</strong></p> 
            <p>Unfortunately sometimes students are not as academically successful as they would like to be for various reasons. At the end of each quarter the financial aid office will determine which students are terminated from financial aid, based on the previous quarter’s performance. You will receive a letter from financial aid informing you of the termination. If you are terminated from financial aid, you are also terminated from your Washington State Work Study position. See the financial aid office immediately for options to reinstate your financial aid and Washington State Work Study award. When you have been reinstated, contact the student payroll coordinator (LSC-231, extension 2447) immediately to see if you are able to continue your off campus employment.</p> 
            <p><strong>Dismissal:</strong></p> 
            <p>Your work ethics and performance as a Washington State Work Study employee contribute to your own success as an individual student as well as to the business environment in which you work. When responsibilities are ignored, job expectations should be enforced. The student payroll coordinator will contact the business periodically where you are working to make sure your efforts there are consistent and acceptable. If this is not the case, your employer will be encouraged to dismiss you and you will be asked to seek employment elsewhere.</p> 
            <p><strong>Transfer Requests:</strong></p> 
            <p>If you want to transfer from your Washington State Work Study commitment to an on campus supervisor, see the student payroll coordinator. You will be asked to continue in your present position until the end of the quarter. At the start of the next quarter you will be informed of any open positions on campus.</p>

           <h4>I am going to run out of money before the quarter ends, can I still work?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>When you have earned your work study award amount for the quarter, you must stop working until the next quarter begins.</p> 
            <p></p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>I am not eligible for work study, are there any other jobs on campus?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you are not eligible for work study, you might consider talking with instructors in the various divisions or departments to see if they have money to pay you to work.</p> 
            <p></p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Why do I have to have an original social security card?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>To meet IRS regulations, the Green River payroll office requires that you produce your original social security card to the student payroll coordinator.</p> 
            <p></p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>I thought my check was mailed, but I didn’t receive it, now what?</h4>

            <p></p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>I have financial aid, but I don’t have work study, why?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you asked for work study but did not receive it, make arrangements to talk with someone in the financial aid office for an explanation.</p>

           </div> 
           <h4>Do I have to stand in line for my job each quarter? Each year?</h4> 
           <div>

           </div> 
           <h4>My supervisor says he has money to pay me to work. How do I get paid?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Divisions/departments have some money set aside to hire students throughout the year. If the department head or division chair has money to hire you, you must complete the hiring process BEFORE you begin working. See the student payroll coordinator for details (LSC 231 – extension 2447).</p> 
            <p></p> 
           </div>
