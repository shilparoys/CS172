        <p><strong>WEB TERMS OF SERVICE</strong></p> 
        <ol> 
         <li><strong>About the Web Services Terms of Service and Web Services</strong></li> 
         <p>Within these Web Services Terms of Service (“Terms“) the term “Comcast” or “we” will refer to Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates that own and operate Websites and Internet services on their behalf. The term “you” refers to you as a user of Comcast’s Websites or Internet services described below.</p> 
         <p>These Terms set forth the terms and conditions through which Comcast will permit you to use the Local Media Development sites as well as Comcast-owned and operated websites and services based on the POV and EveryBlock platform (the&nbsp;<strong>“Web Services“</strong>). A list of such websites can we found at www.mspro.comcastlmd.com&nbsp;(the&nbsp;<strong>“Web Services“</strong>).</p> 
         <p><strong>What is outside the scope of these Terms?</strong><br> These Terms do not apply to your use of any other products or services provided by Comcast such as XFINITY, Comcast Digital Cable with On Demand, Comcast Digital Voice, and Comcast High Speed Internet. If you subscribe to or use one or more of these services, you can see the terms that apply to the residential versions of these services by visiting <a href="http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html" target="_blank">http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html</a>.</p> 
         <p>These Terms also do not apply to your use of the XFINITY TV Store (xfinitytvstore.comcast.net). Comcast’s use of the information you provide through the XFINITY TV Store is described in the XFINITY TV Store Privacy Policy, available at <a href="http://xfinitytvstore.comcast.net/TermsOfUse.aspx" target="_blank">http://xfinitytvstore.comcast.net/TermsOfUse.aspx</a>. Some of the Web Services contain links to other Websites, including Websites of third parties who are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers, or providers. These other Websites are not operated by Comcast and have their own terms of service that we encourage you to read before you use them. Other sites that we link to may contain Comcast branding, but these non-Comcast Websites and resources are provided by companies or persons other than Comcast. Examples of these non-Comcast Websites include Websites where you are required to log-in using a username and password other than your username and password for the Web Services, such as the Jobs channel and the Dating channel on Comcast.net. These Terms do not apply to those non-Web Services. Those sites will have their own terms of use that we encourage you to read before you use them.</p> 
         <li><strong>Accepting These Terms</strong></li> 
         <p>In order for you to use any of the Web Services, you must first agree to abide by the Terms. You can accept these Terms by:</p> 
         <ol> 
          <li>Checking the box next to “I have read and agree to the Terms of Service” (or similar language); or</li> 
          <li>Using any of the Web Services, in which case you understand and agree that these Terms will apply to your use of those services (or any parts of them).</li> 
         </ol> 
         <p>Before you continue to use the Web Services, you should print or save a local copy of the Terms for your records.</p> 
         <li><strong>Registration</strong></li> 
         <p>In order to use the Web Services you may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process. You agree that any registration information you give to Comcast will be accurate, correct, and current.</p> 
         <li><strong>Prohibited Uses</strong></li> 
         <p>You specifically agree not to:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li>use the Web Services to undertake or accomplish any unlawful purpose, including but not limited to, posting, storing, transmitting or disseminating information, data or material which is libelous, obscene, unlawful, threatening or defamatory, or which infringes the intellectual property rights of any person or entity, or which in any way constitutes or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, or otherwise violate any local, state, federal, or non-U.S. law, order, or regulation;</li> 
          <li>post, store, send, transmit, or disseminate on the Web Services any information or material which a reasonable person could deem to be unlawful;</li> 
          <li>upload, post, publish, transmit, reproduce, create derivative works of, or distribute on the Web Services in any way information, software or other material that is protected by copyright or other proprietary right, without obtaining any required permission of the owner;</li> 
          <li>post on the Web Services unsolicited bulk or commercial messages commonly known as “spam;”</li> 
          <li>send very large numbers of copies of the same or substantially similar messages, empty messages, or messages which contain no substantive content, or send very large messages or files that disrupt a blog, newsgroup, chat, or similar feature of the Web Services;</li> 
          <li>initiate, perpetuate, or in any way participate in any pyramid or other illegal scheme through the Web Services;</li> 
          <li>participate in the collection of very large numbers of e-mail addresses, screen names, or other identifiers of others (without their prior consent) from the Web Services, a practice sometimes known as spidering or harvesting, or participate in the use of software (including “spyware”) designed to facilitate this activity;</li> 
          <li>collect responses from unsolicited bulk messages posted on the Web Services;</li> 
          <li>impersonate any person or entity, engage in sender address falsification, forge anyone else’s digital or manual signature, or perform any other similar fraudulent activity (for example, “phishing”) on the Web Services;</li> 
          <li>restrict, inhibit, or otherwise interfere with the ability of any other person, regardless of intent, purpose or knowledge, to use or enjoy the Web Services (except for tools for safety and security functions such as parental controls, for example), including, without limitation, posting or transmitting any information or software which contains a worm, virus, or other harmful feature, or generating levels of traffic sufficient to impede others’ ability to use, send, or retrieve information;</li> 
          <li>register under the name of, nor attempt to use the Web Services under the name of, another person;</li> 
          <li>allow another person to access the Web Services using your credentials;</li> 
          <li>access (or attempt to access) the Web Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers), except through APIs or other interfaces specifically provided for this purpose, or violate the instructions set out in any robots.txt or similar file present within the Web Services;</li> 
          <li>engage in the systematic retrieval of data or other content from the Web Services, except though APIs or other interfaces specifically provided for this purpose, to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory, without Comcast’s prior written consent;</li> 
          <li>capture, rip, download, or otherwise create a copy of any content that is shown on the Web Services without obtaining any required permission of the content owner; or</li> 
          <li>take any actions for the purpose of manipulating or distorting, or that may undermine the integrity and accuracy of, any ratings or reviews of any movie or other entertainment program, service or product that may be presented by the Comcast Service.</li> 
          <li>attempt to or actually circumvent any method used by Comcast to control access to the Web Services, including, but not limited to, spoofing or otherwise impersonating an IP address for your computer that is not actually assigned to your computer or setting up a proxy or other device that allows others to access the Web Services through it.</li> 
         </ul> 
         <p>If you are a Comcast High Speed Internet customer, you can find the guidelines for acceptable use of the Internet service, including any Comcast email or webmail services, at <a href="http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html" target="_blank">http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html</a>.</p> 
         <li><strong>Your Passwords and Unauthorized Use of Your Account</strong></li> 
         <p>You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password(s) you use to access the Web Services. Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to Comcast for all activities that occur under your Web Services accounts, and will be responsible for any breach of these Terms caused by these activities. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Comcast immediately.</p> 
         <li><strong>Privacy and Your Personal Information</strong></li> 
         <p>To understand how the Web Services use information you provide, please read the Web Services Privacy Policy at <a href="http://mspro.comcastlmd.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">http://mspro.comcastlmd.com/privacy-policy/</a>. This policy explains how Comcast and its providers handle your personal information when you register and use the Web Services.</p> 
         <li><strong>Content on the Web Services</strong></li> 
         <p>The Web Services will allow you to access information, such as collections of data, video, audio, or other multimedia, and photographs and other static images (the “Content“). This Content may be owned by Comcast, other companies that give Comcast the right to distribute their Content (like movie publishers), or users of the Web Services (like you). Comcast grants you a limited license to view the Content and to use the Web Services for personal, non-commercial purposes as set forth in these Terms or in a manner that does not require a license. Unless the Content was legally posted by you on the Web Services or you use one of the variety of content sharing tools provided by the Web Services, you may not distribute copies of the Content in any form (including by e-mail or other electronic means), without prior written permission from its owner except as permitted by law. Of course, you are free to encourage others to access the Content and to tell them how to find it, including using the sharing tools provided by the Web Services.</p> 
         <p>In addition, our Content providers want to remind you that you must not remove, alter, interfere with, or circumvent any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices marked on the Content or any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure associated with the Content. The copying, downloading, stream capturing, reproduction, duplication, archiving, distribution, uploading, publication, modification, translation, broadcast, performance, display, sale, or transmission of the Content is strictly prohibited unless it is expressly permitted by Comcast in writing or through tools provided by Web Services. You may not incorporate the Content into any hardware or software application. This prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the derivative materials free of charge.</p> 
         <p>You understand that by using the Web Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable. In this respect, you use the Web Services at your own risk. If you would like to use them, there are commercially available services and software that can limit exposure to material that you may find objectionable. For those who are customers, the Comcast High Speed Internet service provides security information and tools for all users, including parents, at <a href="http://security.comcast.net/." target="_blank">http://security.comcast.net/</a>. Some of the tools may require that you be a registered Comcast High Speed Internet user in order to download and use them.</p> 
         <li><strong>User Submissions</strong></li> 
         <p>Some of the material appearing on the Web Services will be provided by users. Comcast does not claim ownership of any material that users submit or post on the Web Services. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Comcast has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any material that you create, transmit, or display while using the Web Services, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Comcast may suffer) by doing so. Further, you agree that, with respect to any communication you submit to us for posting on the Web Services, you will not: (i) include any content that violates a third party’s copyright or other proprietary or privacy rights; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations portrayed as fact; (iii) include any advertising or solicitations; or (iv) submit any material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise clearly inappropriate.</p> 
         <p>If you post any content to the Web Services, you hereby grant Comcast and its licensees a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute the content, on or in connection with the Web Services or the promotion of the Web Services, and incorporate it in other works, in whole or in part, in any manner. You represent and warrant that you own the content or otherwise have sufficient rights in it to grant to Comcast the license set forth in this section without infringing or violating the rights of any third party. If you remove content that you have posted to the Web Services or terminate your Web Services account, this license will automatically expire, with a few limited exceptions. Comcast may retain, but will not actively use, copies of your data that were archived in the normal course of Comcast’s database backups. In addition, copies of content that you have shared with other users of the Web Services may be retained by Comcast and associated with those other users’ accounts in order to provide them with the Web Services. Comcast does not assert any ownership over content that you post to the Web Services; rather, as between us and you, subject to the rights granted to us in these Terms, you retain full ownership of all content you post to the Web Services and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with the content.</p> 
         <p>The Web Services may also contain links to community forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs about the various Web Services. Children under the age of 13 should not post in any of the forums, boards, chat rooms, blogs, other editorial sections of the Web Services. Participants in these forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs are solely responsible for all content that they post there. Comcast retains the right, but not the obligation, to correct any errors or omissions in any of this content, as it may determine in its sole discretion. Comcast further reserve the right to delete or remove any content from the forums or blogs without prior notice or liability. You agree that your participation in these forums, bulletin boards, chat rooms, and blogs will at all times conform with the policy available here: http://mspro.comcastlmd.com/privacy-policy/.</p> 
         <p>Comcast reserves the right, but does not assume any obligation, to review any user submission prior to its display on the Web Services using automated tools or manual processes. Comcast may refuse to display or remove any user submission from the Web Services for any reason in our sole discretion. However, we will typically only do so when we become aware that the material in question is harmful, clearly illegal, or likely to be considered highly offensive or objectionable to a large segment of our users.</p> 
         <li><strong>Feedback</strong></li> 
         <p>Comcast welcomes your feedback about the Web Services. Comcast asks that you limit your feedback to the Web Services. Any communications you send to Comcast are deemed to be submitted on a non-confidential basis and become the sole property of Comcast. Comcast may, in its sole discretion, reproduce, use, publish, modify, disclose, distribute, or otherwise use these communications in any way and for any purpose. All of these uses by Comcast shall be without liability or obligation of any kind to you. These uses may include, for example, use of the content of any of these communications, including any works, marks or names, ideas, inventions, concepts, techniques or know-how disclosed therein, for any purpose without any obligation to compensate the originator of the communications and without liability to that person.</p> 
         <li><strong>Proprietary Rights</strong></li> 
         <p>You acknowledge and agree that Comcast (or Comcast’s licensors) own all legal right, title, and interest in and to the Web Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Web Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p> 
         <p>Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Comcast, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Comcast’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names (including the name of this web site), and other distinctive brand features except as permitted by law. If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Comcast, then you agree that your use of these features shall be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Comcast’s brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time.</p> 
         <p>Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Comcast, you agree that in using the Web Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of these marks, names or logos.</p> 
         <li><strong>Linking to the Web Services</strong></li> 
         <p>Comcast welcomes links to the homepages of any of the Web Services. You are free to establish a hypertext link to these homepages so long as the link does not state or imply any affiliation, connection, sponsorship, or approval of your site by Comcast. Comcast does not permit framing or inline linking to the Web Services or any portions of them.</p> 
         <li><strong>License from Comcast</strong></li> 
         <p>Comcast gives you a worldwide, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Web Services for your personal, non-commercial use on the terms and conditions described in these Terms. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Web Services as provided by Comcast, in the manner permitted by the Terms.</p> 
         <li><strong>Discontinuing Use of the Web Services and Termination of the Terms; Provisions That Remain in Effect after Termination</strong></li> 
         <p>The Terms apply to all users of the Web Services. Except as described below, depending on whether you are an unregistered user or a registered user, you can discontinue your use of the Web Services so that these Terms no longer apply to you.</p> 
         <p><strong>Unregistered Users</strong><br> If you use any of the Web Services (or parts of those services) that are accessible without registration, you may discontinue use of those services at any time. Doing so will terminate the Terms. If you breach any provision of these Terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, Comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your use of the Web Services and terminate the Terms. We may take these actions with or without notice to you. Because unregistered users are generally unknown to us, in most cases we will be unable to give notice of these actions.<br> <strong>Registered Users</strong><br> If you use any of the Web Services (or parts of those services) as a registered user, you may terminate your registered user account at any time. Doing so will delete your account and, because you can no longer use the service associated with that account, terminate the Terms with respect to that service. If you breach any provision of these Terms or other applicable policies, or for any other reason, Comcast reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your registered user account for any or all of the Web Services and terminate the Terms. We may take these actions with or without notice to you. Because registered users are known to us, however, we will generally use reasonable efforts to give notice of these actions.</p> 
         <p>Sections 8, 10, 13 through 16, and 22 of these Terms will survive termination, and shall continue to apply indefinitely.</p> 
         <li><strong>EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</strong></li> 
         <p>YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEB SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEB SERVICES, AND THE INHERENT HAZARDS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION, THERE MAY BE INTERRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OMISSIONS, INACCURACIES, OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS INFORMATION. IF YOU RELY ON THE WEB SERVICES OR ANY MATERIAL AVAILABLE THROUGH THEM, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM ANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA DOWNLOADED FROM OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED THROUGH THE WEB SERVICES.</p> 
         <p>THE WEB SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” COMCAST AND ITS AGENTS AND LICENSORS CANNOT AND DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, USEFULNESS, TIMELINESS, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEB SERVICES, NOR DO THEY GUARANTEE THAT THE WEB SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, OR CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, OR THAT THE WEB SERVICES WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p> 
         <li><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></li> 
         <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL COMCAST (INCLUDING ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES) OR ITS AGENTS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY USE OR MISUSE OF THE WEB SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED BEFOREHAND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OR CAUSE OF ACTION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, AND OTHER TORT ACTIONS. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THESE STATES, THE LIABILITY OF COMCAST AND ITS AGENTS AND LICENSORS IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW. YOU AGREE THAT THE LIABILITY OF COMCAST (INCLUDING ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES) AND ITS AGENTS AND LICENSORS, IF ANY, ARISING OUT OF ANY KIND OF LEGAL CLAIM IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE WEB SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO COMCAST FOR THE USE OF THE WEB SERVICES.</p> 
         <li><strong>Indemnification</strong></li> 
         <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Comcast (including its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third-party information providers) against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any breach of the Terms or unauthorized use of the Web Services. Comcast reserves the right, at its election to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you and you agree to cooperate with Comcast in connection with our defense.</p> 
         <li><strong>Copyright Infringement</strong></li> 
         <p>Comcast is committed to complying with U.S. copyright and related laws, and requires all users of the Web Services to comply with these laws. Accordingly, you may not use the Web Services to store any material or content, or disseminate any material or content, in any manner that constitutes an infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including rights granted by U.S. copyright law.</p> 
         <p>If you are the owner of any copyrighted work and believe your rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed by any material on the Web Services, you may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA“) by sending Comcast’s authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA. Upon Comcast’s receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement, Comcast will respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove the allegedly infringing work(s) accessible through the Web Services or (ii) to disable access to the work(s). It is Comcast’s policy in accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws to reserve the right to terminate access to the Web Services (or any part of those services) for any user who is either found to infringe third party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing these rights. Comcast may terminate access to the Web Services at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user. If the affected user believes in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then that person may send a counter notification to Comcast. Upon Comcast’s receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, Comcast will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA’s procedures with respect to a received counter notification. In all events, you expressly agree that Comcast will not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.</p> 
         <p>Copyright owners may send Comcast a notification of claimed infringement to report alleged infringements of their works to:</p>

         <p>Any notification of claimed infringement must be in a form that satisfies the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act. Under the DMCA, anyone who knowingly makes misrepresentations regarding alleged copyright infringement may be liable to Comcast, the alleged infringer, and the affected copyright owner for any damages incurred in connection with the removal, blocking, or replacement of allegedly infringing material.</p> 
         <p>If a notification of claimed infringement has been filed against you, you can file a counter notification with Comcast’s designated agent using the contact information shown above. All counter notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act.</p>
