        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DATE: November 19, 2014</strong></p> 
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students,</strong><br><br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> This past week we saw a dip in temperatures which can lead to ice on the roads. As we approach the winter months, ice, snow, and slick roads, are a concern to everyone trying to drive to campus. In trying to drive to main campus, 312<sup>th</sup> can be dangerous if your vehicle is not 4-wheel drive, or you have snow tires and chains. In addition, snow, wind, and ice can be taxing on trees, meaning that braches and other missiles could cause damage to your vehicle for which the probability is low, but still exists.&nbsp; To prepare for this, Campus Safety has chains ready for our Vans and Buses to assist with anyone coming to main campus during these times, should they arise. Our recommendation for those vehicles that may not make it up 312<sup>th</sup> Street, and anyone else wishing to use the system, is to park at the Raceway and let us do the work for you. We will continue to provide at the raceway, hot coffee and hot water for tea and cocoa to keep you warm also. If you have any questions, please contact Campus Safety at ext. 3350</p> 
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank You,</p> 
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Rich Axtell</p>

        <p><strong>CAMPUS ADVISORY - Area Schools</strong><br><br><strong>DETAILS:</strong> As we all know, Green River Community College experience a lockdown on Monday due to a generalized, non-specific threat. Today, Kent-Meridian High School went into lock-down and Auburn High School went into increased monitoring activities. To date there have been 8 schools, including Tahoma High School, subject to threats from non-specific sources, which is causing problems with law enforcement agencies to identify the sources of these threats.<br><br>Green River Community College has been in contact with these affected school districts and law enforcement agencies to maximize our situational readiness under a joint investigative system for the purposes of working together to develop solutions. Campus Safety has been in continuous contact with King County and other law enforcement agencies involved in these investigations.<br><br>Although we are taking these threats seriously, the broad geographical range where these are occurring makes these threats more generalized than specific. We will continue to remain vigilant and ask that you do the same. <br><br>Any information you may have regarding Monday's threats or threats on any of our neighboring campuses, please contact Campus Safety at <a href="mailto:safetydispatch@greenriver.edu">safetydispatch@greenriver.edu</a> or 253-288-3350. <br><br></p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><strong>There have been a number of thefts occurring on and off campus which becomes frustrating to all of us. Although Campus Safety and law enforcement can take the reports and increase patrols, there are other tools to help mitigate the losses. One such tool is Trackmole,&nbsp;(www.trackmole.com) &nbsp;</strong></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.4;"><strong>and is currently being used by the Police Departments of Tukwila, Federal Way, Kent, Renton, and effective today the City of Auburn and now Green River Community College Campus Safety. <strong>This is a free service for you to register your valuables, electronics, bicycles, laptops, etc. Anything with a serial number. </strong>You would need to still file a report through Campus Safety or your local police department, but this will help streamline the recovery of your items.</strong></strong></p> 
        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><strong><br>TrackMole is a powerful property tracking and crime prevention tool that helps police departments and others identify owners of lost and stolen properties by using serial numbers. Instead of you having to look for your property, TrackMole allows your property to find you when you lose it or have left it behind at places like airports, airplanes, coffee shops, restaurants, taxi cabs, hotels, buses, trains, schools, parks, amusement parks or anywhere else. In a nutshell...quickly test it for yourself:</strong></strong></p> 
        <ol type="1"> 
         <li>Create and sign in to your TrackMole account (if you have an Amazon, Facebook, or Google+ account, this is as easy as a couple of mouse clicks).</li> 
         <li>Add something you own such as a laptop, phone, or tablet to your registered property list.</li> 
         <li>Click the "Sign out" link at the top of the page.</li> 
         <li>Now pretend that you're the finder and run the serial number through TrackMole. Within a couple of minutes, you, as the owner, will receive an e-mail notifying you that your property's serial number has been run through TrackMole.</li> 
         <li>Click on the "Report Your Find" button.</li> 
         <li>On the next page, select the "No, I turned this item in and wish to remain anonymous" option.</li> 
         <li>Type in a message and click the "Submit your find" button. Within minutes you'll receive another e-mail telling you where your property is and where to get it back.&nbsp;</li>
