        <td><p>In 1937, Ruth Kerr (among others) founded a school that in 1940 became a liberal arts college committed to the historic Christian faith. Wallace Emerson, the first president, envisioned an institution that rivaled the best colleges nationwide, and he set the standard for academic rigor and excellence that still applies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>By 1945, Westmont outgrew its facilities in Los Angeles and moved to the former Dwight Murphy estate in Santa Barbara with its 125 acres and beautiful Mediterranean house. Acquiring another property and the former Deane School for Boys completed the campus that features the pathways, stone bridges, and gardens of the former estate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Achieving accreditation in 1958, Westmont began building its campus in the 1960s, adding nine major buildings. Enrollment rose to 840, and in 1976, the college received approval for 1,200 students. In 2007, the county authorized an updated campus master plan, and Westmont began the first phase of construction in 2008.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent decades, Westmont has earned increasing national recognition for its academic quality, leadership training and unique emphasis on intellectual, spiritual and personal growth. During his 25-year tenure, President David K. Winter helped the college attract a highly qualified faculty, create a vital Christian community, and make plans for constructing additional campus facilities. President Stan D. Gaede continued this work between 2001-2006. David Winter returned as chancellor and interim president for a year until Gayle D. Beebe became the eighth president in July 2007. His priorities include implementing the master plan and building a strong financial base for the 21st century. He presided over groundbreaking ceremonies for Adams Center for the Visual Arts and Winter Hall for Science and Mathematics in October 2008, which began a period of construction that will include up to five buildings and new athletic fields. <br> </p></td>
