          <h3>Green River High School Completion Program</h3> 
          <p>     </p>
          <p>The Green River High School Completion Program, which earns credits towards high school requirements, can be an alternative way to complete high school. Although it is designed for adult students, 19 years and older, who wish to achieve one or more of the objectives above, students under 19 can participate under certain circumstances (See "How does age affect my participation?" under Frequently Asked Questions). Successful students will meet state and Green River requirements for graduation and will be issued an official State of Washington high school diploma.</p> 
          <p>Depending on a student's assessment/placement scores, college level classes may be taken to fulfill both high school and college degree requirements at the same time. Green River's COMPASS should be taken prior to enrolling in classes.</p> 
          <p>For those students who started, or would have started, high school prior to September 2004, a high school diploma from Green River requires the following credits:</p>

          <p>* Washington State History is a course taken in middle school or junior high school, and often does not appear on high school transcripts. If it does not appear on your high school transcript, go to your middle school or junior high and get documentation on letterhead in a sealed envelope that you successfully completed the course. Deliver the envelope to Enrollment Services along with your high school transcripts.</p> 
          <p>Five college credits are equal to one high school credit.</p> 
          <p>EXAMPLE: Reading 094 = 5 Green River &nbsp;credits = 1 high school credit</p> 
          <p>For those students who started, or would have started, their high school freshman year in September, 2004, or later, new high school rules apply. These rules include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) Successful completion of the HSPE or equivalent assessment as identified by the OSPI in accordance with state policies, (2) Culminating project, (3) Career plan, and (4) Completion of required credit courses (listed above). If mathematics is needed, then math 97 intermediate algebra or higher must be completed.</p> 
          <p>Students who have been home schooled and would have entered their freshman year September 2004 or later are also bound to the new rules.</p>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3> 
          <p>     </p>
          <div class="faq"> 
           <h4>When should I apply?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>It is recommended that you apply a month or more in advance of the quarter you plan to begin your classes. An application must be received, assessment completed and official transcripts evaluated prior to your registration. If you apply late you may have to delay your start until the next quarter.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>How much will it cost?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you are 19 years of age or older and a resident of Washington State, tuition for all credit classes which apply to your program will cost $12.00 per credit for the first 18 credits. There will be additional technology, special service, class and facilities fees that are paid by all Green River students. You will also be responsible for any class supplies and your books. Books can be priced at Green River's bookstore, The Paper Tree, in the Lindbloom Student Center.</p> 
            <p>If you are 18 or younger and a resident of Washington State, you pay full tuition at the same rate as other community college students. Call (253) 833-9111, ext. 2500, for current tuition rates.</p> 
            <p>If you are NOT a resident of Washington State and are 19 years of age or older, the non-resident part of your tuition is waived and you must pay full resident tuition.</p> 
            <p>Tuition waivers may be revoked if academic progress is not maintained.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>Do high school completion classes count towards college or vocational degree credit?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>If your English, reading and math skills are at a high enough level, you may take 100 level classes instead of high school level classes. College or vocational credit classes may be used to meet high school requirements. These classes would count for both your high school diploma and your college transfer or professional/technical degree.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>What is the difference between a GED® and a high school diploma?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>The GED® exam is a series of five tests in the following subjects: Writing Skills, Social Studies, Science, Interpreting Literature, and Mathematics.</p> 
            <p>A high school diploma is granted only after high school course work has been completed and the required credits earned.</p> 
            <p>You can talk to an Advisor about the best decision for you.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>If I have a GED® can I still obtain a high school diploma?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>Yes. Contact an Advisor.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>What if I were home-schooled?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>You must submit a notarized letter from the person who provided the instruction stating that you were home-schooled. Work completed through home-schooling does not meet high school diploma requirements. All credits applied toward a diploma must be earned from a recognized high school or other accredited institution.</p> 
           </div> 
           <h4>How does my age effect my participation?</h4> 
           <div> 
            <p>If you are 19 or older there are no restrictions on your participation. If you are 16, 17 or 18 years of age you need a completed Green River High School Release form from your local high school, even if you did not attend classes there. See steps below. Green River does not admit students under the age of 16.</p> 
            <p><strong>If you are not enrolled in a high school, complete the following steps.</strong></p> 
            <ol type="a"> 
             <li>If age 16, 17, or 18, submit a completed high school release form from the high school you would normally be attending. This is a Green River form that high schools typically have. A letter from school district personnel on official school stationary can be substituted.</li> 
             <li>Complete a Green River application form. Contact Enrollment Services, (253) 833-9111, ext. 2500.</li> 
             <li>Complete Green River's COMPASS assessment. Call the Assessment Center for information, (253) 833-9111, ext. 2650.</li> 
             <li>Submit official copies of all high school transcripts in an envelope sealed by the high school for evaluation.</li> 
             <li>Make an appointment with Phil Smith to review your credits prior to the start of the quarter, (253) 833-9111, ext. 2641.</li> 
            </ol> 
            <p><strong>If you are enrolled in high school and want to receive your diploma from that high school, complete the following steps.</strong></p> 
            <ol> 
             <li>Submit a completed high school release form from your high school. Green River supplies these forms to the high schools. This form MUST specify the classes you may take at Green River. You are responsible for providing proof that all prerequisites for classes you plan to take have been met. This must be provided prior to registration. This form must be completed for each quarter that you register for classes that apply to your diploma.</li> 
             <li>Complete a Green River application for admission form. Contact Enrollment Services, (253) 833-9111, ext. 2500. This only needs to be done prior to your first quarter at Green River.</li> 
             <li>Complete Green River's COMPASS assessment. Call the Assessment Center for information, (253) 833-9111, ext. 2650.</li> 
             <li>Meet with an Advisor. Call (253) 833-9111, ext. 2641 to schedule an appointment.</li>
