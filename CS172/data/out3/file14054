  <ol> 
   <li>We load all classes and all faculty into Canvas about the same time as registration begins for a new quarter.
    <ol> 
     <li>Every class is loaded into Canvas every quarter so it isn't necessary to file a request to use Canvas.</li> 
     <li>We add students to all classes on the Friday before the start of a new quarter.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>After the initial uploads, Canvas is updated daily. &nbsp;We add newly enrolled students/faculty and delete those who've dropped.&nbsp; We also update the class list by adding new ones and deleting canceled classes.&nbsp; Because we don't have access to live data there is a delay of 1-2 business days from the time changes occur and when they show up in Canvas.
    <ol> 
     <li>IBC (<a href="https://grcc.greenriver.edu/ibc/waci100.html">Instructor Briefcase</a>)&nbsp;data are live so changes will appear on your IBC roster before they appear in Canvas , generally 24 hours before..</li> 
     <li>Because of the way the college (not eLearning) processes data over the weekend, any registration activity that takes place on Friday-Monday will not show up in Canvas until Tuesday.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>If you've just been added as the professor for a class, it will appear in Canvas 1-2 business days after you see it in your <a href="https://grcc.greenriver.edu/ibc/waci100.html">IBC</a>.
    <ol> 
     <li>It will take longer for the class to appear in IBC and Canvas for newly hired faculty because paperwork has to be processed by several departments before the class appears in IBC and then in Canvas.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>We tell students classes start after noon on the first day of the quarter (announcement posted on the Canvas login page).&nbsp; Faculty are free to publish their classes any time before the first day of the quarter (see 8 below).</li> 
   <li><span class="auto-style1">We automatically combine sections of the same class taught by the same professor using the same modality.&nbsp; For example if you are teaching two Math 156 classes on campus, you'll have one Canvas shell for that class and all students from both sections will be enrolled.&nbsp; If you were teaching an on-campus section of Math 156 and an online section, you would have two different Canvas shells.&nbsp; It's the same class but different modalities (online and on-campus).&nbsp; We can separate any combined class if you want.&nbsp; Send a request to </span> <a href="mailto:jmarshall@greenriver.edu"><span class="auto-style1">Jerry Marshall</span></a><span class="auto-style1">.&nbsp; Include the item numbers and class names for each section..</span>
    <ol> 
     <li>We can separate them if you want.&nbsp; Email <a href="mailto:jmarshall@greenriver.edu">Jerry Marshall</a> if you don't want them combined. 
      <o:p></o:p> 
      <ol> 
       <li class="MsoNormal"> 
        <o:p>
         To prevent confusion among your students, please let us know before students are enrolled which happens on the Friday before the quarter starts.
        </o:p></li> 
       <li class="MsoNormal">The ideal time is as soon as you can after classes are assigned to you.</li> 
      </ol> </li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>We have the ability to combine any combination of classes, for example, those in a learning community.&nbsp; Email requests to <a href="mailto:jmarshall@greenriver.edu">Jerry.</a>&nbsp; Include the class name, number and item number for each class along with your name for the combined class.</li> 
   <li>You can copy a previous Canvas class into a new shell.&nbsp; <a href="canvasvideos/coursecopy.wmv">video demo</a>&nbsp; Or you can import an Angel archive.&nbsp; <a href="canvasvideos/uploadangelarchiveintocanvaspart1.wmv">Part one of the Angel import</a>&nbsp; <a href="canvasvideos/canvasuploadpart2.wmv">Part 2</a></li> 
   <li>Classes have to be <strong>published</strong> (see video <a href="canvasvideos/publishcourse.wmv">demo</a>) before students can see them.&nbsp; This can't be done by the Canvas administrator.&nbsp; Only faculty assigned to the course can publish.&nbsp; </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p align="center"><b>End of quarter procedures for Canvas</b></p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>We set each quarter to end on the Friday of the week grades are due.&nbsp; We post an announcement on the login page of Canvas notifying all users of the date.
    <ol> 
     <li>After that Friday, we will move the start date for the just ended quarter to one far in the future to prevent students from being able to access closed classes</li> 
     <li>If we just end the quarter without reseting the start date, classes become read only.&nbsp; Students can no longer submit work but can still see everything they've done including any tests you've allowed them to see.</li> 
     <li class="auto-style1">If you add start/end dates to the course details tab of your course settings, all your students will still be able to see your class forever.&nbsp; This will happen regardless of what end date you add or our changes to the start described in 2.</li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>It's a good idea to archive your classes before the next quarter starts and download a copy of your grades.
    <ol> 
     <li>To Archive, enter your course&gt;select Settings from the left nav bar&gt;Export course content from the right nav bar&gt;leave course selected and hit the Create Export button.&nbsp; Canvas will email you when the export is ready. Choose the Click here to download link and save the file to H.&nbsp; <a href="canvasvideos/exportcourse.wmv">Video demo</a></li> 
    </ol> </li> 
   <li>We have no current plans to delete courses from Canvas; however, that can quickly change.&nbsp; The State Board has the Canvas contract so when they tell us to delete courses, we'll have to begin the process.
    <ol> 
     <li><strong>We won't begin deleting courses without several warnings. Best to archive courses as you go so if we need to start deleting, you'll be ready.</strong>&nbsp; </li> 
    </ol> </li>
