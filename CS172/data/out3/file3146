     <p> Evangelical Christians—globally considered—have become much more interested in and committed to stopping the gangrenous spread of human trafficking. This lecture will unpack the divergent strategies employed by evangelical "freedom fighters," offering a thicker narrative of evangelical involvement in this global pandemic of commodification of the human person. Themes of evangelical neo-colonialism, re-articulation of holistic mission, and the nature and extent of incarnational ministry will be explored in their Indian, Korean and American contexts. </p>

     <p>The supposed conflict between religion and science continues today to be a lynchpin of modern culture. But are all scientists really against religion? And are all Christians against science? Based on ten years of research on the religious beliefs of scientists and a recent comprehensive study of what religious people think about science, Elaine Howard Ecklund, Autrey Professor of Sociology at Rice University, will tell us what scientists think about faith, what people of faith think about science, and why we should care.</p>

AJS seeks to create a more just society, focusing on the poorest and most vulnerable sectors through the creation of more just legislation, by a more just application of current legislation, and by increasing the role of churches in promoting social justice. While working for Calvin College, Prof. Ver Beek has also carried out short-term consulting work with international development organizations, including World Vision and Tear Fund UK. </p>

     <p>&nbsp;</p> 
     <p> Some character traits, such as benevolence or courage, seem to have a fixed place in our catalog of virtues. But others have something like a life cycle: they rise and fall in importance over time, or move beyond the domain of virtue altogether. Humility, once a centrally important virtue, is today the subject of much skepticism. What is humility good for? Does it entail merely wimpishness, or a distorted sense of modesty? Is there a way of rescuing it for a secular context, so that we can once again wholeheartedly endorse and admire it as one of the virtues?</p>

     <p> In the past five years, a growing mom blogosphere has been changing the lives of contemporary mothers. While “mommy blogs” first rose to prominence as sources of social support and community, they have since evolved into a savvy industry. Seeking to re-construct their social identities and create a legitimate space of expanded public discourse, these women have used blogging and social media conferences as a means for achieving personal and collective empowerment. This lecture will explore how face-to-face social media conferences function as a key mechanism for creating solidarity and status for a largely online industry, and examine the double-edged nature of commercial empowerment for women and mothers seeking meaningful forms of cultural legitimacy.</p>

     <p> In 2002, an ossuary inscribed "James son of Joseph brother of Jesus" surfaced in the hands of a private collector. A few years later, a Discovery Channel documentary and related book claimed that the tomb of Jesus and his family has been found in Jerusalem. In this slide-illustrated lecture, we examine the validity of these sensational claims in light of archaeological and historical evidence for ancient Jewish tombs and burial customs in Jerusalem, including the burials of Jesus and his brother James. </p>
