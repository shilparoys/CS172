  <p>I was a steering committee member for <a href="http://www.project-time.org/"> Project TIME</a> -- an outreach project of Green River Community College.&nbsp; It was also a partnership with local school districts.&nbsp; We aimed to educate parents and students in both high school and middle school about the importance of taking as much math as possible in school -- and not to stop after they've satisfies the minimum requirements for graduation.&nbsp; To further this end, we developed a new course for high school students who would like to continue taking math after the second year of algebra but who might not be interested in the calculus track.&nbsp; To learn more, visit the web site for <a href="http://www.project-time.org">Project TIME</a>.</p>

  <p><b><font size="6" color="#008080">Careers In Math</font></b></p> 
  <p>I'm often asked what jobs one can get with a major in Mathematics.&nbsp; A mathematics degree opens a lot more doors than most people think.&nbsp; In addition to the obvious path (teaching), the training in logic and problem-solving skills prepares one to be a software engineer, actuary, cryptologist, engineering analyst, financial planner, investment analyst, technical writer, securities broker -- and this is just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; Here's a pretty good list of such jobs I found online at <a href="http://careerservices.rutgers.edu/Mmathstat.html">Rutger's,</a> and here's a page of profiles of recent graduates in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/Undergrad/Alumni/departments.html"> University of Washington</a>, including their backgrounds and the jobs they found because of their degrees.</p>
