Tom Corbett&rsquo;s budget unveiled on Tuesday. The governor has proposed a 52.4 percent reduction in Penn State&rsquo;s appropriation, which represents a decrease of $182 million. &ldquo;This is devastating news that could fundamentally change Penn State and our sister institutions in the state and have major negative impacts for the citizens of Pennsylvania and their families,&rdquo; Spanier said. &ldquo;Penn State&rsquo;s appropriation is mostly used to offset the cost of education for Pennsylvania residents, and the direct impact of these cuts would be to undermine the support of in-state tuition for Pennsylvania resident-students. It will undoubtedly push the cost of a Penn State education out of reach for many Pennsylvania families who are already at the maximum level for loans and grants.&rdquo;<br /><a href=\"http://giveto.psu.edu/?sid=1218&gid=1&calcid=2783&calpgid=61&pgid=252&ecid=2744&crid=0\">Continued...</a></div>");
