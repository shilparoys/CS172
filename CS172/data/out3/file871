     <p>Green River Community College's International Housing program began in 1989 with fifty host families and less than 100 international students. Today, in 2014, the program has grown to 450 active host families and between 1,600 and 1,700 international students. </p> 
     <p>More often than not, foreign exchange students build lifelong bonds with their host families and Green River truly values and embraces the importance of host families in the community. </p> 
     <p>Thank you to all of our host families for being kind, respectful, gracious and sharing your homes with our students. You help make this program the success that it is.</p>

             <p>I have been with International Programs since 1998 and enjoy working with both international students as well as host families. I started out as a host family myself and have hosted many students from several countries through the years. I am in contact with many of my former host students and have the joy of watching them grow up, reach their educational goals, get married and have a family. When I retire, my husband and I have joked that we will travel around the world and stay with all of our "international kids". </p> 
             <p>Green River offers a variety of housing options for international students. Campus Corner Apartments with 340 beds. We have more than 450 active host families in our Homestay program. We keep updated information for students who wish to have the ultimate independence and rent an apartment. We also help students find prospective roommates. My goal for housing is to meet the different needs of the individual student and find the most appropriate housing situation for them. As well as provide a fulfilling and great experience to our host families. </p> 
             <p>I am also committed to maintaining the highest standard of customer service to our students, agents and host families. I believe we have built a premier hosting program and are looked at as the best practices program for hosting in Washington State. </p>

             <p>My name is Lupita "Pete" Morales. "Pete" is a nickname I got in college many years ago and it has stuck.</p> 
             <p>I have a long history with international students. Growing up, my family was a host family so I understand that experience of welcoming someone into your home and making them feel welcome yet independent. As an adult I was an international student in Latin America. That experience is unique in that I was in a different country where no one spoke my native language; I was expected to be a successful student, I was away from my family, friends and everything I knew. It can be an exciting time yet stressful. Please know that I understand your experience as a host family and as the international student. I respect that process, am very conscious and sensitive of its challenges. Having said that, it is also the most rewarding and amazing experience one can have! Some 20 years later the international students we hosted in my home still send my mother holiday cards and photos of now their own children and refer to my mother as the "American Grandma". These students may not have been born into my family but they certainly are family. I still stay in contact with the family that hosted me in Latin America and plan on visiting them again in the near future so that they may meet my family.</p> 
             <p>I've found myself now as an adult, seeking careers in which I can be of service to the international student population. I graduated from GRCC with an AA degree and received an BA in Psychology at the University of Washington. I was a Focused Learning Tutor for the IESL International Program at GRCC and am now a part of the Housing team.</p> 
             <p>I am very honored to work with such a wonderful group of colleagues, students and host families. I'm looking forward to working with andgetting to know all of you.</p>

             <p>Hello, <em>Salut, Hallo, Ciao, Hujambo, Merhaba, NÃ­n hÇo</em>! My name is Emilee Findley; I have been with Green River Community College's IPEL team for a year and a half. Before my present position, I worked in the IESL (Intensive English as a Second Language) Department.</p>
             <p> </p>
             <p>I have always wanted to work with and for international students. At the age of 12, my family was involved in the international student exchange program by way of my eldest sister and the high school she attended. Through this experience, we were blessed to foster Teegan, an exchange student from Australia. It was this opportunity and life experience that enabled me to understand the blessings that such a person brings in to your life. This appreciation lent itself perfectly when I became a focal for the foreign housing and dormitory integration team while I attended Pacific Lutheran University. While on this team, I was again blessed to foster Oda, an international student from Norway. With these experiences, I have learned that diversity may be summarized by one word, acceptance. Accepting an individual or cultural practice that's not part of your own, requires open mindedness to personal growth, and understanding differences should not be viewed as challenges but opportunities. Regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, physicality, religion, socio-economic status, or age, we all have special talents and deserve acceptance and respect. Regardless of the package we were delivered in, we are all the same gift. </p> 
             <p>I feel very privileged to be part of the IPEL team, which includes our host families, students and everyone in between! </p>

             <p>I feel I have a unique relationship with Green River College. Having a parent who's worked for this college for over twenty years, I've spent a lot of time on campus. I've seen the changes and growth in both the campus and its students. It was no coincidence that I chose to attend and graduate from Green River before transferring to the University of Washington to receive my Bachelor's degree in 2009. After graduation, I spent the next few years working in the healthcare field, which was a great experience, but I never felt it was the right fit for me. So in April 2014, I returned to Green River to work part-time assisting the International Front Reception and International Housing. I love working here and I am honored be part of the International Programs and Extended Learning program at Green River College. I love interacting with our students and getting to know some of them on a personal level. We have some of the best students in the WORLD! I love building relationships with our amazing host families through home visits. In December 2014, I accepted a permanent position in the IP Housing department. Part of this new position is to work closely with the Short Term Program. I am excited to have the opportunity to help this program grow and to have even more interaction with our students. I am looking forward to all the new adventures working in IPEL will bring!</p> 
             <p>I currently live in Federal Way with my husband and our two young sons.</p>

        </div> 
        <h4>What if my student has a friend that wants to move in with us? </h4> 
        <div> 
         <p>Contact the Housing Office. At no time should a student move into your home without our knowledge.</p> 
        </div> 
        <h4>What do I do when my student moves out?</h4> 
        <div>

        </div> 
        <h4>Where can I take my student for banking needs?</h4> 
        <div> 
         <p>We recommend the Auburn branches of Wells Fargo and Chase. Both these locations will give students under 18 a checking account with a debit card. This way they don't have to carry cash around. Bank of America will also support our students; but students under 18 are unable to open a checking account. They have a limited number of withdrawals available during the quarter. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h4>Where can I take my student if he/she is sick or injured?</h4> 
        <div> 
         <p>We recommend taking your student to a MultiCare location. We have worked to make the process as smooth as possible when working with them. You will need to bring the student's medical release form and proper identification. They will ask you to sign a form consenting to treatment which is acceptable with their medical release. Do NOT sign anything that says you are financially responsible. Email or come by the IP office with questions. Call the emergency line if there is an emergency, after you have called 911. </p> 
        </div> 
        <h4>Where can I take my student if he/she needs dental assistance?</h4> 
        <div> 
         <p>William Sutton, DDS provides reduced rates for students. He is located at 1002 Harvey Road, Auburn - (253) 833-2290. Alternatively, students can purchase dental insurance though <a href="http://www.dentalhealthservices.com/members/smart-smile/intro.cfm?agentId=W2521">LewerMark Student Insurance</a> for rates starting at $17.75 per month.</p>
