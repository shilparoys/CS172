   <section id="content-main" class="page-curl"> 
    <p>The University of Southern California’s University Park Campus, located in the heart of Los Angeles, welcomes thousands of guests and visitors each year. The 229-acre campus just south of downtown is home to the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School, and most of USC’s professional schools. </p> 
    <p>USC strives to maintain a safe community for its students, faculty, staff, guests and neighbors. A new campus access policy was announced in November 2012 and takes effect on the University Park Campus Jan. 14, 2013.</p> 
    <p>From 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. every night, the number of entrances to campus will be limited; security personnel will be stationed at each entrance; and anyone coming to campus will be required to show identification. </p> 
    <p>The new system will require USC students, faculty and staff to register any guests arriving after 9 p.m. Guests will need to be registered and to present photo identification in order to enter campus. </p> 
    <p>Beginning Jan. 2, lightly used entrances to campus will close after business hours or at 9 p.m. Eight heavily used entrances will remain open at all times, including overnight. A map of entrances open after 9 p.m. is available on the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/maps/" target="_blank">USC Maps site </a>.</p> 
    <p><a href="./visitorreg/">Visitor registration </a> is available on this site. Once a USC student, staff or faculty registers a guest, the information is immediately available to entrance attendants. </p> 
    <h3> VISITORS:</h3> 
    <p>Pedestrians wishing to enter campus between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. must be registered as a guest and have a government issued identification card.</p> 
    <h3>VEHICLES:</h3> 
    <p>Cars with a USC parking permit will be admitted after 9 p.m. to campus parking structures. Registered guests will be allowed entry to parking structures after presenting their identification card to entrance attendants. A pass will be issued for registered guests. Unregistered guests will not be allowed entry unless they have a business purpose: examples include commercial food delivery, commercial transportation such as a shuttle van or taxi service, or service calls. Drivers will be asked for identification and for their destination. </p> 
    <h3>SPECIAL EVENTS:</h3> 
    <p>When a university department invites a large number of off-campus guests who will arrive between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., arrangements must be made through the USC Department of Public Safety. Guest passes will be created in conjunction with the host department. Student-organized events must be pre-approved and guest arrangements made through USC Student Affairs.</p> 
    <h3>VENDORS:</h3> 
    <p>USC Transportation will issue special passes to regular vendors.</p> 
    <p>These measures build on the extensive safety improvement efforts USC has undertaken over the past several years that have significantly improved the security of the University Park neighborhood, including adding officers, security ambassadors and cameras.</p> 
    <p>Most campus visits take place during daytime and early evening hours, and will be unaffected by the new policy. University officials are discussing options for providing convenient access to campus for extended members of the Trojan Family, such as neighbors participating in the university’s many outreach programs.</p>
