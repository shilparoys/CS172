To accomplish this, UCF has identified four distinct categories of designated personnel who may be needed to perform duties on campus during an interruption in normal operations: First Responders, Critical Personnel, Essential Personnel, and Continuity Personnel. Designated personnel must complete training, maintain personal emergency plans, and are required to report to work when notified. Faculty, staff, and contracted employees not designated in these categories are expected to listen to and comply with requests from designated personnel and should not report to campus during emergencies unless authorized or notified.
