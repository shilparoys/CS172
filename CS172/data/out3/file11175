      <p>At Drew, we take a holistic approach to reviewing your application and consider many factors in our decision, including your high school grades, course of study, recommendations, essay, extracurricular involvement and SAT/ACT scores. You also have the option of supplementing your application with an optional graded analytical paper which can serve to provide additional insight to your academic strengths.</p> 
      <h3>Application Types<a name="earlydecision"></a></h3> 
      <p>There are two ways to apply to Drew: <a title="Early Decision" href="#earlydecision">Early Decision</a> &amp; <a href="#regularadmission">Regular Admission</a>.</p> 
      <h4>Early Decision</h4> 
      <p>Early Decision is a special program designed for students who are confident that Drew is their first-choice school. Students should only apply Early Decision to one institution. Early Decision is binding, which means as part of applying Early Decision, you are agreeing that if you are admitted you will enroll at Drew University, financial circumstances permitting. Students must also submit the <a href="http://www.drew.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/106/EarlyDecisionAgreement.pdf">Early Decision Agreement</a> to be considered for Early Decision. If you are not admitted under the Early Decision program your application may be deferred to the regular decision pool, in which case your admission will not be binding.</p> 
      <p><strong>Why choose Early Decision? </strong></p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>The $60 application fee is automatically waived for Early Decision applicants</li> 
       <li>Early Decision applicants are given special consideration in the admission process</li> 
       <li>Early Decision students are among the first students to be considered for admission and <a href="http://www.drew.edu/financialassistance/grants-scholarships">scholarships</a></li> 
       <li><a name="regularadmission"></a>Early Decision is the fastest way to receive notification of your admission status</li> 
       <li>Early Decision allows you to finalize your college search process sooner</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p><strong>Drew has two Early Decision deadlines you may consider:</strong></p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Early Decision I – Deadline December 1, 2014.<br> <em>ED I Applicants whose applications are complete by the deadline will receive admissions decisions and financial aid information on or about December 16, 2014.</em></li> 
       <li>Early Decision II – Deadline February 2, 2015<br> <em>ED II Applicants whose applications are complete by or prior to the deadline will receive admissions decisions on a rolling basis beginning on or about January 7, 2015.</em></li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>Please note: Early Decision I applicants who do not have a completed application on file by December 1 will automatically be rolled to Early Decision II. Applicants for Early Decision II whose applications are not complete by February 2, 2015 will be considered for Regular Admission once all supporting documentation has been submitted.</p> 
      <h4><a name="sat"></a>Regular Admission</h4> 
      <p>Regular Admission allows you to apply at any point in the process. Primary consideration will be given to those applicants whose application and all supporting materials are received by February 16, 2015. Applications received or completed after this date will be considered on a rolling and space-permitting basis.</p> 
      <h4>Special &amp; Dual Degree Admissions Programs for First-Year Students</h4> 
      <p>At Drew we offer a number of <a href="http://www.drew.edu/undergraduate/admissions/applying#special">special admissions programs</a> that you may find to be a great fit for you. All of these programs are designed to ensure students excel while attending Drew and beyond.</p> 
      <h4>International Applicants</h4> 
      <p>Are you an International student who will require a visa to study in the United States? If so, be sure to review the <a href="http://www.drew.edu/undergraduate/admissions/applying/international-students">additional information for international students</a>.</p> 
      <h3>Financial Aid And Scholarships</h3> 
      <p>Drew is quite generous with financial aid and provides over $30 million to its students in financial aid each year. Both domestic and international students can qualify for <a href="http://www.drew.edu/financialassistance/grants-scholarships/college#DrewMeritBasedScholarships" title="merit-based scholarships">merit-based scholarships</a>, which are based on previous academic achievement. These scholarships do not require any additional application. Students are automatically considered for a scholarship at the point of admission.</p> 
      <p>In addition to these merit scholarships, first-year students may also apply for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.drew.edu/financialassistance/grants-scholarships/college#CivicEngagementScholarships" title="Civic Engagement Scholarship">Civic Engagement Scholarship</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.drew.edu/financialassistance/grants-scholarships/college#RISEScienceScholarships" title="Rise Science Scholarship">RISE Science Scholarship</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.drew.edu/financialassistance/grants-scholarships/college#PresidentialScholarshipintheArts" title="Presidential Scholarship in the Arts">Presidential Scholarship in the Arts</a>. These scholarships provide $20,000 ($5,000 per year) to recipients. These scholarships all require a special application and have a March 1 application deadline.</p>

      <h3><a name="eos"></a>Educational Opportunity Scholars (EOS/EOF)</h3> 
      <p>The Educational Opportunity Scholars program is a partnership between the New Jersey Commission of Higher Education and Drew University. Within this partnership, the program provides access to higher education and support for highly motivated students who exhibit the potential for success, but come from families of low income and lack access to the quality educational preparation necessary to attend college. The program provides direct services designed to promote persistence through degree completion. Furthermore, the program supports innovative educational initiatives, support services and leadership development activities to enhance the student’s chance for academic success.</p> 
      <h4>To be considered for the EOS/EOF program, you must:</h4> 
      <ol> 
       <li>demonstrate financial need and a background of historical poverty,</li> 
       <li>have a family income that falls within the established income eligibility criteria,</li> 
       <li>demonstrate an educationally disadvantaged background, and</li> 
       <li>be a U.S. citizen and a resident of New Jersey for 12 months immediately preceding enrollment.</li> 
      </ol> 
      <p>Students enrolled in the EOS/EOF program receive additional grants from the state of New Jersey. In addition, Drew University provides significant additional need-based aid to support EOS students. Students also attend a free summer enrichment program to prepare for success in college and receive extra support services throughout their studies, such as counseling and tutoring. For more information, <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/highereducation/EOF/EOF_Description.shtml" target="_blank">visit the EOF site</a>.</p>
