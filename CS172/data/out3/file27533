       </ul> 
       <p></p> 
       <p> <b>B. Dependency Status Information:</b> <br> Dependency status questions on the FAFSA determine whether your parents' information needs to be included on the FAFSA. <br> The following are the current dependency status questions: </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Were you born before January 1, 1992?</li> 
        <li>Are you married?</li>

        <li>Are you a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces?</li> 
        <li>Do you now have or will you have children who will receive more than half of their support from you between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016?</li>

        <li>At any time on or after July 1, 2014, did the director of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless or were self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?</li> 
        <li>At any time on or after July 1, 2014, did the director of a runaway or homeless youth basic center or transitional living program determine that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless or were self-supporting and at risk of being homeless?</li> 
       </ul>

       </ul>

       <p style="margin-bottom: 0"> <b>F. Signing and Submission: </b><br> You are required to sign your <em>FAFSA on the Web</em> application.

       <p>Federal Student Aid Information Center, P.O. Box 84, Washington, D.C. 20044</p> 
       <p> <b>J. Links to Other Sites:</b> <br> Our policy discloses the privacy practices for <em>FAFSA on the Web</em>. The Department is not responsible for information you provide when you link to any non-Department of Education Web sites. </p> 
       <b>2. Why is this information being collected?</b>
       <br> Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended we are allowed to ask for the information on this form so that we can determine whether you are eligible for aid, and, if so, how much. Application information submitted on 
       <em>FAFSA on the Web</em> is collected from you, as the student, your parents, and financial aid administrators to determine your EFC (used to establish your eligibility for federal, state, and institutional student aid), to identify the schools to which your processed record is to be sent; and to collect your certification that the information is correct and that you agree to comply with federal regulations. See #1 above to identify the specific data elements used for each purpose. 
       <br> 
       <br> 
       <b>3. Am I required to provide all of the information requested?</b>  
       <br> Providing information is voluntary; however, if you do not give us all of the information we need to process your FAFSA, your aid may be delayed or denied. If you want federal student aid only, you do not have to answer certain questions. See 
       <a href="JavaScript:Help('ffpriv08.htm', 'en_US');">Questions You Don't Have to Answer</a> for more information. Of course, if you want to apply for state financial aid, you must answer all the relevant questions. 
       <br> 
       <br> 
       <b>4. How will FSA use this information?</b>  
       <br> Information in this system will be used by Federal Student Aid to create a unique record, determine your dependency status, calculate your EFC, identify the schools to which the processed record is to be sent, and collect your certification that the information is correct and that you agree to comply with federal regulations. See #1 above to identify the specific data elements used for each purpose. 
       <br> 
       <br> 
       <div id="alpha">

       <b>6. Describe the notice or opportunities for consent that would be or are provided to individuals about what information is collected and how that information is shared with other organizations:</b> 
       <p> A Privacy Act Statement is incorporated into the <em>FAFSA on the Web</em> Privacy Policy articulating the specific authority for collecting personal information that will be maintained and retrieved by name or identifier from a Privacy Act system of records, the mandatory or voluntary nature of the information collected and the uses of the information.

       <p>As a government agency Web site accessed by students, parents, and financial aid administrators, this Privacy Policy is appropriately posted for all Web site users. This is a general policy, which applies to the handling of any information collected at the site. The policy highlights the voluntary nature of information collected, and explains which data elements are necessary in order to fully consider an application. The notice advises that if a student does not provide all of the information needed to process the student's FAFSA, federal student aid may be delayed or denied. Users are notified that providing the information constitutes consent to all of its uses, and they are given no option affirmatively to consent to certain limited uses. In addition, the policy notifies customers about the automatic recording and potential uses of any non-personal information about a visit (i.e., site management data).</p> 
       <b>7. How will the information be secured?</b>

The Web site's System Security Plan and Configuration Management Plan demonstrating its compliance with the Information Technology requirements mandated by federal law and policy are included in ED's Central Processing System (CPS) security plan. The security plan contains details regarding the Risk Assessment conducted for the Web site, as well as the security controls (hardware/software/facilities/personnel) in place to mitigate any identified risks to the information collected on the Web site. Management, operational, and technical security controls are in place for the Web site, encompassing personnel, physical environment access, contingency plans, disaster recovery, and identification and authentication procedures. The Web site is currently in the operations/maintenance phase of the life cycle. As such, the following functions are being performed: security operations and administration, operational assurance, audits and monitoring. There is a System Security Officer (SSO) for the Web site.
