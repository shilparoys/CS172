        <p><b>The Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) program</b> at Green River Community College awards an Associate in Applied Science degree and is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education. Students are prepared for employment as PTAs in a variety of physical therapy practice settings. Upon completion of the program graduates are eligible to apply for licensure and sit for the licensing examination. </p> 
        <p>Physical Therapist Assistants, under the supervision of Physical Therapists, utilize therapeutic exercise, functional training, adaptive devices (including prosthetics), and physical agents (water, electricity, sound, light, heat and cold) to restore, maintain, and promote optimal physical function. They work with a diverse range of individuals who have physical limitations or disabilities resulting from injury, disease, or surgery. </p> 
        <p>The PTA degree includes related instruction requirements in anatomy and physiology, communication, English composition and math. These may be completed at any accredited college or university. Program studies include coursework specific to physical therapy theory, skills and behavior as well as practical clinical experiences in area health care facilities. PTA courses must be taken in sequence.</p> 
        <!--<p><b>Due to the high volume of PTA applications for 2010, we are <u>NOT</u> accepting late applications.</b></p>-->

            <p>PTAs are employed in a wide variety of settings including hospitals and rehabilitation facilities; outpatient clinics and offices; skilled nursing, extended care or convalescent facilities; home health agencies; hospices; schools and other pediatric facilities; sports therapy clinics and athletic facilities. </p> 
            <p>The demand for physical therapist assistants is strong in the Puget Sound area and nationwide. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 44 percent increase in the need for PTAs this decade. In the Seattle-Tacoma area the average pay range is $18-24 per hour, plus benefits.</p> 
            <p>All of Green River&#x2019;s PTA program graduates who have sought employment in physical therapy have been employed. Many students have obtained jobs prior to graduation. </p> 
            <p>Essentially 100% of program graduates are consistently employed within 6 months of passing the licensure examination. This has been true since 2008 when licensure was first required in Washington State. Many students have job offers prior to graduation. The college maintains a web-based job board that is accessible to all graduates and includes positions appropriate for PTAs. Additionally, the college hosts a health careers job fair each January or February</p>

CAPTE will consider two types of complaints: those that involve situations subject to institutional due process policies and procedures and those that involve situations not subject to due process procedures:</p>
