            </header> 
            <p>The Business Studies major comprises a set of introductory courses, a set of core courses, a choice of electives drawn from Business, Society and Culture and economics courses, and a capstone that integrates concepts students have been exposed to in the major. The introductory and core courses include five economics courses so that majors will have a thorough understanding of the operation of markets and the economy, with special attention to financial markets. Accounting and statistics round out the introductory courses. The other core courses include key business courses in ethics, history and management. There are four required electives for the major; students must select two courses from the current Business, Society and Culture offerings, and two courses from Economics electives.</p>
            <p>Finally, a one-credit capstone course is designed to pull together previous work that students have done in prior courses, and will have students present their research to each other and faculty members throughout the term.</p>

                <p>In this course students learn about the relationships between systems of production and distribution and the social and cultural contexts in which they occur. After discussing some important theoretical approaches that have influenced economic anthropologists over the years, we consider various ethnographic case studies that provide a more nuanced understanding of both the material and symbolic aspects of economic processes. Throughout the course, we pay close attention to the ways in which global economic processes are articulated, and made meaningful, at the local level. We also contemplate the relationships between global capitalism and pressing social problems, including hunger, gender inequities, poverty, war, and environmental degradation.</p>

                <p>This course relies heavily on a foundation of "experiential learning." The lecture portion of the class focuses on how technology is integrated into business solutions, with review and discussion of case studies using current topics like the healthcare.gov website design and development problems, the state-of-the-art logistics considerations for Amazon.com, and the technology considerations for broadcasting a Super Bowl at Met-Life Stadium in New Jersey. The concepts covered during these lectures are then integrated into the project work that teams of students will complete as they review specific areas of business on Drew's campus, and report back to the class on everything from how hardware/software solutions were defined, developed, purchased, implemented, supported and even retired.</p>

               <p>In this course students learn about the relationships between systems of production and distribution and the social and cultural contexts in which they occur. After discussing some important theoretical approaches that have influenced economic anthropologists over the years, we consider various ethnographic case studies that provide a more nuanced understanding of both the material and symbolic aspects of economic processes. Throughout the course, we pay close attention to the ways in which global economic processes are articulated, and made meaningful, at the local level. We also contemplate the relationships between global capitalism and pressing social problems, including hunger, gender inequities, poverty, war, and environmental degradation.</p>

               <p>This course relies heavily on a foundation of "experiential learning." The lecture portion of the class focuses on how technology is integrated into business solutions, with review and discussion of case studies using current topics like the healthcare.gov website design and development problems, the state-of-the-art logistics considerations for Amazon.com, and the technology considerations for broadcasting a Super Bowl at Met-Life Stadium in New Jersey. The concepts covered during these lectures are then integrated into the project work that teams of students will complete as they review specific areas of business on Drew's campus, and report back to the class on everything from how hardware/software solutions were defined, developed, purchased, implemented, supported and even retired.</p>

In other words, Market Structure &amp; Marketing is about how organizations give, receive and interpret communications with all the different individuals and organizations that it needs to work with to do what it does.
