        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> 
        <h3>Why should we join CyLon?</h3> 
        <p>As Europe’s first cyber-security accelerator programme, CyLon offers a unique and outstanding opportunity to work with an accomplished network of mentors and investors.</p> 
        <p>CyLon was founded by some of the UK’s leading technology investors and consultants, including Eileen Burbidge (Passion Capital), Alex van Someren (Amadeus Capital Partners) and Epsilon Advisory, and is operated by Ignite, the UK’s leading seed accelerator programme. </p> 
        <h3>How much funding do businesses attending CyLon receive?</h3> 
        <p>Teams receive a £5,000 stipend per founder in return for their full-time attendance on the programme. This is intended to assist with living costs for teams, and is limited to a maximum of £15,000 per team. To be clear, this is a stipend and there are no other costs OR equity associated with participating in the programme.</p> 
        <h3>How much equity will CyLon take in my business?</h3> 
        <p>Zero equity. Due to the unique way we’re funded, CyLon will not ask teams for an equity stake in their business.</p> 
        <h3>How is CyLon funded?</h3> 
        <p>The programme is funded entirely through corporate sponsorship. These sponsors are commercial partners only and have no say in the operation of your business, no prescriptive rights or unique access to the technology you create. There are no strange terms and conditions and we align ourselves entirely with the other founders of the business.</p> 
        <h3>What else will CyLon provide?</h3> 
        <p>Aside from your team receive everything you might expect from a full time accelerator programme including a full schedule of mentoring, coaching, workshops and field trips over the 13 weeks period, you’ll also receive free workspace for an additional 13 weeks after the programme ends at our state-of-the-art offices. </p> 
        <h3>Does CyLon have a seed fund for teams after the programme?</h3> 
        <p>There is no official CyLon follow-on fund, however the founders of Cylon will consider teams on the programmes for additional investment, as well as introducing founders to their own angel and VC networks. Two founders of CyLon are venture capital investors, and have specific funds earmarked to invest companies they select during or after the programme.</p> 
        <p>In short, it’s expected successful teams will have access to follow-on seed funding to ensure they continue to grow and scale.</p> 
        <h3>What type of startups do you accept?</h3> 
        <p>CyLon aims to assist founders in building commercial businesses that deliver outstanding information security technology.</p> 
        <p>Cyber-security has become central to a successful economy in the 21st century, so we’ll consider teams applying themselves in any one of a number of industries; from defence to retail, telecoms to financial services, digital industries to health services.</p> 
        <h3>Is my startup too early (or late) stage to apply to CyLon?</h3> 
        <p>Not at all. We’ll consider startups that are still at the concept stage, though we can provide substantial value to later-stage businesses too.</p> 
        <p>We anticipate that with no equity being taken and access to our awesome network of mentors and partners that the programme will also appeal to funded cyber companies.</p> 
        <h3>Can I apply if I’m not from the UK?</h3> 
        <p>For this programme, CyLon will consider startups from the UK and within the EU, as long as you and your team can legally work in the UK for the duration of the programme.</p> 
        <h3>Where is CyLon based?</h3> 
        <p>Our state-of-the-art offices are based at Winton Capital in Hammersmith, next to the tube station - 15 minutes via tube from Victoria and 20 minutes from King’s Cross St Pancras.</p> 
        <h3>When is the deadline to apply and what’s the overall timeline?</h3> 
        <p>Applications open on Friday 16th January and close at 9am on Monday 2nd March. Following a series of interviews with the CyLon team, finalists will be offered a place on the programme by Friday 20th March at the latest. The programme is due to start on Monday 20th April and close on Friday 10th July.</p> 
        <h3>Do I need to send in a business plan?</h3> 
        <p>Our aim is to help you shape your business and identify commercial opportunities; even if you’re trading and have revenues, your business and product are likely to change. For these reasons, we don’t require a business plan at this stage. Instead, complete the short application form, but please make sure you fill in all the questions.</p> 
        <h3>Where will we live during the programme?</h3> 
        <p>If you currently live outside London, finding a place to stay is your responsibility, however we’ll assist you where we can to find accommodation.</p> 
        <h3>Will you accept single founder teams? What about non-developers?</h3> 
        <p>The CyLon programme is very intensive, and for that reason we would prefer teams over single founders. That doesn’t mean we won’t consider single founders, but they must be outstanding developers and have strong product development skills. </p> 
        <p>All teams should have the ability to iterate while part of the programme and therefore must be able to build the core technology themselves.</p>

      <p>Digital technology touches virtually every aspect of daily life today. Social interaction, healthcare activity, political engagement or economic decision-making – digital connectivity permeates it all, and the dependence on this connectivity is growing swiftly.</p> 
      <p>Greater reliance on a networked resource naturally makes us more interdependent on one another. The collective ability to manage risks in this shared digital environment is fundamental. It forms the crux of cyber-resilience.</p>
