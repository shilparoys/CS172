        <li><h3 id="methodology">What methodology is used to calculate StatCounter Global Stats? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('methodology')" href="faq#methodology">#</a></h3> <p><a href="http://statcounter.com">StatCounter</a> is a web analytics service. Our tracking code is installed on more than 3 million sites globally. These sites cover various activities and <a href="faq#sample-size" onclick="highlight('sample-size')">geographic locations</a>. Every month, we record billions of page views to these sites. For each page view, we analyse the browser/operating system/screen resolution used and we establish if the page view is from a mobile device. For our search engine stats, we analyze every page view referred by a search engine. For our social media stats, we analyze every page view referred by a social media site. We summarize all this data to get our Global Stats information.</p> <p>We provide independent, unbiased stats on internet usage trends. We do not collate our stats with any other information sources. <a href="faq#no-weighting" onclick="highlight('no-weighting')">No artificial weightings are used</a>. We remove <a href="faq#bots" onclick="highlight('bots')">bot activity</a> and make a small adjustment to our browser stats for <a href="faq#prerendering" onclick="highlight('prerendering')">prerendering in Google Chrome</a>. Aside from those adjustments, we publish the data as we record it.</p> <p>In other words we calculate our Global Stats on the basis of more than 15 billion page views per month, by people from all over the world onto our 3 million+ member sites.</p> <p>By collating our data in this way, we track the activity of third party visitors to our member websites. We do not calculate our stats based on the activity of our members alone. This helps to minimise bias in the data and achieve a random sample.</p> <p>In June 2013, our global sample consisted of 17.5 billion page views (US: 4.2 billion); 2.1 billion of these were search engine referrals (US: 370 million); 328 million of these were social media referrals (US: 117 million). </p> </li>

Both types of graph offer equally correct/robust information.</p> <p>A bar graph is discrete and shows total figures. A line graph is continuous and shows trends over time. The different types of graphs are appropriate in different situations. Comparing ONE randomly selected reading from the line graph (where multiple readings are available) with the single corresponding figure from the bar graph is not a correct or appropriate comparison.</p> <p>Trend graphs show multiple entries over time whereas bar graphs show totals. These are standard, universally accepted conventions.</p> </li>

All services differ. For example:</p> 
         <ul>
          <li>Some services base stats on sales/downloads - we don't - we measure internet usage.</li> 
          <li>Some services collect data via opt-in toolbars - <a href="faq#toolbar" onclick="highlight('toolbar')">we don't</a> - our stats are based on the anonymous third parties who visit our member websites.</li> 
          <li>Our stats are based on over 15 billion page views per month to over 3 million global websites - we are not aware of any other publicly available service providing market share stats that has a bigger <a href="faq#sample-size" onclick="highlight('sample-size')">sample size</a> on which they base their information. </li> 
          <li>We base our stats on page views (and not unique visitors)- <a href="faq#page-views-uniques" onclick="highlight('page-views-uniques')">we feel that this gives the fairest approximation of internet usage</a>.</li>

        <li><h3 id="net-apps">Why are your numbers different to Net Applications? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('net-apps')" href="faq#net-apps">#</a></h3> <p>There are a number of differences between StatCounter Global Stats and Net Apps. These include:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><strong>Sample Size</strong><br> StatCounter Global Stats are based on a pool of 3 million+ global websites. Net Apps state that their stats are currently based on over 40,000 websites. (<i>"We collect data from the browsers of site visitors to our exclusive on-demand network of ... over 40,000 websites"</i>)</li> 
          <li><strong>Page Views Tracked</strong><br> We track over 15 billion page views per month across our network of member sites. Nets Apps do not publish the number of page views they track. </li> 
          <li><strong>Page Views versus Uniques</strong><br> Net Apps base their stats on unique visitors per site per day. (<i>"We 'count' unique visitors to our network sites, and only count one unique visit to each network site per day."</i>) We base our stats on page views - <a href="faq#page-views-uniques" onclick="highlight('page-views-uniques')">here's why</a>.</li> 
          <li><strong>Weighted Data</strong><br> Net Apps apply weighting factors to their data in respect of their worldwide stats. (<i>"The Net Market Share data is weighted by country."</i>) We don't and <a href="faq#no-weighting" onclick="highlight('no-weighting')">here's why</a>. Please note that if country weighting is used, it should only be applied to worldwide, continental or similar data where stats for several countries are grouped together. Weighting factors are <u>not</u> relevant for individual country stats. </li> 
          <li><strong>Free versus Paid</strong><br> Currently all StatCounter Global Stats data and graphs are available free of charge. Net Apps provide some information for free but require paid upgrades to access regional and other data.</li> 
          <li><strong>Publication of Sample Sizes</strong><br> We publish our <a href="faq#sample-size" onclick="highlight('sample-size')">individual country sample sizes here</a>. Net Apps do not appear to provide this information. We encourage them to do so to allow a clear comparison of our services. </li> 
          <li><strong>Javascript versus Non-Javascript</strong><br> To the best of our knowledge, Net Apps only tracks javascript enabled browsers. We track both javascript and non-javascript browsers. This is particularly important in the mobile space.</li> 
          <li><strong>Browser stats - IE Bundled with other browsers</strong><br> Net Apps state that they bundle IE with other unrelated browsers. (<i>"Internet Explorer usage share includes third party browsers such as Maxthon and Lunascape with Trident rendering engine"</i>) We don't. We separately track and report IE, Maxthon and Lunascape.</li> 
          <li><strong>Browser stats - Prerendering</strong><br> In Feb 2012, Net Apps introduced an adjustment to their stats to take account of prerendering behavior in the Chrome browser. We introduced an adjustment for prerendering on 01 May 2012 - <a href="faq#prerendering" onclick="highlight('prerendering')">read more here</a>.</li> 
         </ul> <p>Please note that we are not connected with Net Apps but due to many recent queries about the comparison of our services, we have published this FAQ. Please also bear in mind that we have never used Net Apps stats and we don't have access to their paid services however, for the purposes of this entry, we've reviewed their FAQs and we've also picked up some information from our users and from online articles. In the interests of fairness and balance, we suggest you confirm all the above with Net Apps directly (and please do let us know if we need to update this FAQ!).</p> <p>No stats service (even our own!) is perfect and it's up to users to decide which service suits their needs. That's why we try to make our service/methodology/stats as transparent as we can. If you have any information to update/correct/expand the above FAQ, please do <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/feedback">let us know ASAP</a>. </p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="no-weighting">Why do you not weight your data? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('no-weighting')" href="faq#no-weighting">#</a></h3> <p>We do not impose artificial weightings on our stats - this is a conscious and deliberate decision. Weighting stats means that the stats are only as good as the weighting methodology used. If the weighting data is inaccurate or out of date, then it renders the data completely incorrect. Further, applying a weighting factor to inaccurate data does not turn it into meaningful information - no matter what weighting factors are applied, the geographical spread of the initial stats is very important. For these reasons, we choose not to weight our data.</p> <p>We would also have a significant difficulty in choosing and applying any system of weights to our data. For example, how would we handle changes in the weights? Would we rerun and restate all our prior stats? Would we apply a smoothing factor? How often would we update the weights?</p> <p>By publishing our data without any adjustment for country weighting, we allow our users to re-run the numbers using any weighting system they wish. No weighting system is imposed on them and they are free to take our data and weight it however they wish or not at all. The decision is theirs. All our work is shared under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License</a> to facilitate our users with this.</p> <p>Important!</p> <p>Please note that if country weighting is used, it should only be applied to worldwide, continental or similar data where stats for several countries are aggregated. Weighting factors are <u>not</u> relevant for individual country stats.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="cia-data-weighting">You don't weight your data using the CIA Internet Users data - why not? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('cia-data-weighting')" href="faq#cia-data-weighting">#</a></h3> <p>We do not weight any of our data. Our users are, of course, welcome to apply weights to the data (or not at all) if they wish. Weighting is not relevant for individual country stats. <a href="faq#no-weighting" onclick="highlight('no-weighting')">Read more about our decision not to weight our stats here</a>.</p> <p>With specific reference to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html">CIA Internet Users data</a>, some of the difficulties include:</p> 
         <ul>
          <li>The data is collected at different times and may be out of date. For example, in March 2012, the CIA data per country is based on figures from 2001, 2008 and 2009 for different countries.</li> 
          <li>The data is vague and inconsistent - "<i>This entry gives the number of users within a country that access the Internet. Statistics vary from country to country and may include users who access the Internet at least several times a week to those who access it only once within a period of several months.</i>" In other words, users who access the internet several times per day are given equal weight as those who only visit an internet café once per month - this seems to be inherently problematic.</li> 
          <li>No distinction is made between mobile and non-mobile users. It would not, therefore, be correct to weight browser stats using the CIA data. In China, for example, <a href="http://www.chinainternetwatch.com/whitepaper/china-internet-statistics/">some estimates put mobile internet usage as high as 66%</a>. Weighting browser stats without adjusting for potentially significant Chinese mobile internet usage would incorrectly inflate the stats for desktop browsers. This could significantly overstate the stats for <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-CN-monthly-201104-201204-bar">desktop browsers which are popular in China</a>. Similar problems would be encountered in other countries with high mobile internet usage. </li>
         </ul> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="page-views-uniques">Why do you base your stats on page views rather than unique visitors? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('page-views-uniques')" href="faq#page-views-uniques">#</a></h3> <p> We measure internet usage trends. To accurately measure usage, we have to base our stats on page views (and not unique visitors). Let's look at an example:</p> <p>Person X uses two browsers. On a particular day, they load one page in Browser A. They load 500 pages in Browser B.</p> <p>If we based our stats on unique visitors then usage of Browser A and B would both be recorded as 50%. This is obviously incorrect. This does <u>not</u> fairly represent the usage of the browsers given that Browser B was used 500 times more than browser A.</p> <p>Using page views as the basis of our stats means that Browser A will be recorded at less than 1% in our stats whereas Browser B will be recorded at over 99%. In our view, this gives a more accurate representation of actual browser usage.</p> <p>Furthermore, there are many limitations, difficulties and uncertainties with regard to unique visitors.</p> <p><i>Do you define a unique visitor based on cookies? How do you handle browsers which don't allow cookies? In this case, each page view is counted as a unique. Or do you use IP address? How do you handle dynamic IPs (such as AOL) where the IP changes with every page view? In this case, each page view is again counted as a unique.</i></p> <p>There are also difficulties with deciding how often/when to include the stats for a particular unique visitor.</p> <p><i>What is the return period for a unique visitor? Do you reset the counters after 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours? Do you count each time a unique visitor visits any site in your network? Or do you only count one unique visit to any site in the network per day? What if the same person uses multiple browsers? </i></p> <p>Due to the above uncertainties, <u>no</u> service can provide stats based solely on unique visitors. Instead, the stats will be based on a mixture of page views and uniques. We made a conscious decision not to introduce that inconsistency into our figures hence our use of page views as the basis of our stats.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="javascript-enabled">Are your stats based on javascript enabled browsers only? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('javascript-enabled')" href="faq#javascript-enabled">#</a></h3> <p>No. We track both javascript and non-javascript enabled browsers - this is critical in the mobile space but less so in relation to the desktop market.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="stat-variation">The stats for my site are completely different to StatCounter Global Stats - why? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('stat-variation')" href="faq#stat-variation">#</a></h3> <p>There are two difficulties with trying to use the stats for a single website to calculate market share information:</p> 
         <ol> 
          <li>The sample size is generally very small i.e. only the visitors to that one website</li> 
          <li>The user stats for a single website can be skewed due to the type of person who visits that site. For example, all visitors may be in a certain age group or may have a particular interest area. This can influence the use or otherwise of a mobile device and also influence the browser/operating system/search engine/social media site used.</li> 
         </ol> <p>The StatCounter Global Stats analysis is based on over 15 billion page views per month, by a random sample of people worldwide, to more than 3 million global websites, covering multiple interest areas and geographic locations.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="discontinuity">I have noticed a problem/discontinuity in the Global Stats data. <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('discontinuity')" href="faq#discontinuity">#</a></h3> <p>At StatCounter we track over 15 billion page views per month on the StatCounter network of more than 3 million websites. We publish a summary of the activity that we track via StatCounter Global Stats.</p> <p>In the case of some countries/regions (e.g. Antarctica) the sample size of page views may not be sufficiently large to be statistically robust. In this case, it is possible that there may be some bias in the data and the graphs may become skewed by a small number of users.</p> <p>If you remain concerned, please <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/feedback">contact us</a> and we will investigate and respond as soon as possible.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="detect">Is there a way to check if the StatCounter Global Stats detection is correct? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('detect')" href="faq#detect">#</a></h3> <p>Absolutely.

Here is some information to review:</p> 
         <ul>
          <li>In terms of sample size, StatCounter Global Stats are based on an analysis of more than 15 billion page views on more than 3 million websites per month. We are not aware of any other publicly available service providing market share stats that has a bigger sample size on which they base their information. </li> 
          <li>We also have a wide global spread of stats and we make our <a href="faq#sample-size" onclick="highlight('sample-size')">individual country sample sizes publicly available</a>.</li> 
          <li>Many other providers use an artificial weighting system for their stats - obviously, this can have a significant impact on their numbers and any change in the weighting system can have a corresponding impact on the numbers they report. <a href="faq#no-weighting" onclick="highlight('no-weighting')">We don't use any artificial weights</a> - instead our users can apply their chosen weights if they wish. </li> 
          <li>From time to time, changes or revisions to our stats may be necessary. We reserve a 45 day window to revise stats. Outside of this, no stats will be restated. Where any revision or significant change is made to our stats, we flag this by way of a note on our graphs.</li> 
         </ul> <p> Please <a href="feedback">contact us</a> if you have any further questions.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="bots">Do bots influence your stats? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('bots')" href="faq#bots">#</a></h3> <p>We make every effort to eliminate bot activity. We identify bots and prevent them from being recorded in our stats. We also monitor multiple key metrics in order to identify any potential problems with our data. We maintain communications with many of the main technology providers and we reserve a 45 day window to revise stats if/when necessary. In the event of a change or revision being required we flag this on our graphs by way of a note.</p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="origin">How did StatCounter Global Stats come about? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('origin')" href="faq#origin">#</a></h3> <p>StatCounter Global Stats came about because we decided to publicly share interesting trends that we were monitoring in-house. We literally had a light bulb moment one day when we realised that other people might be interested in these Global Stats too... so we made an interface and published all the stats for free.</p> <p>Our methodology is very simple and we've purposefully kept it that way - we try to make our Global stats as clear and transparent as possible and we appreciate all user queries, comments and suggestions.

From 1 May 2012, prerendered pages (which are not actually viewed) are not included in our stats. </p> <p>Some points to note:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li>Prerendering was <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2011/06/prerendering-in-chrome.html">announced by Chrome</a> in June 2011. This change did not have any significant <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201102-201202">impact on our stats</a>.</li> 
          <li>Chrome is currently allowing the detection of prerendering behavior via its <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/whitepapers/pagevisibility.html">Page Visibility API</a>. </li> 
          <li>Google specifically states:<br> <i>"<strong>Important</strong>: This is an experimental API and may change-or even be removed-in the future, especially as the Page Visibility API standard, which is an early draft, evolves."</i><br> This means that in the future it may not be possible to track/remove the effect of prerendering on Chrome.</li> 
          <li>If other browsers adopt prerendering then it may not be possible to track/remove the effect of prerendering on those browsers. In that case, the fairest solution would be to include all page views (prerendered or not) for all browsers rather than only excluding prerendering in Chrome. That scenario would require us to revisit this methodology change in the future.</li> 
          <li>We publish a graph showing total <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#prerender-ww-daily-20120501-20120522">prerendered page views</a> tracked in Chrome, together with the portion of prerendered pages which are not actually viewed by the end user. The prerendered pages (which are not actually viewed) are removed from our stats. For May 2012, the percentage of prerendered pages (not viewed) in Chrome is approximately 1.3%. Note that this change has not had any significant impact on our <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201201-201205">browser stats</a>. This is due to our use of <a href="faq#page-views-uniques" onclick="highlight('page-views-uniques')">page views</a> to track browser usage - page views are less susceptible to influence by prerendering than unique visitors.</li> 
         </ul> <p><strong>Safari &amp; Opera</strong></p> <p>The "Top Sites" feature in Safari and the "Speed dial" feature in Opera's desktop browser show preview thumbnails of frequently visited or bookmarked sites. These preview thumbnails are refreshed by the respective browsers periodically. Unfortunately, it is not possible to exclude these previews from being tracked. To get a bit technical, this is because the "X-Purpose: preview" header is only sent with the request for the base page. The header is not sent as part of requests for images, CSS or JavaScript that have to be downloaded and executed as part of the preview. With online web analytics (as provided by StatCounter) the relevant header information is not passed so these preview requests can't be detected and therefore can't be removed. Ideally Safari and Opera will change this to ensure to send the "X-Purpose: preview" header with all "Top Sites" and "Speed Dial" HTTP requests, however this is not the case at present.</p> <p></p> </li> 
        <li><h3 id="ie-bundled">BROWSERS: Do you bundle IE with other browsers in your stats? <a class="headerlink" title="Permalink to this faq item" onclick="highlight('ie-bundled')" href="faq#ie-bundled">#</a></h3> <p>Certainly not!

This is because many third party twitter clients do not provide referral information. Referral stats were largely based, therefore, on referrals from twitter.com; referrals from many mobile/desktop twitter clients being unavailable.</p> <p>While Twitter had been testing its automatic link shortening service for some time, the new t.co feature was rolled out on a wide scale in August 2011. You can learn more about the t.co URL shortener <a href="http://support.twitter.com/entries/109623">here</a> and <a href="http://support.twitter.com/articles/78124-how-to-shorten-links-urls">here</a>.</p> <p>The use of this automatic link shortening now allows more accurate analysis of twitter referrals. In other words, referring links which were previously unavailable due to the use of third party twitter clients can now be successfully tracked.</p> <p>From 24 August, we have updated our detection and now include t.co links for twitter. In many regions this resulted in a significant jump for twitter on our Social Media stats graphs.</p> <p>It should be noted that it is possible for t.co links to be copied from twitter and pasted on to a blog or other website. In such a case, a t.co referral would be included as a twitter referral within our Global Stats despite the referral having come from a different website. This scenario indicates that Twitter referrals may now be slightly overstated, however, we expect such overstatement to be small.</p> </li>
