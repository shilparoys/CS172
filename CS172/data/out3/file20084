                   <p>A provisional chapter of Phi Theta Kappa is one which meets the same requirements as an active chapter except that the two-year college which sponsors the chapter is only provisionally accredited by educational authorities.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(1)</strong> Provisional chapter status results in the granting of a provisional charter; such a charter is in effect for five years.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(2)</strong> Transition to active status occurs when a provisional chapter becomes an active chapter at the time the two-year college sponsoring the chapter achieves full accreditation. At this time, the president and advisor of the provisional chapter should inform the National* Headquarters in writing, so that a new charter may be issued.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(3)</strong> A provisional charter may be extended for one year, in addition to the five years granted on the issuance of the provisional charter, upon petition of the president of the sponsoring school and the provisional chapter advisor. The petition must state that full accreditation is expected within the year and must document that assertion.</p> 
                   <p><strong>(4)</strong> No member of a provisional chapter may serve as a national* officer of Phi Theta Kappa. </p> 
                   <p><strong>(5)</strong> A provisional charter of Phi Theta Kappa expires after five years unless the provisional chapter becomes an active chapter. Upon the expiration of the provisional charter, the provisional charter will be removed from the rolls of the Society.</p>

                 <p><strong>Section 1. Eligibility.</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>A.</strong> As eligibility for membership is determined, a student's cumulative grade for all courses taken at the institution where the student is currently enrolled must be considered, as decreed by the institution's grade forgiveness policy. Grades for courses taken at another institution may be considered when determining membership eligibility. For students who were previously enrolled at the institution they are presently attending and who have not taken classes for a period of five consecutive years, studies taken more than five years ago need not be considered when determining membership eligibility, if the college administration so desires. In this case, no course taken more than five years ago shall be considered when determining the student's cumulative grade. Furthermore, the college administration shall have the prerogative of increasing the number of years which must elapse for waiving course consideration to any period beyond five years. At least twelve hours of work must be in courses leading to an associate degree in a fully accredited university, a four-year college or the two-year college in which the student is enrolled. Individuals presently incarcerated are not eligible for membership. An individual convicted of a felony (or any crime whose potential sentence is greater than one year) may be considered for membership three years following completion of all conditions of sentencing, including probation.</p> 
                  <p><strong>B.</strong> Individuals who attended a two-year college prior to the establishment of that college's chapter may be invited to membership by that local chapter. The individual must provide to the chapter advisor official documentation demonstrating that, at the time of enrollment in that two-year college, the individual satisfied the requirements for membership as set forth in Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution. These individuals pay international, regional and local fees prior to induction. Following initiation, these individuals immediately assume alumni status.</p> 
                  <p><strong>C.</strong> For purposes of determining membership eligibility, a grade of a "B" is interpreted to be a grade point average of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale or the equivalent rank of the top 20% of one's class, whichever is higher.</p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p><strong>Section 2. Term of Active Membership.</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>A.</strong> Active membership is terminated when a member is no longer enrolled in the two-year college.</p> 
                  <p><strong>B.</strong> For the purpose of holding international office in the Society, active membership in an active chapter is defined as being enrolled in an associate degree program exclusively in a two-year college. A Phi Theta Kappa member may be a candidate for international office only one time.</p>

                 <p><strong>Section 3. Good Standing.</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>To maintain active membership, a student shall maintain a cumulative grade-point average of not less than a "B." Otherwise, he has one term in which to bring his cumulative average up to a "B." If the member fails to do so, the chapter advisor shall notify the Executive Director and the member's name shall be removed from both the local and the international roll.</p>

                 <p><strong>Section 4. Induction.</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>Immediately after qualifying for membership, the candidate shall be notified in writing by the chapter secretary and invited to join the Society. The registrar of the college at this time shall certify the name of each accepting candidate to the Executive Director on the membership form supplied by the International Headquarters. Candidates may be inducted according to procedures suggested by the International Headquarters and/or the chapter. Induction, however, is not a requirement of active membership. A member is duly initiated when he or she pays membership dues to the International Headquarters and signs the oath of membership in a manner prescribed by the International Headquarters.</p>

                  <p>Should, for any reason, a member's name be removed from the international roll, he shall forfeit the right to wear the Society's Key and other regalia and shall forfeit the use of Phi Theta Kappa identification for scholarly and professional purposes.</p>

Regional organizations cannot modify the established International Office campaign procedures through a regional screening process or in any other way.</p>

                  <p>No student otherwise eligible for membership may be denied membership based on lack of participation in chapter activities.</p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p><strong>Adopted by the Phi Theta Kappa Board of Directors, January 1996:</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>All local chapter bylaws must be in compliance with the Phi Theta Kappa Constitution and Policies, and must be submitted to Headquarters for approval. All local chapter bylaws must be approved by the local college administration.</p> 
                  <p>This new policy statement is designed to address situations involving the question of who has the final authority in deciding issues that will affect the future of the chapter. This statement will give college administrators, chapter members and chapter advisors a better understanding of the proper channels to follow when a decision is not mutually agreed upon by the chapter advisor and voting members.</p> 
                  <p>Because the charter of a chapter is granted to an institution, that institution's top administrator --- the college president or campus CEO --- has the final authority on deciding an issue upon which the advisor and members cannot agree, as long as that decision is in compliance with the Phi Theta Kappa Constitution and Bylaws.</p> 
                  <p><strong>Example</strong>: If a chapter votes in favor of an issue that the advisor feels is not in the best interests of the chapter, the advisor, as an agent of the college, may veto the vote. If the chapter's voting members want to challenge that veto, they may present the issue to the college administrator charged with overseeing the local Phi Theta Kappa chapter. This individual is usually the Dean of Students or Vice President of Academic Affairs. If this administrator rules in favor of the advisor, the members may appeal this decision to the college president or campus CEO. Likewise, if the administrator rules in favor of the members, the advisor may appeal this decision to the college president or campus CEO.</p>

                 <blockquote>
                  <p><strong>Regarding the standard grade point average used to determine eligibility of students wishing to transfer their membership from one chapter to another:</strong></p> 
                  <p>The local chapter may use either their membership eligibility standard or maintenance standard when determining eligibility of Phi Theta Kappa members requesting to transfer membership into their chapter. The standard selected, however, must be used consistently and identified in the chapter's bylaws.</p> 
                  <p><strong>Regarding the appointment of Voting Delegates at International Conventions:</strong></p> 
                  <p>Only active members of active chapters may serve as voting delegates at the International Convention. Neither alumni members nor chapter advisors may serve as voting delegates for the chapter.</p> 
                  <p><strong>Regarding the appointment of chapter advisors in reference to their employment by the college where the chapter is located:</strong></p> 
                  <p>In order to serve as a chapter advisor, an individual must be an employee of the college where the chapter is located.</p>

                 <h3>Qualifications and Duties of a Regional Coordinator</h3>
                 <p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>The Regional Coordinator serves as the leader of the region. The Coordinator facilitates the integral relationship among chapters in the region, between Headquarters and the chapters, and between Phi Theta Kappa and the two-year college.</p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p><strong>I. Eligibility</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>1. The Regional Coordinator must be a two-year college chapter advisor. While it is not required by the Constitution and up to the Coordinator as to the extent of involvement, it is strongly recommended that each Coordinator work with a co-advisor.</p> 
                  <p>2. The Regional Coordinator must be an employee on at least a half-time basis having an annual contract or appointment with the same two-year college where serving as a chapter advisor. An annual contract or appointment means that the Coordinator has a binding commitment with that college to provide service for one academic year. Temporary changes in status due, for example, to sabbatical, parenting leave, or illness shall not affect eligibility.</p> 
                  <p>The concerns for strong connection to the college include communication, accessibility, visibility on the campus, support from administration, and direct and frequent contact with chapter members and co-advisors and with other chapters in the region.</p> 
                  <p>The Regional Coordinator will have office facilities, a telephone, mail box, and fax number on campus, in order to contribute to the life of the chapter, college, and region. It is expected that the Coordinator will have online access to electronic communication.</p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p><strong>II. Selection Process</strong></p> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>1. Headquarters will submit to chapter advisors and college presidents in the region forms for nominating chapter advisors for the position of Interim Coordinator.</p> 
                  <p>2. From these nominations a finalist(s) will be interviewed by the Executive Director.</p> 
                  <p>Selection of the Interim Coordinator will be announced in writing by Headquarters to all chapter advisors and college presidents.</p> 
                  <p>3. Following selection, the Interim Coordinator will attend an orientation session at Headquarters. During the orientation, the Interim Coordinator will work with the Director of Regional Programs who will assist in establishing goals, assign a mentor, and provide guidelines for the mentoring relationship.</p> 
                  <p>4. One year following the orientation, the Interim Coordinator will review with the Director of Regional Programs progress made toward the attainment of established goals.</p> 
                  <p>5. The Director of Regional Programs and the Associate Director will make a recommendation to the Executive Director regarding the appointment of the Interim Coordinator as Regional Coordinator.</p> 
                  <p>6. Following approval of the recommendation for the appointment of the Interim Coordinator as Regional Coordinator, the Executive Director will direct the Executive Committee to appoint the Regional Coordinator as outlined in Article V, Section 5(B) of the Phi Theta Kappa Constitution.</p> 
                  <p>Should the Interim Coordinator choose not to be considered as Regional Coordinator, or the Director of Regional Programs and the Associate Director not recommend the appointment of the Interim Coordinator as Regional Coordinator, or the Executive Director not approve the recommendation submitted, a new Interim Regional Coordinator will be selected according to the stated process.</p> 
                  <p>7. The Executive Director will notify the Interim Coordinator regarding appointment.</p> 
                  <p>8. Once the Regional Coordinator is appointed, Headquarters staff will notify in writing all chapter advisors and college presidents within the region.</p> 
                  <p>9. A Regional Coordinator will serve a one-year term, which is subject to renewal [Article V, Section 5(A) of the Phi Theta Kappa Constitution].</p>

                  <p>In support of the Society's Mission Statement, the Phi Theta Kappa Board of Directors adopts this Honor Code as a declaration of the high standards of conduct to which Regional Officers are held. This Honor Code is not simply a set of rules and procedures governing Regional Officers' academic conduct, nor is it a legal contractual obligation of Phi Theta Kappa or the Regional Officer; it is an opportunity to put personal responsibility and integrity into action. Regional Officers will abide by this code which liberates them to serve the Region and the Society in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and respect. The success of the Code depends upon the support of the Region. Infractions should be reported to a chapter advisor, who may communicate this information to the Regional Coordinator.</p>

                 <p><strong>Adopted by the Phi Theta Kappa Board of Directors, January 2000:</strong></p>
                 <h3>Professional Guidelines For Serving as an International Officer</h3> 
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>1. International Officers must be active participants in their local chapter activities.</p> 
                  <p>2. Phi Theta Kappa International Officers must enroll in and successfully complete a minimum of six credit hours in each of at least two semesters/quarters during their term. Up to three hours of coursework that does not require the student to be on campus may be counted in the six hour total.</p> 
                  <p>3. International Officers must not send mass mailings via e-mail or postal mail without consultation and approval from their International Headquarters contact.</p> 
                  <p>4. International Officers must not initiate or commit the Society to programs or projects without prior consultation and approval from their International Headquarters contact.</p> 
                  <p>5. International Officers must not make their own Society-related travel arrangements. Their International Headquarters contact will approve and confirm Officers' airline and hotel reservations to Society-related events. Once the Officers' travel is confirmed, Officers must not change travel arrangements except in cases of emergency, and then only at the approval of their International Headquarters contact.</p> 
                  <p>6. International Officers must include their International Headquarters contact in all conference calls in which all Officers are participating in order to promote a climate for effective and open communication.</p> 
                  <p>7. International Officers must submit all Regional Meeting Reports and Expense Reports to the International Headquarters contact no more than three days after returning from a Society event.</p> 
                  <p>8. International Officers must obtain prior approval from their International Headquarters contact before sending any mass correspondence to Society constituents.</p> 
                  <p>9. International Officers must send their International Headquarters contact courtesy copies of all official correspondence e-mailed or postal mailed to regional officers, regional coordinators and other Society constituents.</p> 
                  <p>10. International Officers must not solicit invitations to attend Society-related events.</p> 
                  <p>11. International Officers must direct all invitations to attend chapter or regional events to their International Headquarters contact. Officers must not accept invitations to attend Society-related events without prior consultation and approval from their International Headquarters contact.</p> 
                  <p>12. International Officers must not schedule meetings or activities with Phi Theta Kappa chapters or regions without advance consultation with their International Headquarters contact. International Headquarters establishes each Officer's participation in Society-related events. Officers must not attend Society-related events that International Headquarters has not assigned and/or approved for them to attend, even if the Officer is willing to cover expenses associated with attending the events.</p> 
                  <p>13. International Officers must not rely on their advisor, secretary or relatives to correspond with International Headquarters. Officers are responsible for personally fulfilling all responsibilities. International Officers must personally complete their Regional Meeting Reports, Regional Expense Reports and all other assignments.</p> 
                  <p>14. International Officers must not make personal transactions on their Phi Theta Kappa Business Charge Card.</p> 
                  <p>15. International Officers must plan ahead for speaking engagements and should not request that Headquarters staff ship materials and supplies to them for overnight or rush delivery.</p> 
                  <p>16. International Officers must understand that policies and procedures regarding Officers vary from year to year depending on the Society's budget, resources and priorities. Privileges, requirements or responsibilities of previous International Officers may not necessarily be applicable to the current International Officers.</p>
