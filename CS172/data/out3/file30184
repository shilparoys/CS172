       <p class="t-italic t-strong t-taut">What information does U.S. News collect about me as I use the U.S. News Services?</p> 
       <p>U.S. News may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, telephone number, postal address, e-mail address, location, and credit card information so that we or selected companies can provide you with the products and services you request. For example, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, and certain other information in connection with certain features. U.S. News may also collect your credit card information when you make a purchase, so that we can process your payment for the product or service you are requesting. During the ordering process, such credit card information is transmitted either to U.S. News or to the particular supplier or service provider who provides the service you are purchasing. In both cases, credit card information is then transmitted to third-party credit card processors and card issuers that use your information to process your order.</p> 
       <p>U.S. News may also collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit the U.S. News Services, such as your browser configuration, the type of operating system you are using, and information about your Internet service provider.</p> 
       <p class="t-italic t-strong t-taut">How does U.S. News use the information supplied by me?</p> 
       <p>We may use the information you supply to fulfill your requests for products and services, to respond to your inquiries, and to offer other products and services from either us or selected companies which may be of interest to you. If you decide that you do not wish to receive such communications from U.S. News and others, you may opt-out of receiving further e-mails and other communications by clicking "Unsubscribe" in any email. If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a letter to our editors, or information to be posted as a comment), we may publish your name, screen name or such other information you supply.</p> 
       <p>If you have indicated interest in receiving information directly from a selected outside company, we may provide such selected outside company with information that may include but not be limited to your name, telephone number, postal address and email address. If you decide that you do not wish to receive further communications from such selected outside company, you will need to so notify such selected outside company.</p> 
       <p>We sometimes use non-personally identifiable information we collect through our use of cookies to improve the design, delivery and content of our publications and the U.S. News Services and to enable us to personalize your user experience. We may also use the non-personally identifiable information we collect in the aggregate to analyze how visitors use the U.S. News Services, as well as to provide you with offers and information about products and services which you have agreed to receive.</p> 
       <p>In addition, U.S. News may disclose information we maintain (A) if in good faith we believe that such disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the U.S. News Services; or (4) protect the personal safety, property, or rights of our users or the public, or (B) in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale.</p> 
       <p class="t-italic t-strong t-taut">How can I change my privacy options?</p> 
       <p>If at some point after giving U.S. News your personally identifying information, you do not wish to continue to receive additional information and offers from U.S. News about U.S. News, from U.S. News's affiliates, or from selected outside companies, you may opt out of receiving future emails by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of each e-mail.
