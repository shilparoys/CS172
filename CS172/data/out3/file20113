          <p>The Hites Transfer Scholarship recognizes outstanding academic achievement, engagement in college and community activities and leadership accomplishment of Phi Theta Kappa members preparing to transfer to senior institutions in pursuit of baccalaureate degrees.</p> 
          <p>Members may begin applying for this scholarship in October and applications are due in early December each year. An independent team of judges reviews the applications to determine scholarship recipients. Phi Theta Kappa will notify all students of winner or non-winner status each July.</p> 
          <p>The scholarships are funded by a scholarship endowment established in 2010 as a result of a matching grant from the Hites Family Community College Scholarship Foundation. The first Hites Scholars were announced in 2010, expanding Phi Theta Kappaâ€™s commitment to support community college students in their pursuits of baccalaureate degrees.</p>
