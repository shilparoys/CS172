The HireLifeScience.com Career Fair 2015 will take place at Raritan Center - New Jersey Convention &amp; Exposition Center in Edison, NJ. There will be no recruiting agencies participating in this event, making it one of the few times candidates will meet exclusively with direct employers from the life science industries. This means direct access with the exact contacts that will do the interviewing and no middle men! Candidates must possess a 4 year life science related degree and 2 years professional experience working for a Life Science related company. An invitation to attend will be sent if the minimum qualifications are met. Novo Nordisk, Covance, Johnson &amp; Johnson and many more will be in attendance.
