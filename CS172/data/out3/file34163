     <h1>Funding Opportunities at UCR</h1> 
     <p>UCR offers a variety of multi-year funding opportunities for incoming students that may include stipends, full or partial payment of tuition and fees, and appointment as a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Graduate Student Researcher (GSR). An applicant is judged on the basis of the quality of previous academic work, the evidence of ability to do research and other creative accomplishments, and the promise of becoming a productive scholar. A contribution to the campus goal of achieving a diverse student body may also be a consideration. Fellowship/grant awards are paid from a variety of funding sources, some of which require financial data. Students who receive fellowships, and full or partial teaching and research positions must register for and complete a full program of study and research each quarter, remain in good academic standing and make acceptable progress toward their degree.</p> 
     <h3>Fellowships</h3> 
     <p><span>All recipients of fellowships:</span></p> 
     <ul> 
      <li> <p><span>must be making acceptable progress toward their degrees (For these purposes, acceptable progress for a Ph.D. student means students must be advanced to candidacy within 12 quarters after entry and must complete the degree by the normative time to degree for the particular program plus one year. For most master's students, acceptable progress is represented by enrollment for not more than three years.);</span></p> </li> 
      <li> <p><span>must have less than 8 units of Incomplete grades;</span></p> </li> 
      <li> <p><span>must maintain a 3.00 GPA</span></p> </li> 
      <li> <p><span>must enroll in and complete a full course load (12 graduate units or the equivalent)</span></p> </li> 
      <li> <p><span>changes in degree objective and/or degree program may affect eligibility for continuation of the award.</span></p> </li> 
     </ul> 
     <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p> 
     <p>Fellowships are awarded to students to free them from the need for employment. Fellowship awards with less than a $10,000 stipend may be supplemented. Fellowship awards with a minimum of a $10,000 stipend may be supplemented only after approval of the Graduate Dean. It is not unusual for the Dean to approve employment of up to 10 hours a week (25 percent time) during the tenure of an award. Employment may be approved up to 50 percent time for limited periods, but only if employment averages 25 percent or less over the course of the academic year. The Graduate Advisor in your program must make the request of the Dean in writing. Fellowships that do not allow supplementation are the Dissertation Year Fellowships (DYFA and DYP). &nbsp;The Graduate Research Mentorship Program allows limited supplementation as a 25% Graduate Student Researcher appointment (GSR).&nbsp;</p> 
     <h3>Eugene Cota-Robles Award (ECRA)</h3> 
     <p style="margin-top: 0.1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.1pt;">This four-year fellowship program, funded by the University of California Office of the President, the UCR Graduate Division, and the home department, supports a limited number of students entering PhD programs and are interested in a career in college or university teaching. The fellowship currently provides a stipend of $24,000 that supplements a financial award created by the home program. This award includes payment of tuition and non-resident supplemental tuition if necessary. Applicants must be nominated by their graduate program. Students pursuing degrees other than the PhD are not eligible for this program.</p> 
     <p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in 0.1pt 30px;">&nbsp;</p> 
     <p style="margin-top: 0.1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.1pt;">Applicants must be either U.S. citizens or permanent residents, must be academically meritorious and should demonstrate high potential and promise. Individuals from cultural, racial, linguistic, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds that are currently underrepresented in graduate education are especially encouraged to participate in the program. The intent of this fellowship is to provide access to higher education for students who might otherwise find it difficult or impossible to successfully pursue graduate study. Applicants must complete the Supplemental Fellowship Form included as an optional form in the UCR Graduate Application for Admission. This form will be reviewed as part of your submitted graduate application.</p> 
     <h3>Dissertation Research Grant</h3> 
     <p>provides funds to doctoral candidates for research-related expenses associated with the dissertation. Applicants must be advanced to candidacy and plan to be registered during the period of the award. Proposals may be funded up to a maximum of $1,000.&nbsp;</p> 
     <ul>

     </ul> 
     <h3>Master's Thesis Research Grant</h3>

     </ul> 
     <h3>Graduate Student Association Conference Travel Grants</h3> 
     <p>help to meet the financial needs of students who have been invited to present scholarly papers or posters at regional and national professional conferences. The program, administered by the UCR <a href="http://www.GSA.ucr.edu/">Graduate Student Association</a>, funds both conference attendees and presenters, with attendees reimbursed at one half the rate of presenters. The percentage of reimbursement is set monthly and is based on the volume of applications received.</p> 
     <h3><a href="http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html">UC Graduate Fellows in the Humanities</a></h3> 
     <p>One year fellowships for exceptional graduate students in the humanities who have advanced to candidacy and are in the final stages of completing their dissertations. The award is equivalent to the Graduate Division’s Dissertation Fellowship competition and runs through this competition. UC Graduate Fellows will be selected from those applying for Dissertation Fellowships.&nbsp; UC Graduate Fellows are in residence at the Center for Ideas and Society where they have their own work-space.&nbsp; They are also part of the all-UC Society of Fellows.&nbsp; UC Graduate Fellows have the option of giving a lecture on campus during their fellowship year.&nbsp;For more information go to: <a href="http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html">http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html</a></p> 
     <h3><a href="http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html">The Humanities Graduate Student Research Grants</a></h3> 
     <p>The Humanities Graduate Student Research Grants financially assist graduate students doing original research or creative projects in the humanities, as broadly defined by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Awards are up to $1500.The grant period runs from May through April. Extensions of the grant period should be requested in writing. Awards terminate upon leaves of absence, filing fee status, withdrawal or graduation. A student must be registered in the Spring Quarter to use these funds during the summer months. For more information go to: <a href="http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html">http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html</a></p> 
     <h3>Graduate Research Mentoring Program and Dissertation Year Program Awards</h3> 
     <p>The Graduate Research Mentoring Program (GRMP) award is intended to enhance the mentoring of domestic PhD students entering their 3rd, 4th, or 5th years of graduate school who are actively engaged in research. The Dissertation Year Program (DYP) Award is intended for MFA or PhD students who expect to complete their degree program the year in which the award is received. A single application may be used for both awards which provide stipends and cover fees from 1 to 3 quarters.&nbsp; Eligible students can receive up to three quarters each of the DYP and GRMP fellowships and may reapply if they have not reached this max.</p>
