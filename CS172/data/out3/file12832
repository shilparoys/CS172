          <p><b>Campus Clean-Up:</b> It was a lot of fun going around the campus and making it look better. With all the clean-up we did that day, it felt like I really made a difference. It was one of the most rewarding things I have done around campus.</p>

It opens up a new perspective. Moreover, it is SO MUCH FUN. I get to meet a lot of different people in this conference and make friends with them. So, IÂd definitely go again this year to make more friends!!! <br> <br> <b>Seattle Trip:</b> As international students, this is new strange place! So, get to know your surroundings by exploring Seattle! ItÂs so much fun when we go to a new place, see new things and make new friends! I loved the Seattle Trip!!! </p>

This was really awesome because any students (international and domestic) could join and have a great time together. They should go this event because they can meet new friends and know a new culture. <br> <br> <b>CORE:</b> This is an overnight trip for new international students to make new friends to be ready for their first new quarter and to get useful information in order to live on campus. This is really fun and a good opportunity to adapt to a new environment in a different country. Besides that, students can ask questions to international and domestic student leaders. </p>

There is no reason not to come out and enjoy the sun and fun! </p> 
          <p><b>Drive-In Movie:</b> This year we are having a Drive-In Movie on campus as well as in the community. The two movies we will show on campus are ÂThe HangoverÂ and ÂSherlock Holmes.Â I am excited to just lie under the stars and watch good movies on campus with all of my friends. Plus, the big screen is definitely more intriguing than anything found in anyoneÂs living room. </p>

These entertainers show the many elements of culture, music and dance that the Pacific Northwest has to offer. This is a great opportunity for students to explore the many aspects of hip hop in todayÂs urban Seattle area and IÂm really excited to go to the concert! </p>

          <p><b>Snowboarding Trip:</b> As an international student, experiencing something we have never tried before is valuable. I was able to enjoy a beautiful view and get to know more people which is exciting for an international student like me. </p> 
          <p><b>Skagit Valley Tulip Festival:</b> Going on this trip gave me the opportunity to explore something new AND pretty. I had the chance to meet so many new students on this trip and see beautiful flowers, too! </p>

          <p><b>Student Rally at the Capitol: </b>I thought this trip was great and super important because students were given a chance to stand up for their education in front of WashingtonÂs government and be an active influence in the decision-making. </p> 
          <p><b>Fall Fling:</b> Having blow-up toys, music shows, food and activities really eases the anxiety of new school and a new year. And itÂs FREE! Green River cares that much about welcoming students to start their education. </p>

          <p><b>Senior CitizenÂs ValentineÂs Day Dance:</b> I was initially excited about this event because I enjoy ballroom dancing but after dancing with some of the senior citizens and listening to them share old memories with loved ones, I began to realize how rewarding it is to get involved with our campus and community. </p> 
          <p><b>Campus Corner Apartments Welcome Social: </b>This event is held at the beginning of each quarter at the campus apartments to welcome new residents. There is food, music and tons of games. It is a great way to make new friends and get plugged in to the campus community. </p>

          <p><b>Oceans Movie Trip: </b>I am really stoked to go see the movie <i>Oceans</i> with a group from school. The movie looks incredible: it has amazing footage of beautiful scenery and wildlife, it promotes environmental awareness, and itÂs even narrated by Pierce Bronsnan! It should be a fun and educational opportunity to socialize with other students. </p> 
          <p><b>Gator Bash: </b>This is the springÂs weeklong festival-style event on campus and itÂs going to be amazing! Last year, when the event was called Spring-a-Palooza, I had a blast! It was my favorite event of the year. The school brings in great live music from many talented artists, hosts many interactive activities for students to get involved in, and has lots of opportunities for free food! I have a feeling that Gator Bash just might be the best event of the year. </p>
