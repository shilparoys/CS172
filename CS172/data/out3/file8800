      <h2>About</h2> 
      <p> 3D viewers as web page plugins are often difficult to use. Many require Flash or Java in the browser, which is problematic in several ways. Some failed to gain traction with the general public due to complex user interfaces or learning curves. </p> 
      <p> We wanted a <a href="http://www.iris.edu/3dv/index.html?caller=sm&amp;st=1970-01-01&amp;et=2025-01-01&amp;ob=time-desc&amp;li=400&amp;xla=50.512&amp;nla=26.981&amp;xlo=158.730&amp;nlo=129.025&amp;sbl=1&amp;sz=med">simpler solution</a>, a way to rotate and zoom in on sets of earthquakes which would be both easy to use and lack the complexity and security issues of the plugin approach. 3DV uses standard HTML5 techniques to accomplish that goal. </p> 
      <p>It is normally invoked from the <a href="/ieb/index.html">IRIS Earthquake Browser</a> (IEB), as one of various commands that can be performed on a selected set of earthquakes. 3DV can also be invoked directly by simply bookmarking it. </p> 
      <p class="remark">This project began in 2011 as a copy of the cool, molecule-viewing webapp called <a href="http://alteredqualia.com/canvasmol/">CanvasMol</a>, with the gracious permission of the author. Also, Gary Parvis kindly contributed the use of a regional coordinate conversion algorithm and related source code.</p>

      <h2>Usage</h2> 
      <p> Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. </p> 
      <p> Drag with the mouse to rotate. </p> 
      <p>The View menu lets you do things like:</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>hide/show axes, coastline and/or plate boundaries</li> 
       <li>reset to a known position, such as "look down" or "look north"</li> 
       <li>auto-rotate around one or more of the three axes </li> 
       <li>make the spheres smaller or larger, shaded or solid</li> 
       <li>enable touch mode, for use on a mobile device </li> 
       <li>take a snapshot of the scene as a PNG image</li> 
      </ul> 
      <h3>Mobile use </h3> 
      <p>On mobile devices the performance will be quite a bit slower. Tablets generally work OK, but the smartphones tested were not very satisfying. Fewer earthquakes, under maybe 800, is best for mobile use.</p> 
      <p style="font-size:1.2em;">In all cases turn View / Shading off to drastically improve performance.</p> 
      <h3>Browsers</h3> 
      <p>Internet Explorer before version 9 is not being targeted for support. V9 is marginally successful, and 10 is a bit better. But WebKit-based browsers, such as Chrome, Safari and (the new) <a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/next">Opera Next</a>, as well as the Gecko-based, such as Firefox, are so much better, and we recommend them.</p> 
      <p>Opera (before Next) does not get along with 3DV.</p>

      <h2>Tips</h2> 
      <ul> 
       <li> Start with smaller numbers of earthquakes, such as 800, and work up. Turn shading off if things are slow.<br> <p class="remark"><br> The number of earthquakes you view is critical to the performance of rotation and zooming. If your browser becomes unresponsive (you might even need to restart it), reduce the number of earthquakes selected in IEB and try again. Older computers and browsers are more prone to this limitation.<br><br>If you drag the with mouse and do not see immediate rotation, then release the mouse and wait a bit, then consider dismissing that window and starting again with fewer earthquakes.<br><br>Turning shading off in the View menu can help tremendously.<br><br>Finally, the number of other web pages open and programs running (available memory) is going to affect your mileage.</p> </li> 
       <li> Savvy computer users will notice that a 3DV URL contains parameters (such as lats; lons; ranges of time, depth, magnitude, etc) which can be changed by directly editing them.<br> Feel free to experiment, but this method of invoking 3DV is not well-tested at this time. </li> 
       <li> Although you are able to select very large regions in IEB for viewing in 3DV, it isn't satisfying. The spherical nature of such regions, the distortion of the axes, and the erosion of the concept of "up" and "down" make it interesting, but unrewarding. A rule of thumb would be don't bother with regions that are more than about 1/4 of the world. And more earthquakes, in small-to-medium regions, tends to be more interesting. </li> 
      </ul>
