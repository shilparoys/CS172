The two top scoring applicants (who are not selected as Guistwhite Scholars) will each receive a $1,500 scholarship.

Students must be enrolled a minimum of part-time in a bachelor’s degree program at a four-year college for the fall term in the year following their fall application. Applicants must meet all eligibility criteria for and complete the Guistwhite Scholarship application. For more information, please visit the Guistwhite Scholarship information.</p>
