          <p>After getting her BA in Mathematics from Cambridge University, UK in 2002, Anna Kelbert got lured into geophysics by the promise of inverse problems: an exciting technique that provides a sneak peek into objects that cannot be directly measured or observed, such as the insides of the brain, or the insides of the Earth. She went on to devise a new method of imaging of the global electrical conductivity in the Earth¹s mantle, providing a useful additional constraint on mantle water content. These results formed the basis of her PhD in geophysics, obtained from Cardiff University, UK in 2006. At a mid-point of her PhD program, she followed her supervisor to Oregon State University, located in a beautiful small town of Corvallis, OR. Anna stayed there ever since, first as a postdoctoral researcher, then a Research Associate, and recently promoted to an Assistant Professor (Senior Research). Together with her colleagues at Oregon State University, she developed novel inversion codes in magnetotellurics, and employed these tools to image the partial melts and fluids beneath western United States with EarthScope MT data, a comprehensive data set comparable to the seismic Transportable Array, which Anna helped to quality control, process and archive. In the past few years, her continued research on global electrical conductivity of the Earth gave her new insights on the deep processes at subduction zone margins. Anna is also interested in cyberinfrastructure efforts aimed to improve knowledge integration and accessibility both within and across disciplines in geosciences. In her talk, Anna hopes to convey the value of electromagnetic methods in providing additional constraints on the deep Earth structure, particularly in complicated subduction settings. She is available for talks in fall and spring of 2014-2015, spring being preferable.</p>

          <h4>Presentation: Water Content and Processes in Complicated Subduction Settings as Inferred with Electromagnetic Methods</h4> 
          <p>Natural source electromagnetic induction methods in geophysics include the local to regional scale magnetotelluric method, and the global to semi-global electromagnetics. Introduced in 1950-s, these methods have rapidly developed in the past 20 years to produce high resolution 3D images of the electrical conductivity in the Earth¹s crust and upper mantle. Electrical conductivity is most sensitive to the presence of fluids and partial melts, and therefore provides a view that¹s highly complementary to the seismic wave velocities. In this talk, I aim to introduce the methods through a tour of one of their most useful deep Earth applications: complicated subduction zone regions. I make use of the versatility of our techniques to look at subduction zones, globally, through the lens of electrical conductivity images; then zoom in to regional scales. I give an overview of electromagnetic constraints on the Philippine Sea plate subduction beneath China and Japan; the Nazca and Cocos plate subduction in South and Central Americas; and finally the younger subduction in North America, as imaged by EarthScope MT and the earlier studies. Throughout my brief global tour I try to show that electromagnetic inversion images the slabs and the associated volcanic arcs in a geophysically consistent manner that complements the seismic results, while adding independent and valuable information on the water content and the associated subduction-related processes.</p>

          <p>Anne Egger thought she might major in biology until she started running rivers on the Colorado Plateau, where she became far more interested in the rocks than in the vegetation. Her experience as a river guide has informed her teaching and research ever since. She received her undergraduate degree in geology from Yale University and her MS and PhD in geology from Stanford University, and is now an Assistant Professor at Central Washington University with a joint appointment in Geological Sciences and Science Education. This joint appointment reflects her research interests: her geologic research is focused on the tectonic development of the western margin of the Basin and Range province, and her geoscience education research is focused on developing curricular materials that incorporate societal issues, data, and geoscientific thinking. She has facilitated undergraduate curricular design at a variety of institutions, from reviving Stanford’s undergraduate geophysics program to reflect the diverse research interests of the faculty, to developing the first Earth science undergraduate degree in Singapore at Nanyang Technological University, to reforming the Middle-Level Science Teaching major at CWU to better meet the Next Generation Science Standards. She is particularly interested in emphasizing the connections between research and education at all levels: incorporating scientific research results into science classes, reforming teaching based on scientific results, and involving students in authentic scientific experiences.</p>

          <h4>Presentation: Integrating Teaching and Research with a 21st Century Toolbox</h4> 
          <p>As geoscientists in the 21st century, we have an enormous variety of tools and vast datasets at our disposal. Worldwide imagery and high-resolution topography are widely available for free; real-time data are available on the web–much of it through EarthScope–for earthquakes, geodesy, atmospheric and oceanic parameters, and more; sophisticated computation is available through laptop computers. These tools and techniques serve our interests both in research and in teaching to reach a broad audience, from general education students to advanced geoscience majors. Through the InTeGrate project (NSF’s STEP Center in the Geosciences), we have developed a rubric-based process for developing curricular materials that teach geoscience in the context of grand challenges, develop interdisciplinary problem solving skills, make use of authentic geoscience data, develop geoscientific thinking skills, and develop systems thinking skills. These materials are supporting programmatic and institutional change to broaden access to the geosciences, strengthen the role of geoscience in teacher preparation and general education programs, and infuse geoscience content into other majors, such as economics, sociology, biology, and literature. This talk will draw from the results of the InTeGrate project, but can be tailored to the needs and interests of departments to focus strategies for incorporating active learning with EarthScope and other data into the geoscience curriculum, developing geoscientific thinking skills in all students, broader initiatives in STEM education and how geoscience fits in, among other possibilities.</p>

          <p>David Schmidt uses geodetic tools to study the active deformation of the earth’s crust. His primary scientific interest is the study of fault processes along plate boundaries. He specializes in using InSAR data to study a variety of processes, including imaging shallow creep on active faults, the kinematics of slow moving landslides, glaciers, volcanic unrest, and land subsidence. His research group is actively studying slow slip and tremor on the Cascadia subduction zone. David is also currently involved in the development of an earthquake early warning system for the Pacific Northwest. For his undergraduate training, David attended the University of California, San Diego. He pursued his Ph.D. in Geophysics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he used InSAR to characterize deformation in the San Francisco Bay Area. Following a postdoc at Stanford University, David moved to the Pacific Northwest and served as a faculty member at the University of Oregon. He is currently an associate professor at the University of Washington. David has served on a number of committees, most recently the WInSAR Executive Committee, UNAVCO’s Education and Community Engagement Committee, as well as a term on a NSF panel. He is available for talks in the winter and spring of 2015.</p>

          <h4>Presentation: The Silent Life and Quivering Fits of the Cascadia Subduction Zone</h4> 
          <p>The Cascadia subduction zone had long been thought to be aseismic given the lack of background seismicity. However, key observations over the past three decades have provided evidence of past large ruptures (up to Mw 9). Today we know that strain is accumulating on the plate interface, as revealed by observations of crustal deformation along the coast. However, the accumulation and release of strain is heterogeneous in space and time. Significant strain is stored over the duration of the earthquake cycle (100’s-of-years) and will eventually be released in the next megathrust event. Some strain is stored and released over short periods (months-to-years) in the form of slow slip and tremor.</p> 
          <p>In this presentation, I describe the range of interseismic deformational processes that occur along the plate interface on the Cascadia subduction zone as revealed by GPS, leveling, and tremor data. These data constrain the rate of strain accumulation and provide important constraints on the seismic hazard. The data also allow us to map out the pattern of long-term and transient locking associated with the silent accumulation of strain and the quivering fits of slow slip events. I will present new modeling results that describe the time-dependent distribution of locking and strain release along the plate boundary. The diverse, time-dependent faulting behavior suggests that fault properties and physical conditions are heterogeneous. I will review and hypothesize on which physical properties exert the greatest control on the faulting behavior as a function of depth along the plate interface. Finally, I will highlight the scientific questions that remain unanswered for Cascadia and the exciting opportunities for new research on the horizon.</p>

          <p>Mark Simons is a geophysicist interested in physics of the earthquake cycle, volcanic unrest, structure and dynamics of the upper mantle, glacier mechanics and the application of space geodesy to rapid disaster response. Mark’s earliest research was on multi-scale analysis of global gravity fields to understand upper mantle dynamics on Venus and the Earth. Subsequently, he shifted to problems in lithospheric dynamics, primarily with an emphasis on continued development of InSAR techniques and combination of GPS and InSAR observations to constrain deformation processes. Mark enjoys problems in inverse theory, particularly as applied to our understanding of fault slip in major plate boundary fault systems (e.g., Japan, California, Chile/Peru, and Turkey). He received his B.Sc. degree in geophysics from UCLA in 1989 and his Ph.D. in geophysics from M.I.T. in 1996. He started at Caltech as postdoc in 1996 and joined the faculty there in 1998. Mark has served on the PBO steering committee and the NASA Earth Science Subcommittee. He is currently on the science definition team for the upcoming U.S./India dedicated InSAR mission expected to launch this decade.</p>

          <p>Ved Lekic is a seismologist at the University of Maryland, where he has been an assistant professor in the Department of Geology since 2012. His main scientific interests are the state, dynamics, and dominant processes of the solid Earth, as well as those of other planets and satellites. The main focus of his research is developing higher resolution imaging techniques and obtaining more reliable constraints on structures in the Earth’s deep interior. After receiving his A.B. in Astronomy and Astrophysics and Earth and Planetary Sciences from Harvard University in 2004, he obtained his Ph.D. in geophysics at UC Berkeley in 2009, where he worked under the supervision of Prof. Barbara Romanowicz on full waveform global seismic tomography. In 2010, he received a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship to work with Prof. Karen Fischer at Brown University on imaging lithospheric structure using converted waves. In 2014, he was recognized with the Charles F. Richter Early Career Award from the Seismological Society of America. Ved is committed to improving undergraduate science education by involving students in genuine, extended research experiences, and has received a National Science Foundation Early Career Faculty Development Program award to further this goal.</p>

          <h4>Presentation: Imaging Tectonic Plates - Structure and Deformation of North America</h4> 
          <p>The rigid, outermost layer of the Earth – called the lithosphere – is broken up into a dozen major tectonic plates, whose relative motions cause most earthquakes and volcanism. Much of what we know about the structure of the plates comes from studying what happens near the surface. Seismic waves recorded by large arrays such as the EarthScope Transportable Array can be used to image the internal structure down to the base of the lithosphere beneath continents, at 100-200 km depth. These images provide direct constraints on how geological features and deformation observed at the surface relate to deep structure.</p> 
          <p>In this talk, I will use seismic data to explore how lithospheric structure varies across the western United States. I will primarily images made using observations of conversions between shear (S) and compressional (P) seismic waves that occur as waves cross lithospheric interfaces. These new images lead to surprising discoveries concerning the structure of and deformation within continental lithosphere. For example, abrupt variations of lithospheric thickness in regions of active deformation run contrary to our expectations. The images also suggest the presence of mid-lithospheric discontinuities, whose nature and origin remain puzzling. To better understand what these features tell us about the behavior of continental plates, I will relate them to the geologic history of the region, drawing inferences on the distribution of deformation with depth. Since further progress requires higher resolution images, I will preview cutting edge developments in seismology, which offer the prospect of deeper understanding of lithospheric structure.</p>
