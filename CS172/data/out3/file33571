      </div> 
      <p> MADISON, Wis. — For Mark Johnson, the guy many believe to be the best of a group of 20 kids who shocked the hockey world 35 years ago today in Lake Placid, heaven comes on a sheet of ice measuring 32’ x 58’ just a few yards off his back patio. It’s his own man-made rink, the one he started building 12 years ago when he moved to this edge of Madison, the home of the University of Wisconsin.</p> 
      <p> The rink comes complete with wood boards about a foot high, overhead lights, nets and an ice-way — think of a frozen walkway — that takes you from his finished basement to outdoor splendor, a little stretch of arctic earth on this southwest corner of town.</p> 
      <p> It’s hockey the way it ought to be for Johnson, who was raised on the game by his late father, Hall of Fame UW hockey coach Bob Johnson, best known as “Badger Bob” around here. For Mark, the rink is as much a part of him as beat-up skates and the icy winds off the lakes that dot Madtown.</p> 
      <p> It’s shinny hockey, pickup puck or outdoor puck, whatever you want to call it. It’s the game he played as a boy with kids from the outlying neighborhoods, kids like fellow Lake Placid hero Eric Heiden, playing on the outdoor rinks and iced-over ponds of these very same parts, always beneath a ceiling unlimited.</p> 
      <p> “You hoped that the wind was blowing in the direction of the paper mill because the odor was just unbearable,” he says laughing.</p> 
      <p> “This is the pure part of the game,” says Johnson. “No referees, no parents, just a sheet of ice, the stars; it’s pretty good.”</p> 
      <p> This is the place that embodies everything Mark Johnson loves about the game, the hockey equivalent of Field of Dreams: family coming together, a group of friends, kids from the neighborhood, all lacing up their skates and heading out to the backyard for a game or two or four. No one home? No problem. There’s water in the fridge for whoever needs it.</p> 
      <p> In a very real way, it is the continuation of his father’s life’s work, spreading the game to anyone and everyone. And just like a backyard pond, this rink is open all day and all night to anyone who wants to play.</p> 
      <p> “The way it should be,” he says with a slight smile. “If you hear pucks hitting the boards it’s a good sign.”</p> 
      <p> And at any given time, looking out the windows of his kitchen or living room, you might see a group of kids out there playing into the wee hours.</p>

      <p> “The only thing is you have to turn the lights off when you leave,” he says.</p> 
      <p> It’s the only rule. There are no others.</p> 
      <p> Mention his rink and he starts beaming, lighting up like a schoolboy on the first day of snow, inviting anyone over who cares to see it. The Wisconsin version of dive on in, the water is fine.</p> 
      <p> “Each year it gets little better,” he says.</p> 
      <p> “It’s his baby,” says daughter Mikayla, sounding ever-so-slightly usurped.</p> 
      <p> Walk down into his basement and enter a massive family room with tall windows that look out onto his rink. Snake past the Ping-Pong and felt-covered card tables into the equipment room, a long utility closet stocked with sticks, skates, pads, whatever anyone might need to get on the ice.</p> 
      <p> “You wanna skate?” asks Johnson. He’s not 57 anymore; he’s suddenly 9.</p> 
      <p> He thumbs through two rows of shelves lined with blades. His dad’s are there, the very pair Badger Bob wore when he coached the Penguins to the Cup in 1991, his name scribbled on the bottom. Far from beneath a pane of glass at the Hockey Hall of Fame, they’re just sitting there, waiting to be worn by anyone size 10½.</p> 
      <p> With skates laced, Johnson opens the backdoor and steps onto his ice-way, making it over to his rink, then it’s over the foot-high boards and onto the ice, lit from end to end.</p> 
      <div class="a-module">

      <p> He corrals the puck with his left-hand stick and starts carving the cracked ice beneath his skates.</p> 
      <p> “He still has it,” says Mikayla.</p> 
      <p> You won’t find a Zamboni here, of course, fresh ice is laid down from water from a hose; he just put this coat down a couple weeks ago.</p> 
      <p> The sky is clear and the air bites as the temperature drops below zero.</p> 
      <p> No matter, it’s a great day for hockey as his dad would always say.</p> 
      <p> This is the place for Mark Johnson, the man they called Magic for his dazzling play on the ice. The place to get away for a bit, a place of calm beneath a clear sky or starry night, a place to collect his thoughts and reconnect to the game at its roots. A place to be a kid again.</p> 
      <p> ***</p> 
      <p> It’s a place a long way — 774 miles to be exact — from the hysteria Mark Johnson helped spark on a rink in Lake Placid 35 years ago, when he and 19 Team USA teammates, college kids, coached by a <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/brooks-gold-medal-article-1.2023605">no-nonsense taskmaster named Herb Brooks,</a></strong> turned the hockey world inside out, defeating the heavily favored Russians, and winning gold in the most improbable and incomprehensible two weeks in sports history.</p> 
      <p> “It’s great that somebody’s recognizing Mark for who he was, the best player and most important player on our team,” says Mike Eruzione, the team’s captain. “We don’t win without Mark. ... In order for us to win, Mark had to be Mark. And he was. When we needed big goals, Mark scored them.”</p>

        <span class="a-caption" itemprop="description">Miracle on Ice star Mark Johnson holds up the jersey he wore when he scored two goals to help U.S. hockey team beat the heavily-favored Soviets at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.</span> 
        <a class="a-enlarge" href="#"></a> 
       </figure> 
      </div> 
      <p> Johnson scored two goals against the Soviets that Friday afternoon, <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/u-s-shocks-russians-4-3-article-1.2014732">the game known as The Miracle on Ice</a></strong> that later inspired the movie “Miracle,” and assisted on the game-winner to beat Finland two days later. He added an insurance goal in that one, too. In all, he led Team USA with 11 points (5 goals, 6 assists).</p> 
      <p> “It still amazes me as we sit here and talk 35 years later that actually happened and the way it happened,” says Johnson. “And you look back at all the things over the course of that winter for us to get there and get ourselves into position and actually do it.”</p> 
      <p> Mark Johnson got his first taste of Olympic hockey back in 1975 when he was still a senior at Madison’s Memorial High School. Dad was the coach of the ’76 team, running the entire operation out of the family garage like a start-up dot.com. “If something got delivered, sweatsuits, equipment it went right into our garage,” Johnson says.</p> 
      <p> Mark was a young talent then, a star at Memorial, making up for a less-than-imposing physique with a brilliant sense of timing and an uncanny ability to score.</p> 
      <p> “I remember the guy was just a super gifted hockey player,” says Heiden, who won five speedskating golds at Lake Placid. “We all kind of looked up to him, jealous of the skills that he had, even as a young kid.”</p> 
      <p> “He needed to put rocks in his pocket to make it to 150 (pounds)” remembers Denny Helwig, now the Assistant Athletic Director for Sports Medicine at UW who goes back with Johnson to those high school days. “Because (Mark) was so young there was a little bit of controversy at the time about Bob having his own son on the team, but really Mark had enough talent to be there.”</p> 
      <p> But Badger Bob thought his son just wasn’t ready for the ’76 Innsbruck Games and cut him one Sunday night over dinner.</p> 
      <p> Mark laughs about it today. It stung then.</p> 
      <p> “It’s just one of those things where the pressure was probably going to be too much,” says Johnson. “I remember not being too mad, but that probably started the seed.”</p>

      <p> Mark Johnson knew the Russians; he knew how good they were. As the son of a coach who loved the international game, he was well-versed in the speed and skill of the Russian players. On Sundays he played in a series of games at the Dane County Coliseum his father called “The Russian Games,” his dad making up two teams from players in the area, one would be the Russians the other maybe Czechs or Canadians, Badger Bob making sure of two things: His team was always the Russians and his son was always on his side. He wasn’t Mark Johnson those afternoons, he was Valeri Kharlamov or Boris Mikhailov. His dad wearing a Kharlamov jersey or Vladimir Petrov jersey.</p> 
      <p> “His father had that much respect for the Russians being the best in the world,” says Helwig. “So Mark, even before he got to the Olympics knew all the players by name, knew what position they were, so in a way, that was a preparatory thing that his dad helped him to be able to perform against them.”</p> 
      <p> And Mark studied the Russians as part of the international teams his father would take to Europe.</p> 
      <p> “I traveled over and played in World Championships, watched World Championships, I knew how good the Russians were because I had seen ’em,” says Johnson, his voice sharp and serious. “A lot of people can say ‘yeah, well they were good’ well no, if you saw ’em play and you saw ’em play for a period of three, four, five years, I mean, they were real good. For us to even be in the same breath, say well if we do this and we do that we might have a chance, I mean, no, come on. <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/soviet-union-reliving-miracle-ice-nightmare-article-1.2120861">’Cause people that know hockey knew how good the Russians were.”</a></strong></p> 
      <p> ***</p> 
      <p> The game was played on Friday, Feb. 22, 1980 at Olympic Arena, the puck dropping at about 5 p.m. Thirteen days earlier the Soviets, winners of the previous four Olympics, had <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/russians-easy-u-s-olympians-fall-10-3-article-1.2023417">dismantled Team USA by a score of 10-3 at the Garden.</a></strong> The Americans weren’t supposed to get this far, but here they were, the entire country glued. It was a time when 52 U.S. hostages were being held captive in the U.S. embassy in Iran, 110 days at this point; the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan and an oil shortage forced the government to ration gas. Morale had hit bottom when the U.S. hockey team came on the scene, a group of young college kids playing out of their minds.</p> 
      <p> “People weren’t going to Lake Placid to watch the men’s hockey team,” says Johnson. “But halfway through the Olympics, that’s what it became, and so this buzz started. It happened, and after we tied Sweden and beat a real good Czech team, momentum started, it just sorta built to this Russian game.”</p> 
      <p> ABC wanted to move the game to prime time, but the Soviets wouldn’t budge.</p> 
      <p> “It would change today instantly,” says Johnson flatly. Instead, the game was tape-delayed in the U.S., airing at 7 p.m.</p>

      </div> 
      <p> A day before the game Johnson and the boys got an idea of what sort of impact they were having on the country when they saw a wall of telegrams, one on top of the next, thousands of them he thinks, going on and on.</p> 
      <p> “Top to bottom, length to length,” remembers Johnson. “They brought in mail in sacks, one sack after another with thousands of them and they pasted them up there from all over the world. Telegrams people were sending in, you know people over in Afghanistan, all these veterans, you know ‘go kick those Commies’ butts’ you know. So there was a lot of excitement, but then we had to go play the game.”</p> 
      <p> ***</p> 
      <p> Johnson’s first goal should have never happened. With the Russians leading, 2-1, late in the first period, defenseman Dave Christian fired a slap shot on net from beyond the red line with just five seconds to go. As most of the players began to head toward the bench, Johnson kept skating, scooting between two defensemen, picking up the rebound and slipping it past the stick side of Vladislav Tretiak, arguably the best goalie in the world.</p> 
      <p> “I look up at the clock and see five seconds,” says Eruzione. “I’m starting to skate toward the bench and all of a sudden Mark flies by me and I’m thinking ‘where the hell is he going?’ ”</p> 
      <p> It’s a clip Eruzione shows often in his many speaking engagements.</p> 
      <p> “You’re trained to play until you hear whistles or horns and so you keep going,” says Johnson.</p> 
      <p> Leaving a rebound is something Tretiak never does, says Johnson, who had studied the man for years. “He puts rebounds in the corner and that’s it, but he hesitated.”</p> 
      <p> Johnson pounced, scoring the goal and then quickly turning to check the clock.</p>

      <p> “Fortunately for everybody there was still enough time and it counted,” he says with a chuckle.</p> 
      <p> <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/coffey-viktor-tikhonov-loss-not-defined-article-1.2022264">Russian coach Viktor Tikhonov then crossed up everyone,</a></strong> benching his heralded goalie for backup Vladimir Myshkin.</p> 
      <p> “(The Russian players) were still pissed at (Tikhonov) 25 years later for doing that because it probably cost ’em the game,” says Johnson.</p> 
      <p> The game had changed. This wasn’t Madison Square Garden where the college kids were mere spectators, watching each of the Soviets’ 10 goals with wonder. They were in this, they were skating with the Red Army.</p> 
      <p> “You take (the game) in small increments. So instead of looking at three 20-minute periods, you look at one,” says Johnson. “And you focus in on 20 minutes. So you say, we need to be either tied or ahead after 20, and so when I scored with a second to go and it makes it 2-2, you come to the locker room and people are excited, it’s like we had won.”</p> 
      <p> Johnson’s second goal came at the tail end of a power play, one that was not going well, he remembers. Trailing 3-2 in the third period, and with just seconds remaining on the man advantage, the Americans caught a break taking the puck up the ice. Russian defenseman Sergei Starikov mishandled the puck in front of his own net, the puck sliding off his skates right onto Johnson’s stick. Johnson buried it between Myshkin’s legs. Tie game.</p> 
      <p> And before fans were even settled back in their seats Eruzione scored on a wrist shot to put the Americans up, 4-3.</p> 
      <p> The building exploded.</p> 
      <p> “Now we’ve got bedlam!” screamed ABC’s Al Michaels from the broadcast booth.</p>

      <p> “I tied it at 3-3, it got loud,” remembers Johnson. “When Mike made it 4-3, I mean, I thought the roof was going to come off.”</p> 
      <p> The game wasn’t over, though, far from it.</p> 
      <p> “Now you’re looking at the clock and you’ve got 10 minutes to go and it’s like ‘holy s--t, we’re winning,’ ” says Johnson. “Yeah, but there’s still 10 minutes to go. And that’s when sorta time stopped and everything stood still and you’re like ‘wow, ‘this could take forever.’  ”</p> 
      <p> It was during those 10 minutes, says Johnson, where the months of rigorous training with Brooks revealed themselves. The hours on the ice, the weight room, feet aching, legs burning.</p> 
      <p> “A lot of days you were trying to figure out why you were doing it, why was he pushing us so hard,” Johnson says of Brooks. “Well, that last 10 minutes against the Russians was why. We were able to skate, we were in condition, we were strong enough and we were able to play that last 10 minutes because of how we were prepared.”</p> 
      <p> The college kids did the impossible that day, holding off the Red Army with Johnson sending the puck out of the U.S. zone one last time just as <strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/raissman-michaels-famous-miracle-ice-call-resonates-article-1.2122379">Michaels made his famous call,</a></strong> “Do you believe in Miracles. . . .Yes!”</p> 
      <p> The players celebrated on the ice like little kids, barreling into one another in utter joy.</p> 
      <p> “It’s like Christmas Day and all your presents are there. Here we go,” says Johnson with a belly laugh. The memories overflow right onto his face.</p> 
      <p> “I often tell people who have seen the (movie Miracle) this many times that many times, ‘Do we still win?’ he says, laughing.</p>

      <p> “We keep winning, and that always puts smiles on people’s face.”</p> 
      <p> Two days later they completed the improbable run, coming from behind against Finland to win gold. Johnson scored the icer in that one; the picture of him celebrating hangs in his office. Badger Bob, who had been coaching in Colorado during the Soviet game, made it to Lake Placid just in time, and four years after cutting his son over Sunday dinner he watched him win gold.</p> 
      <p> The boys were then whisked off to the White House to have lunch with President Carter, who’d sent his plane to nearby Plattsburgh to pick them up.</p> 
      <p> “We’re getting in these buses going down to the White House and people are lined up along the street, hanging on telephone poles, they had flags and we’re all like ‘what’s this all about?’  ” says Johnson. “Finally, the bus driver says, ‘well, they’re here for you guys’ and we’re like ‘what? Come on!’ We had no idea. None. So, yeah, it was crazy. And that started it. Now we’re still talking about it.”</p> 
      <p> A country looking for something to feel good about had found it.</p> 
      <p> ***</p> 
      <p> The gloves were to go on sale for just three bucks. Johnson had been doing some spring cleaning some 30 years ago and found the gloves from the Soviet game and added them to his wife Leslie’s garage sale. He thought nothing of it. He was playing in the NHL then — where he spent 12 seasons (203 goals), his last five in New Jersey with the Devils — and had no use for them. Family friend Pete Giacomini intervened.</p> 
      <p> “I told him I had to save him from himself,” said Giacomini, who took the gloves for safekeeping. “Mark just didn’t understand.”</p> 
      <p> Giacomini ended up buying Johnson’s Hartford Whaler gloves instead. Those went for five bucks.</p>

      <p> “I was never big into memorabilia,” says Johnson. “If I was now, I could put together quite a collection.”</p> 
      <p> You’ll actually find little from his hockey career adorning the walls of his home. There are two things, however: A Leroy Neiman print of the 1980 Olympic Games, six members of Team USA skating alongside Heiden, among other athletes in a collage, and the torch he got when the 1980 team reunited in Salt Lake City to open the 2002 Winter Games. It hangs on a wall in his living room.</p> 
      <p> He shows that off with more pride than anything he did in 1980.</p> 
      <p> Not even in his basement will you find a shrine to Lake Placid. It will always be there with Johnson, just rarely on the surface.</p> 
      <p> About a year ago Johnson and daughters Megan and Mikayla were watching ESPN’s Top 10 Goals of All Time. Johnson streaked across the screen at No. 2. His daughters had no idea. Johnson just shrugged. The body language equivalent of “no big whoop.”</p> 
      <p> “He’s not a name dropper,” says Mikayla. And that starts with his own.</p> 
      <p> When eBay was just getting started, Giacomini convinced Johnson to autograph his hockey pants and put them up for sale on the site.</p> 
      <p> “What are you going to do with stinky old hockey pants that don’t fit you anymore,” says Johnson. “All of a sudden this thing starts to catch fire — $50, $100, $250, $400, $500, and I said ‘whatever we get we’ll split. Have dinner with a nice bottle of wine and enjoy,’  ” he says. “But this thing starts going up and we ended up getting 16, 18 hundred bucks, now I’d probably get 50 grand.”</p> 
      <p> It was more like $1,300, says Giacomini.</p>

      <p> Johnson has his jersey from the Soviet game and his medal, neither of them on display in his home. He disappears upstairs to retrieve the jersey, hanging from a wood hanger. He holds it up sheepishly, head down, looking at it front to back, as though it’s been a while since the two were together, looking at it like it’s an old friend. Only when asked does he even look up for a photo.</p> 
      <p> “If somebody wants to pay me a half a million dollars I’ll give them my jersey,” he says half kidding. “<strong><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/players-cashing-miracle-ice-merchandise-article-1.2122369">It’s not like Eruzione,</a></strong> where I can sell my stick and get 250 grand.”</p> 
      <p> Probably not, since Johnson’s kids have been beating it up for years.</p> 
      <p> The medal is here, too. Again he disappears to another room before casually handing it over inside its case as though it were a remote.</p> 
      <p> “It’s fun to watch people look at it when you go to a banquet or a function,” says Johnson. “Go ahead touch it. ‘Really?’ Put it on, take a picture with it. ‘Really?’ ”</p> 
      <p> His brother-in-law wanted the medal once so he just left it in the mailbox to be picked up. No big deal. His daughter Megan even took it to school for Show and Tell.</p> 
      <p> “I think the teacher almost had a heart attack,” says Johnson. The school even called to make sure he knew she had it.</p> 
      <p> “I think vaguely we probably did,” he says, chuckling yet again.</p> 
      <p> Johnson’s oldest child Doug accidentally flung the medal across the room once, breaking its clasp.</p> 
      <!-- HTML Element: 7.2331384 --> 
      <div class="a-module"> 
       <a class="a-module" href="http://interactive.nydailynews.com/2015/02/miracle-team-photo/" target="_new">

        </figure></a> 
      </div> 
      <p> You wonder if it’s ever been used as a puck.</p> 
      <p> And then there was the time, quite recently, when he was asked to show the medal off at yet another function and he couldn’t find it. He checked all the hiding spots, scouring his home for two days. Casual concern transitioned to genuine panic.</p> 
      <p> “I’m like freaking out. I didn’t get nervous initially, but then finally we call up Doug, my oldest and say, ‘Do you know where the medal is?’ And he’s like ‘Oh yeah, I got it hid.’  ”</p> 
      <p> Johnson still gets frustrated just thinking about it. “ ‘What did you do that for!’  ” he barked.</p> 
      <p> Doug was afraid it would get stolen. And for good reason, Miracle teammate Mark Pavelich sold his at auction a year ago for $262,000. Mark Wells’ sold in 2010 for $310,000.</p> 
      <p> But Johnson’s medal, he says, is not for sale. It’s something he’ll pass on to his five kids one day, all of whom took to hockey; it’s the family business.</p> 
      <p> “When I’m gone they can figure (out who keeps it),” he says. “I won’t have to witness that.”</p> 
      <p> He understands the significance now of those two weeks in Lake Placid, the burden that comes with that magical moment in history and what it means to so many, but it took time. “A lot of good things have happened because of that (game),” he says. “You don’t know it right away, but you have to understand the responsibility of the magnitude of that.” Part of that responsibility is talking about Feb. 22, 1980 to anyone who asks, speaking engagements, and worst of all, talking about himself. You get the feeling it’s like a second job, the benefit being more interest in the game of hockey.</p> 
      <p> He doesn’t make big deal out of his role in the greatest moment in American sports history, and is just fine with people not making a big deal out of him.</p>

      <p> ***</p> 
      <p> He’s on the ice again, this time at UW’s LaBahn Arena, coaching the women’s hockey team as he has since 2002, getting it ready for a weekend vs. rival Minnesota. After being an assistant to the men for seven years, Johnson was overlooked again, as he has been most of his life, when the head coaching job became available. He would have had the chance to take over the team his dad once coached. It wasn’t to be.</p> 
      <p> Instead, he’s created his own legacy, winning four national titles with the women, the second one coming on the very rink on which he won gold at Lake Placid, now known as Herb Brooks Arena. When it was all over he posed for a team picture in front of the Olympic torch, which still stands. Gray skies parted seconds before the photo was snapped.</p> 
      <p> And he got to return to the Olympics in Vancouver as head coach of the women’s team 30 years after Lake Placid.</p> 
      <p> There are 19 of those boys now. Old friend Bob Suter, also a son of Madison, died of a heart attack late last year; he and Johnson dueled as high school teens before teaming up at Wisconsin to win a national title in 1977. Suter was a defenseman in Lake Placid. Their high school battles were legendary, says Helwig, Johnson at Memorial, Suter at Madison East.</p> 
      <p> “Like anybody, you just don’t think that’s going to happen to anybody that’s close to you or part of that group,” says Johnson. “And now that it has, it sort of opens your eyes.”</p> 
      <p> Many of the teammates made the trip to Madison for the funeral. Johnson gave the eulogy.</p> 
      <p> “There’s a couple of get-togethers coming up in February (for the anniversary). If everybody comes, it’ll be the first time there will only be 19, which will be hard,” he says.</p> 
      <p> His shaggy brown hair of 1980 is now cropped and peppered gray, his baby face long since worn away. He skates about the ice as though strolling, never out of control, never stressed. His voice barely echoes.</p> 
      <p> He’s not a yeller, never has been; it’s not his style. But when his players do wrong, they know it.</p> 
      <p> “I wouldn’t call it the silent treatment,” says Mikayla, a sophomore on the team, Mark Johnson coaching his daughter at Wisconsin as his father coached him. “But you can definitely tell he’s disappointed and I think it’s worse. It hurts a little bit more, you feel it a little bit more.”</p> 
      <p> He coaches like his father, says Mikayla, creating an environment where kids enjoy coming to the rink each day, showing off a goofy side that puts his players at ease.</p> 
      <p> It’s always a great day for hockey.</p> 
      <p> Mark and Leslie have just one daughter at home now, the house getting roomier by the year.</p> 
      <p> He thinks about downsizing, getting a townhouse somewhere, then has a better idea. “Move out to the country, get a real ice rink, have the grandkids come out,” he thinks.</p> 
      <p> “It’d be awesome.”</p> 
      <p> Shinny hockey as it should be, just like when he was a kid, out in the freshest air, no parents, no rules and always beneath a ceiling unlimited.</p> 
      <p> Dive on in, the water is fine.</p> 
      <p> Just make sure to turn the lights off when you’re done.&nbsp;</p>
