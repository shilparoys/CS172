The talk, organized by Westmont’s chapter of the Phi Kappa Phi Honors Society, is free and open to the public. For more information, please call Professor Paul Delaney at (805) 565­6079.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Seeking to create a legitimate space of expanded public discourse, mommy bloggers have used blogging and social media conferences as a means for achieving personal and collective empowerment,” Song says. “This lecture will explore how face-to-face social media conferences function as a key mechanism for creating solidarity and status for a largely online industry. I will also examine the double-edged nature of commercial empowerment for women and mothers seeking meaningful forms of cultural legitimacy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deborah Dunn, Westmont professor of communication studies, and Wayne Iba, Westmont professor of computer science, will respond to the lecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Song is a sociologist whose research areas include new media and technology, culture, consumerism and public life. She graduated from Yale with a bachelor’s degree in history before earning a master’s degree in communication studies from Northwestern University and a doctorate from the University of Virginia. She taught at Louisiana State University before arriving at Westmont in 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her first book, “Virtual Communities: Bowling Alone, Online Together,” explores Internet communities and democracy. She has written on how expectant women use online information for health and consumer purposes. She is currently examining the emergence of women in social media while chairing the Westmont Sociology and Anthropology Department.&lt;/p&gt;

Tickets are $10 for students, seniors and children, $15 for adults, and can be purchased online at &lt;a href="http://www.westmont.edu/boxoffice" target="_blank"&gt;www.westmont.edu/boxoffice&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;For more information, please call (805) 565-7140.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The early 20th century European classic, written by Czech brothers Karel and Josef Capek in 1921, tackles themes such as threats of consumerism, nationalism and totalitarianism as told through the lives of insects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_10779" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-10779" src="http://blogs.westmont.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/D1X_7622-505x337.jpg" alt="Brent Starrh and Elaine Pazaski star in &amp;quot;The Insect Comedy&amp;quot;" width="420" height="280" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brent Starrh and Elaine Pazaski star in &amp;#8220;The Insect Comedy&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Today the play seems downright prophetic considering the time of its writing and the madness that was to grip Europe still 15 or so years in the future,” says John Blondell, who directs the play. “Though written in a decidedly different time and place, the play appears completely timely, pertinent and relevant — by turns, the play depicts scenes about the perils and pitfalls of romantic love; the desire for security and safety in a perilous, hectic modern world; and the larger global threats to personal and communal living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Though all this sounds very serious, the play is indeed a comedy, and we are working hard for it to be at once fantastic, human and funny.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_10778" style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-10778" src="http://blogs.westmont.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/D1X_7503-505x758.jpg" alt="Danielle Draper, Lindsey Twigg and Elaine Pazaski in &amp;quot;The Insect Comedy&amp;quot;" width="280" height="420" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Danielle Draper, Lindsey Twigg and Elaine Pazaski in &amp;#8220;The Insect Comedy&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The production crew includes Danila Korogdsky (scenography), Miller James (costumes), Jonathan Hicks (lighting), and Victoria Finlayson (choreography). Last year Blondell was honored by the Kennedy Center for his direction of “Pirates” and he received Westmont’s Teacher of the Year Award in the Humanities. While on sabbatical last semester, he traveled to Beijing to direct plays at the National Theatre of China’s International Shakespeare Festival. In addition to “Hamlet,” John directed the Bitola National Theatre (from Macedonia) in their performance of Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s “Henry VI, Part 3.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Insect Comedy,” although relatively obscure in this country, is famous in the Czech Republic and is performed throughout Europe and on many of the world’s great stages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The play has been at times exciting, harrowing, confusing and thrilling to stage,” Blondell says. “The trick is to find the humanity in the situations, to create moments that feel and seem potent and recognizable, all the while hanging onto the notion that the Capeks read human life through that of the lives of insects.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_10777" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-10777" src="http://blogs.westmont.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/D1X_7314-505x337.jpg" alt="Chloe Burns performs in &amp;quot;The Insect Comedy&amp;quot;" width="420" height="280" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Chloe Burns performs in &amp;#8220;The Insect Comedy&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blondell says at its deepest levels, the play asks the audience to consider what it means to be a person. “What does it mean to live,” Blondell asks. “And what does one do with this wild, precious life, once it has been given? These are good questions to consider, and they have formed the personal, imaginative and theatrical context to this play.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**On Saturday, March 7, “The Insect Comedy” plays back-to-back with Lit Moon Theatre’s production of Anton Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard” in an afternoon and evening of two fascinating European plays.&lt;/p&gt;

In case of inclement or overcast weather, please call the Telescope Viewing Hotline at (805) 565-6272 and check the Westmont website to see if the viewing has been canceled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising in Leo, Jupiter will be in good position for viewing in the early evening. “Since Jupiter has passed through opposition recently — and now rising just before the sun sets — we may be lucky enough to see a shadow cast onto its surface by one of its large moons,” says Thomas Whittemore, Westmont physics instructor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The viewing may also feature the Orion Nebula, M42. “Orion is high in the sky by 8 p.m.,” Whittemore says. “If the seeing is good this evening, we may be able to see six of the Trapezium stars in the heart of the nebula with Westmont’s 24-inch reflector telescope.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Milky Way, which contains a number of open clusters, is high in the winter sky and a popular viewing subject. “One of my favorites, M35 in Gemini, is a chain of stars with all sorts of subtle color variations,” he says. “This particular object will be best viewed in Westmont’s 8-inch refractor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mars and Venus are putting on quite a show in the west, although their alignment will make them unobservable with Westmont’s telescopes. “By Friday evening, they will be about a degree or so apart in this chance alignment,” he says. “The proximity of the creamy-colored (and bright) Venus with the fiery-red (and much dimmer than Venus) Mars yields a wonderful color contrast between the two objects. The public will be able to see this pairing early in the evening and with their bare eyes, but by 8 p.m. both objects will have set in the southwest.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The observatory opens its doors to the public every third Friday of the month in conjunction with the Santa Barbara Astronomical Unit, whose members bring their own telescopes to Westmont for the public to gaze through. The Keck Telescope is housed in the observatory between Russell Carr Field and the track and field/soccer complex. Free parking is available near the baseball field.&lt;/p&gt;

The public is welcome to plenary sessions of “Liberal Arts and the Social Good.” A complete schedule is available online at &lt;a href="http://westmont.edu/institute/conversations/2015_program/fullprogram2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;westmont.edu/institute&lt;/a&gt;. For more information, please call (805) 565­-6124.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speakers include Georgia Nugent, former president of Kenyon College, now leading the Council of Independent Colleges’ campaign; Anne Colby and Tom Ehrlich, co­-authors of several books on the importance of liberal education for the professions; Larry Bucciarelli, emeritus professor of engineering at MIT; and Marilyn McEntyre, writer, professor of medical humanities at the UC Berkeley­-UC San Francisco Joint Medical Program, and Gaede Institute fellow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Liberal arts education comes in for a lot of criticism these days,” says Christian Hoeckley, director of the Gaede Institute. “But we consider it irreplaceably valuable to American society. A strong economy, essential as it is, is not the only good thing in a society. Important aspects of our civic life are a real mess, and no other model of higher education explicitly seeks to foster engaged, well-­informed, and critical political participation. Our cultural life would be badly impoverished without the liberal arts. And a liberal arts education plays a huge role in economic strength and the job market. The skills that business leaders consistently rank as most important are those that a liberal arts education develops. If we let this model of higher education languish, we do so at our peril.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gaede Institute, created in 2001, promotes the continued vitality of the liberal arts tradition in American higher education. In May 2006, Westmont renamed the institute after its founder, former president Stan Gaede.&lt;/p&gt;

No tickets are required; the limited seating is available on a first-­come, first­-served basis. For more information, please call (805) 565-­6051.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lecture, “American Presidents and the Bully Pulpit,” anticipates the Westmont President’s Breakfast March 6 with historian &lt;a href="http://blogs.westmont.edu/2015/01/23/kearns-goodwin-to-speak-at-breakfast/" target="_blank"&gt;Doris Kearns Goodwin&lt;/a&gt;, who will speak about “Leadership Lessons from American Presidents” on March 6 at 7 a.m. in Fess Parker’s Doubletree Resort. Tickets to the breakfast, which cost $125 each, can be purchased online at &lt;a href="http://www.westmont.edu/presbreakfast/" target="_blank"&gt;westmont.edu/presbreakfast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knecht and Winslow will examine why U.S. presidents captivate and inspire us and why are we so quick to praise and excoriate them. The panel, moderated by Provost Mark Sargent, will consider Goodwin’s insights on presidential leadership and share their own research amid experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knecht, who teaches political science at Westmont, has written a book, “Paying Attention to Foreign Affairs: How Public Opinion Affects Presidential Decision Making.” He graduated from Stanford and earned a master’s degree and doctorate at UC Santa Barbara. He taught at the University of Denver from 2004­-2009 before coming to Westmont. He earned the Bruce and Adeline Bare Teacher of the Year Award at Westmont in 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winslow, director of Westmont’s Center for Social Entrepreneurship, is a 20th century U.S. historian whose research and teaching interests include race, family, gender, childhood, and social policy, especially in transnational and interdisciplinary contexts. She graduated from the University of Rochester, earned a master’s degree from California State University, Sacramento, and a doctorate at UCSB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Westmont Foundation sponsors Westmont Downtown: Conversations about Things that Matter and the President’s Breakfast to reach out and engage the larger Santa Barbara and Montecito communities.&lt;/p&gt;

And are all Christians really against science?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ecklund will discuss what scientists think about faith and what people of faith think about science using her 10 years of research on the subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="attachment_10731" style="width: 258px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-10731 size-full" src="http://blogs.westmont.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/McNaughton_David.jpg" alt="Dr. David McNaughton" width="248" height="255" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dr. David McNaughton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;McNaughton examines “Humility: From Sacred Virtue to Secular Vice” in an Erasmus Society Lecture on Wednesday, Feb. 11, at 3:30 p.m. in Hieronymus Lounge at Westmont’s Kerrwood Hall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McNaughton will consider how some virtues, like humility, rise and fall in importance over time or move beyond the domain of virtue altogether. He will examine the benefits of humility and probe whether it’s possible to rescue it from a secular context and once again admire it as a virtue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gaede Institute, which co-sponsors a variety of faculty-organized lectures, promotes the continued vitality of the liberal arts tradition in American higher education.&lt;/p&gt;

Alumni Jamie DeVries ’95 and Jillian Wilber ’13, who teach AP economics at San Marcos High School (SMHS) and advise KHK, brought nine of their students to the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since its beginning in 2002, KHK has raised more than $1.8 million and has spread its model to four other high schools in Augora Hills, Sacramento, Ojai and Denver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KHK empowers students to make a difference locally and globally. Internationally, KHK supports a safe house for children in Managua, Nicaragua, installed water purification systems in Honduras, and funded the building of a preschool in Rwanda. Locally, the group provides financial support to families of SMHS students by paying for such things as medical expenses and SAT/AP test fees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KHK’s main event is an annual benefit concert held at the Granada Theater that has featured artists such as Tyrone Wells, Sara Bereilles, Switchfoot, Andy Grammer and Ingrid Michaelson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vision for Kids Helping Kids came from DeVries, who has a strong passion for others. “I think the real meaning [in life] comes from serving people,” DeVries says. “People are eternal, we always forget that. Things pass away, they’re temporal, but people are eternal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wilber says that agreeing to advise KHK “ended up being the single most life­-changing thing I could have done.” She is thankful to wake up every morning to teach, serve and empower her students. “It’s great to take all that was poured into me at Westmont and turn it around and pour it into other people,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous honorees of the award, which celebrates the work of people making a positive impact in the field of education, have included Krista Beard, Casey Roberts, Ann Peak, Mary Osgood and three generations of the Hardeman family.&lt;/p&gt;
