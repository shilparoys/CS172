         <div> 
          <p>Prepare the following documents ready for presentation upon arrival at the airport. Be sure to hand-carry these; do not put these in your checked luggage. </p> 
          <h4>Valid Passport</h4> 
          <ul> 
           <li>You will need a passport issued by your country of citizenship and it must be carried whenever you travel to the USA and outside of the USA. The info on your I-20 form, I-94 card, and other official documents normally match the information in your passport. </li> 
           <li>Non-immigrants are required to have a passport that is valid for at least 6 months when entering the USA. </li> 
           <li>Green River IP recommends that you allow at least 6 months to renew your passport while in the USA. To renew your passport once in the USA, contact the closest embassy or consulate for your country of citizenship.</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h4>I-20 Form</h4> 
          <ul> 
           <li>Your I-20 indicates the start and end dates of your program, your level of study, major, financial cost of your program, and the source of your financial support such as family or government funding. It is your responsibility to make sure the info on your I-20 is accurate and up-to-date.</li> 
           <li>It is recommended you keep all original I-20 forms issued by Green River and other schools, as well as make back-up copies for your records. DHS may ask for copies of previous I-20 forms when you apply for work permission or other immigrant-related benefit (e.g. OPT, change of visa status, reinstatement, etc.)</li> 
          </ul> 
          <h4>Valid F-1 Student Visa</h4>

         <h3>Orientation Week</h3> 
         <div> 
          <p>We look forward to meeting all new students during <a href="http://grcc.greenriver.edu/international/orientation/index.aspx">Orientation Week</a>, which will provide a comprehensive orientation to Green River including: placement tests, class registration, campus tour, an overnight camp, and a trip to Seattle. It is very important to attend Orientation Week to get off to a good start on your academic journey at Green River Community College!</p> 
          <h4>Testing &amp; First Quarter Registration</h4> 
          <p>Students who have met the <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/international/admission/requirements.shtm">English Proficiency Requirements</a> for direct admission into academic programs will take the COMPASS test during <a href="http://grcc.greenriver.edu/international/orientation/index.aspx">orientation</a> to determine class placement. </p> 
          <p>COMPASS is a computer-based assessment of reading, writing and math. There is no time limit. Results are available immediately after completing the assessment, and during orientation students will be given the chance to take COMPASS up to two times for each subject area. Based on COMPASS scores, advisors will then register students for first quarter classes. Students can make changes to their class schedule, within the <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/Documents/student-affairs/assessment-testing/compass-placement-guide.pdf">guidelines of course placement</a> set by the school. </p> 
          <p>Appropriate placement is important as it impacts a student&#x2019;s progression through their program and academic success. Sequencing of courses is dependent on the requirements listed for each <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/academics/areas-of-study.htm">area of study</a>. </p> 
          <h4>Preparing for COMPASS Placement Testing</h4> 
          <p>Your advisors strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the COMPASS test in advance.&nbsp; The more that you prepare, the more comfortable you will be when you take the test and the better chance you have of getting a score that accurately reflects your skills. Students are allowed to use a basic calculator during the test. </p> 
          <p>For more information on the COMPASS test see:</p>

           <li><strong>Start Date</strong> - Not every university accepts students every semester or quarter. Make sure you can transfer and begin your program on the semester or quarter you want. </li> 
           <li><strong>Application Deadline</strong> - Most universities have a specific date by when you have to submit your application. Find out when the deadlines are for all the universities you intend to apply to and make sure all application materials are submitted by that date. Some universities have priority deadlines which means you can apply early and get a respond earlier. When you are looking at application deadlines, please follow the deadline for international students and NOT transfer students. You are an international transfer student needing an I-20 and you must follow the international student application deadline. </li> 
           <li><strong>Transfer Course Requirements</strong> - Some majors like Business and Engineering require that you to complete certain classes before you transfer. Most universities require that you have fulfilled those requirements before you transfer, not before you apply. </li> 
           <li><strong>Additional Test</strong> - Make sure you have the appropriate proficiency test (e.g TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, etc) and you meet the minimum requirements. If not, please register for the next possible test date. </li> 
           <li><strong>Transcript</strong> - Have your <em>official</em> transcript sent from Green River and any other university you have attended, plus high school if your school requires it. Official transcripts can be <a href="http://www.greenriver.edu/student-affairs/enrollment-services/transcripts.htm" title="Transcripts">ordered through the RegistrarÂs office</a> and should be sent directly to your transfer school. </li> 
           <li><strong>Financial Statement </strong> - Obtain your bank statement or financial support letter from your bank or parents stating you have the sufficient funds. Every university will state a minimum amount you have to meet to qualify for admission and issuance of I-20. Depending on the school, you might have to submit this with your application, or it may be required only after you area admitted and you confirm attendance. </li> 
           <li><strong>Online Application Account </strong> - We recommend you complete the application form online. Create your online application account on the school website and complete the form electronically. </li> 
           <li><strong>Personal Statement</strong> - Write your personal statement at least 6 month ahead. Take your draft to the Writing Center and give it as many people as you can for feedback. The Writing Center offers online submissions options as well as in-person help. International Programs also offers personal statement review help November-March on a drop-in basis Wednesdays (4-5) and Thursdays (2-3) in IVC 101. </li> 
           <li><strong>Recommendation Letter</strong> - If required, ask a faculty, advisor or anyone who can give you a good recommendation to write a letter for you. You may want to establish a relationship with the person prior to making the request. Be sure to give all references this request at least a month in advance and follow up very politely to make sure it was done a week before the deadline. </li> 
           <li><strong>Submission and Payment</strong> - Review your online application to make sure it is accurate and complete. Submit both application and payment electronically. </li> 
           <li><strong>Application Status</strong> - You may be able to check your application status online. If you notice your application is incomplete or if you receive a notification from the university regarding an incomplete application, please respond immediately and rectify the problem. </li> 
           <li><strong>Wait and Hope</strong> -Plan carefully and work hard so that you can sleep well during the weeks and months between submission of your application packet and receipt of your official admission decisions. The time after submitting applications is stressful for all students. This is a Ârite of passageÂ that everyone goes through in the US education system. We are excited to see where you will go! </li>

          <p><strong>How to transfer your SEVIS record</strong></p> 
          <ul> 
           <li>After you have been admitted to your transfer school, visit the IP office or email your advisor to obtain the Green River exit forms. Fill out Exit Form Part 1 and 2 and bring a copy of your acceptance letter. If new university requires their transfer-in form, make sure to print it out and give it to your advisor. </li> 
           <li>What date can your SEVIS be transferred? If you are currently enrolled, pick a transfer out date after the last day of your final quarter at Green River. Please contact your advisor if you have a special situation and have any questions about your SEVIS transfer date. SEVIS transfers will not be transferred until you have completed the quarter, have your acceptance letter, and have completed Exit Forms 1 and 2. </li> 
          </ul>
