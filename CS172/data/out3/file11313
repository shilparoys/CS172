      <p>There is a <strong>huge explosion of research in neuroscience</strong>. It’s a big frontier for new discoveries because of the wealth of new research techniques and the resulting new data.</p> 
      <p>Neuroscience is an outstanding background for medical school. Many <strong>medical schools are looking for students with grounding in humanities and social science</strong> so they can treat patients as whole individuals in complex communities.</p> 
      <p>Our alumni have gone on to grad school at <strong>Johns Hopkins, Albert Einstein Medical School, Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the University of Maryland</strong>. Others teach, work in the pharmaceutical industry and are even doing neuroeconomics for marketing, studying subconscious mechanics that influence consumer choices.</p>

               <p>The discipline of linguistics is concerned with language in all of the different ways it functions. When the material and approaches of any academic field are applied to language, that application is within the purview of linguistics. This course will expose students to some of the many areas in which language can be the topic, chosen from the following: philosophy, sociology, neurophysiology, cognitive and developmental psychology, foreign languages, evolutionary and cultural anthropology. It will draw on the expertise of professors from a variety of departments, each 'visiting scholar,' so to speak, presenting material from his or her own field as it intersects with the study of language.</p>

We will study elementary information theory as a means of quantifying the information-processing capacity of the visual cortex. This course will emphasize theoretical approaches to neuroscience, and complement the existing neuroscience curriculum, where the existing strength includes the study of the neural systems at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels with the experimental techniques.</p>

               <p>Computational neuroscience is the study of the brain as a computational and information-processing organ. It is a highly interdisciplinary field that employs various ideas and techniques from physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and (of course) neuroscience. In this course, we cover the following topics: biophysics of a single neuron; dynamics of neural networks; models of associative memory and object recognition; and numerical methods and tools for analyzing and simulating a dynamical system. We study the fundamental biophysical properties and processes of the neurons and their networks, while also learning to use several analytical and numerical methods for studying a complex dynamical system. The goal of the course is to develop an interdisciplinary approach for analyzing a biological system.</p>

               <p>This upper-level course introduces modern ideas about vision, based on empirical findings and guided by mathematical and computational considerations. We will consider how inherent ambiguities of the visual stimuli may be resolved through statistical inferences and estinamtions, and how such computations are impllemented by the population of neurons. We will study elementary information theory as a means of quantifying the information-processing capacity of the visual cortex. This course will emphasize theoretical approaches to neuroscience, and complement the existing neuroscience curriculum, where the existing strength includes the study of the neural systems at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels with the experimental techniques.</p>
