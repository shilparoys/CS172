       <h2>Wyoming Teacher Education Program</h2> 
       <p>The Wyoming Teacher Education Program consists of increasingly demanding phases of professional preparation. Competencies based on professional standards, including those mandated by the Wyoming Professional Teaching Standards Board (PTSB), are addressed developmentally. A teacher candidate graduating from this program will have mastered competencies required by the PTSB and the education profession. </p> 
       <p>Freshman year (Preprofessional): Students concentrate on the University Studies Program requirements. EDST 2450, Foundations of Development and Learning, must be completed prior to moving into Phase I. </p> 
       <p>Phase I: Sophomore students are introduced to teaching and learning through EDST 2480, Diversity and the Politics of Schooling. This course includes a field experience in a public school setting. </p> 
       <p>Phase II: A junior-level experience extends student competence through EDST 3000, Teacher as Practitioner. The practicum experience is in a public school guided by practicing K-12 faculty. </p> 
       <p>Phase IIIa/b: A two-semester sequence in the final year consists of fieldwork and pedagogy course work in the first semester. The second semester consists of a 16-week, full-time classroom experience. Field experiences are completed in Partner Schools. </p> 
       <p>Partner Schools are regional Wyoming district settings with collaborative agreements for concentrated field placements. These partnerships are focused on interactive mentoring by university and K-12 faculty and emphasize applied pedagogy. </p> 
       <h3>Admission to the Wyoming Teacher Education Program</h3> 
       <p>Effective fall semester 2013, matriculating students who meet the University of Wyoming’s standards for admission may declare their major in Elementary Education, Secondary Education in a specific content area, or Education Undecided (EDUD), provided that they&nbsp; have a minimum ACT Composite score of 21 and an ACT Math score of 21. A lower ACT Math score can be replaced by a Math Placement Examination (MPE) score of 2 or higher. Education Undecided majors should decide on a specific content area no later than the first semester of their sophomore year. <br><br>All incoming students pursuing teacher certification and/or teacher endorsement programs must undergo an initial criminal background check prior to full admission to the College of Education. Any costs associated with the background checks will be the students' responsibility. Specific information regarding this process can be found at: http://www.uwyo.edu/ted/background-checks/index.html). A second background check is included as part of the state application process for the Wyoming Substitute Teaching Permit, which is required for admission to Phase II of the Wyoming Teacher Education Program.<br>&nbsp;<br>For those students who do not meet the above admissions requirements, it is suggested that they major in general undeclared (UNDC) so that they will receive more appropriate advising and access to support services through the Center for Advising and Career Services until they have attained a minimum 2.75 UW grade point average (with at least 15 UW credits), and successfully complete an approved background check. <br><br>Current UW students wishing to change their major to Education but do not yet have a UW grade point average must wait until they meet the requirement of a minimum 2.75 UW grade point average, with at least 15 UW credits posted to their transcript. It is recommended that they complete a Change of Major form and contact the Office of Teacher Education in McWhinnie Hall, room 100 to initiate the background check process. Students’ progression through the Education curriculum could be delayed until all requirements are fulfilled and their major officially changed to Education.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Transfer students from out of state institutions, as well as from Wyoming community colleges wishing to declare a major in Education must have completed a minimum of 15 transferable credits, including the USP “QA” requirement (as determined by the UW Registrar) to do so. Transfer students must have a minimum Transfer GPA of at least 2.75 and successfully complete an approved background check.<br><br>For transfer students not meeting these requirements, it is suggested that they major in general undeclared (UNDC) so that they will receive more appropriate advising and access to support services through the Center for Advising and Career Services until they meet requirement of a minimum 2.75 UW grade point average (with at least 15 UW credits), and successfully complete an approved background check. <br><br>Re-admitted students who&nbsp; return to UW after two or more semesters away, and&nbsp; wish to (re-)declare a major in Education, must have a minimum 2.75 UW GPA (with at least 15 UW credits) to do so and successfully complete an approved background check.<br><br>Second Bachelor’s (SBA) / Post-baccalaureate teacher certification program students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.75 or higher from UW or from another accredited college or university, in order to declare a major in Education. A valid Wyoming Substitute Teaching Permit will be required, which will also serve as an approved background check.</p> 
       <h3><br>Academic Advising</h3> 
       <p>Students are assigned an academic adviser who will assist in planning a program combining University Studies requirements, core content requirements, and professional education courses. Students are expected to consult with their adviser regularly. The Office of Teacher Education coordinates advising and provides students and faculty with assistance in areas related to academic advising. </p> 
       <h3><br>Degree Program Curricula</h3> 
       <p>The following curricula summarize the programs offered by the College of Education. All students complete the University Studies courses, some of which may be counted towards the major. Courses may count no more than twice in College of Education degree programs. Students complete major courses as well as professional education courses. Additional requirements are: <br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.75 UW Total Institution grade point average<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ITEC 2360, Teaching with Technology<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.50 grade point average in the content courses required for each specific major<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A valid Wyoming substitute teaching certificate<br><br>Further information on each program is available in:<br><br>Office of Teacher Education<br>McWhinnie Hall room 100<br>Dept. 3374, 1000 E.

The College of Education does not accept either teaching methodology or student teaching coursework or credits completed at other colleges or universities.</p> 
       <h3>Student Responsibility</h3> 
       <p>College of Education students are responsible for knowing and meeting graduation requirements. Students are expected to maintain a 2.75 UW Total Institution grade point average to enter Phase II and III of the Wyoming Teacher Education Program and continue in the professional education sequence and to graduate from the teacher education program. Prior to enrolling in professional education courses, students are expected to have met the specific program and course prerequisites as listed in this publication. Students are expected to make reasonable academic progress toward completion of a degree. </p> 
       <h3>Graduate Study</h3> 
       <p>The four departments of the College of Education provide support for master's and doctoral degree programs.&nbsp; Faculty and staff work to deliver these programs by providing campus-based courses, courses taught through compressed video, courses taught on-site at different locations in Wyoming, courses taught online, and courses taught in hybrid formats.</p> 
       <p>The College of Education is dedicated to offering high quality graduate programs that will provide students with the necessary skills to become educational leaders within their areas of specialization and expertise. All graduate students in the College of Education are expected to become scholars, researchers, and practitioners. They must, therefore, be knowledgeable about the ever-changing literature and research in education, the characteristics and needs of learners, and methods for facilitating learning.&nbsp; They must also understand the process of change and how to facilitate changes in learning settings that reflect what is known about the teaching/learning process.&nbsp; These skills are important to all graudate students, regardless of their areas of specialization or major emphasis.</p>
