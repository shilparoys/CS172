       <td width="50%" valign="top"><h2>Student Educational Employment Program</h2> <p>The Student Educational Employment Program (SEEP) has two components, the Student Temporary Employment Program (STEP) and the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP). It is available to all levels of students: high school, vocational and technical, associate degree, baccalaureate degree, graduate degree, and professional degree students.</p> <h3 id="STEP">STEP</h3> <p>Job opportunities under this component offer you temporary employment that can provide you with a valuable work experience. Employment can range from summer jobs to positions that can last as long as you are a student (in one-year increments or less). The duties do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;have to relate to your academic field of study. Students in this program may be eligible for conversion to SCEP positions.</p> <h3 id="SCEP">SCEP</h3> <p>This component offers you valuable work experience directly related to your academic field of study. It provides formal periods of work and study while you are attending school. The program is designed to be a partnership between you, your school, and the USGS. SCEP combines academic classroom learning with practical, on-the-job experience and provides you with paid work experience in your field of study. The SCEP may lead to permanent employment after you successfully complete your education and meet work requirements.</p> <h3>Program Features Under Both Components:</h3> 
        <ul> 
         <li>Students may be employed year round.</li> 
         <li>Students may have flexible work schedules.</li> 
         <li>Open to all students...high school, under-graduate, graduate, and vocational/technical.</li> 
         <li>Students may be eligible for tuition assistance. (For specific benefits under both of these components, see&nbsp;<a href="#benefits_section">Benefits</a>.)</li> 
        </ul> <h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3> <p>You are eligible under the Student Educational Employment Program if you:</p> 
        <ul> 
         <li>Are a student enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a degree (diploma, certificate, etc.) seeking student.</li> 
         <li>Copy of a transcript will be required to determine eligibility.</li> 
         <li>Are at least 16 years of age at the time of appointment.</li> 
         <li>Are enrolled as at least a half-time student (or students who have been accepted for enrollment) in an accredited high school, technical or vocational school, 2-year or 4-year college or university, graduate or professional school.</li> 
         <li>Have a satisfactory academic record, 2.0 or better accumulative G.P.A. is required.</li> 
         <li>Are a U.S. citizen. Non-citizens may be eligible for employment if eligible to work under U.S. immigration laws and no qualified U.S. citizens are available for the position. (U.S. citizenship is required if you are converted to a permanent position from the SCEP.)</li> 
         <li>Are qualified for the position as stated in the vacancy announcement.</li> 
        </ul> <h3>Employment Outlook</h3> <p>Like the private sector, USGS is undergoing streamlining and restructuring to become more efficient. USGS is still recruiting people to provide critical services, and maintain our high scientific and technical expertise. We want to attract students who demonstrate the talent, skills, and abilities the USGS needs. USGS student vacancies are highly competitive.</p> <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <p id="HDR0" class="faq_questions">What is the definition of a student?</p> <p class="faq_answers">A student is an individual who has been accepted for enrollment, or who is enrolled, as a degree (diploma, certificate, etc.) seeking resident student in an accredited high school, technical or vocational school, 2-year or 4-year college or university, or graduate or professional school.</p> <p id="HDR1" class="faq_questions">How many credits or hours must a student be enrolled?</p> <p class="faq_answers">The student must be taking at least a half-time course load. The definition of half-time is the definition provided by the school in which the student is enrolled.</p> <p id="HDR2" class="faq_questions">How many times can a student be appointed to the Student Temporary Employment Program? Student Career Experience Program?</p> <p class="faq_answers">There is no limit on the number of times a student may be appointed as long as he/she meets the eligibility requirements for the appointment.</p> <p id="HDR3" class="faq_questions">Is a student pursuing a GED eligible for the Student Educational Employment Program?</p> <p class="faq_answers">Yes, a student enrolled in GED courses and pursuing a GED diploma meets the definition of student. Due to the general nature of the coursework, the student might not be eligible for the Student Career Experience Program, but would be eligible for the Student Temporary Employment Program.</p> <p id="HDR4" class="faq_questions">What are the age requirements for students to participate in the Student Educational Employment Program?</p> <p class="faq_answers">You must be 16 years of age.</p> <p id="HDR5" class="faq_questions">Does Veteran's Preference apply in the selection process for students?</p> <p class="faq_answers">Yes. Please see <a href="http://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/vetpref/">Veterans Preference</a> for further information.</p> <p id="HDR6" class="faq_questions">Can students receive pay increases?</p> <p class="faq_answers">Yes. If Federal employees receive an annual cost of living increase, all students would receive this increase. Additionally, students in the <a href="#SCEP">Student Career Experience Program</a> are eligible for what is referred to as within grade increases. For students in the <a href="#STEP">Student Temporary Employment Program</a>, eligibility for within grade increases depends on the pay system of the occupation. STEP employees are eligible for within-grade increases only when they are in blue collar positions involving trades, craft, or labor work. STEP employees in white collar positions (e.g., scientific, technical, administrative, clerical, etc.) do not receive within-grade increases.</p> <p id="HDR7" class="faq_questions">Can students be promoted?</p> <p class="faq_answers">Yes. Students in both programs are eligible for promotion. However, the Nature of Action Code (NOAC) for students in the <a href="#STEP">Student Temporary Employment Program</a> is actually a conversion to a new appointment (at the higher grade level) while keeping the current NTE date. Even though the actual nature of the action is a conversion to a new appointment, a GS employee is entitled to an increase in pay of at least two steps (about 6 percent) upon placement in a higher graded position without a break in service. A WG employee is entitled to an increase in pay of at least one step (about 4 percent). Please see the <a href="http://www.opm.gov/oca/">U. S. Office of Personnel Management Information on Federal Pay</a> for further information.</p> <p id="HDR8" class="faq_questions">Are students eligible for annual and sick leave?</p> <p class="faq_answers">Students in the <a href="#SCEP">Student Career Experience Program</a> earn annual and sick leave. Students in the <a href="#STEP">Student Temporary Employment Program</a> earn annual sick leave provided their appointment duration is for at least 90 days.</p> <p id="HDR9" class="faq_questions">Are students eligible for health and life insurance benefits?</p> <p class="faq_answers">For newly employed students, health and life insurance coverage for Federal employees depends on the type of appointment an employee has and the expectation of substantial employment during the year. Please see the <a href="#benefits_section">Benefits</a> section for further information.</p> <p id="HDR10" class="faq_questions">What are the limits on the length of a "break in program" which a USGS manager can approve for a student?</p> <p class="faq_answers">There are no limits, however, it is at the discretion of the USGS. The USGS should assure themselves that the student is making reasonable progress towards the attainment of the degree/diploma etc. and that the needs of the manager and USGS are also being considered.</p> <p id="HDR11" class="faq_questions"> May students still alternate school and work (i.e. work full-time this semester, and next semester go to school full-time, and not work at all)?</p> <p class="faq_answers">Yes. The student, school and USGS need to work together to accommodate the academic needs of the student and the work related needs of the agency. For students participating in the <a href="#SCEP">Student Career Experience Program</a>, there must be a written agreement and a formally arranged schedule of school and work. Please see <a href="/ohr/docs/9-3076.pdf">Form 9-3076</a> <img src="/images/icons/pdf.jpg" alt="in PDF format" width="16" height="16"> under the Apply section.</p> <p>Please note: To view PDFs install the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/readstep.html" target="_blank">Acrobat® Reader</a></p></td>
