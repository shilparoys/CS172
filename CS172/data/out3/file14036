         <h3>English 128 (Research Science/Business)</h3> 
         <p>Building upon the skills, concepts presented in ENGL&amp; 101, students in ENGL 128 will pursue the following learning outcomes: </p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><b>Critical reading</b>: Read and evaluate a range of sources in the sciences, engineering, and business; situate sources in their historical, social, political, economic and/or cultural contexts. </li> 
          <li><b>Writing process:</b> Practice writing as a recursive process that includes topic selection and narrowing, prewriting, research, planning, drafting, revising and editing, and use tone, style, organization, content, and argument to meet the needs and expectations of specific writing contexts and audiences to produce writing that is professional in format and appearance. </li> 
          <li><b>Academic arguments:</b> Identify, evaluate, and be able to develop the conventional components of an academic argument, including research question, claim, reasons, support, warrants (assumptions, values, beliefs, etc.), qualifiers, and engagement with multiple points of view. Respectfully consider and engage the diverse perspectives and intellectual contributions of others within the classroom. </li> 
          <li><b>Research tools:</b> Gain familiarity with a range of research tools and resources, including library materials, electronic databases, the World Wide Web, interviews, etc.; choose appropriate tools to find a wide and diverse range of secondary sources, including scholarly articles, and to evaluate critically those sources. </li> 
          <li><b>Research writing:</b> Learn and apply the conventions of various common forms of research writing, which may include annotated bibliography, research proposal, literature review, research-based argument, among others</li> 
          <li><b>Source Integration:</b> Accurately and effectively incorporate and comment upon references to a variety of sources; recognize the differences among summary, paraphrase and direct quotation and when to use each; cite sources according to documentation style guides appropriate to specific disciplines within the range of humanities (APA, MLA, CSE, CMS); understand and avoid plagiarism.</li> 
          <li><b>Research methods:</b> Recognize and analyze the various qualitative and quantitative research methods employed in the sciences, engineering, and business, such as survey, interview, ethnography, primary source analysis, observation, experiment, statistical analysis, among others. </li> 
          <li><b>Diversity:</b> Develop awareness of how social position and geopolitical location can affect identity, perspective, expression, and/or action. Evaluate how social, economic, and/or political power can affect the way ideas are produced, distributed, and received. </li> 
         </ul> 
         <p>To demonstrate proficiency, students will write a scholarly research paper that is at least ten pages in length (2500-3000 words) and incorporates at least eight diverse secondary sources; this paper should put forth an academic argument that includes a thesis or hypothesis supported by reasoning and evidence. Other formal and informal writing assignments must total at least an additional ten pages (2500-3000 words); these may include a literature review, research proposal, annotated bibliography, reading responses, research progress reports, peer reviews, reflective essays, self-assessments, essay exams, etc. </p>
