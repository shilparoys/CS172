    <summary>There are several opporunities available that are likely to be of interest to the alumni of our program. Please find four of these highlighted below. The first three are based in Golden, the fourth is based in Menolo Park, and the fifth is based at the Seattle field office. (1) Integrating Earthquake Ground Failure into Real-time Hazard and Loss Assessment. The focus of this opportunity is on research that will ultimately provide a more complete characterization of two earthquake-related hazards&amp;mdash;landslides and liquefaction&amp;mdash;in the immediate hours following a significant domestic or global earthquake. (Lead researcher David Wald, wald@usgs.gov). (2) Improving Earthquake Location Procedures Using Calibration Events and Signal Processing: Significantly Advancing our Understanding of Earthquake Sequences and Seismotectonics. The focus this opportunity is science that will ultimately provide a more accurate and consistent approach to earthquake location both for real-time operations at the USGS/NEIC, and for more research-based analyses of earthquake sequences and seismotectonic characterization. (Lead researcher Harley Benz, benz@usgs.gov). (3) The Integration of Geodetic Datasets into Rapid and Long Term Observations of Earthquake Properties. The focus this opportunity is science that will ultimately provide a more rapid and complete characterization of earthquake properties (i.e., location, magnitude, source characteristics) in the minutes to hours following major domestic and global events, and will concurrently improve our longer term understanding of earthquake cycles and domestic and global fault systems. (Lead researcher Gavin Hayes, ghayes@usgs.gov). (4) 4-D imaging of the active magmatic system underlying Mammoth Mountain, CA. We seek a Mendenhall Fellow to carry out seismic imaging of the Mammoth Mountain system, to help understand the magmatic and hydrothermal systems underlying the area.&amp;nbsp; For details please see the full announcement here: http://geology.usgs.gov/postdoc/opps/2015/15-5%20Hill.htm (Lead researcher David Hill, hill@usgs.gov). (5) The high-rate revolution: Studying tectonic deformation at previously inaccessible temporal and spatial scale. We seek a postdoctoral Fellow to study fault slip processes using new types of instrumentation and methods of analysis that measure ground deformation on time scales rarely sampled previously, from fractions of a second to hours.&amp;nbsp; In particular, strainmeters, GPS receivers, tiltmeters, and pressure sensors record with sampling rates as high as 20 Hz or more and have increased the dynamic range of measureable deformation by orders of magnitude, so that we can address key questions about how earthquakes and aseismic slip scale over the full spectrum of source sizes. Specific project topics may relate to earthquake source process studies, transient aseismic slip, as well as studies to better understanding of the measurements themselves.&amp;nbsp; (Lead researcher Joan Gomberg, gomberg@usgs.gov). Application deadline: February 17, 2015. Please contact one or more of the research advisors directly to discuss application proposals. For general information on the Mendenhall program please see: http://geology.usgs.gov/postdoc/opps/research.html</summary>

    <summary>The MATE Center and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) are pleased to announce that we are accepting applications for the 2015&amp;nbsp;MATE/UNOLS Six-Month Internship&amp;nbsp;through January 5, 2015. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Location:&amp;nbsp;R/V Oceanus&amp;nbsp;at Oregon State University Full Description:&amp;nbsp;This spring/summer (approximately March 20 &amp;ndash; September 25, 2015), the MATE Center and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet will sponsor one marine technical internship onboard the research vessel&amp;nbsp;R/V Oceanus&amp;nbsp;(http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/oceanus/). Interns will work with marine technicians on shore and at sea, learning how to operate and maintain a variety of scientific and navigational equipment in support of shipboard scientific research. The internship will begin and end in Corvallis, Oregon.&amp;nbsp; The exact schedule through September will be determined before the acceptance date, but will involve work on the&amp;nbsp;R/V Oceanus&amp;nbsp;and at their on-shore facilities.&amp;nbsp; Internship projects will be dependent on the funded science but previous interns have worked on cruises to support science ranging from chemical oceanography, marine biology, GIS/bathymetric surveys (seafloor mapping), geological studies, work with ROVs and much more! The position will last 6 months, and students will receive a stipend of $500 per week, reimbursement for travel expenses, and on-station housing while ashore.&amp;nbsp; For more information about marine technician careers, please visit&amp;nbsp;http://www.oceancareers.com/2.0/career_description.php?career_id=62&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For more specifics on a Research Vessel Marine Technician, see Steve Hartz&amp;rsquo;s profile here:&amp;nbsp;http://www.oceancareers.com/2.0/display_profile.php?profile_id=40&amp;amp;action=display. MATE internships focus on technology and scientific support of marine research rather than the academic research. This internship specifically aims to help recruit and train a new marine technician for the US Academic Research Fleet. The MATE Center encourages a diverse pool of applicants and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, or age.

    <summary>WOMEN IN GEOSCIENCES: IMPROVING YOUR CHANCE FOR SUCCESS** Tuesday February 25th, 2014 3:00pm EST Women have just as much opportunity for career triumph in geosciences (and other STEM fields) as men, and yet there is evidence that we are not paid as much as men, nor are there as many women in management and leadership roles in many industries. Why is this? We will explore how women can ensure their own success and enable their team members to thrive. We will also delve into some tricky issues, especially how women may sabotage their own success via verbal and non-verbal actions and non-actions, such as not negotiating. You will emerge from this webinar inspired with new tools to not only break the glass ceiling, but smash it to bits. **Note: Both women and men will find this webinar helpful and motivational in thinking about their own career advancement strategies and those of their colleagues.

    <title>Intern’s passion for seismology began with an IRIS school seismograph</title>

    <summary>Amanda Livers&amp;rsquo; interest in geology and earthquakes began in middle school. When choosing a topic for the science fair Amanda found IRIS&amp;rsquo;s Seismographs in Schools website and convinced her 8th grade science teacher that they should apply.&amp;nbsp; Their joint application resulted in Sidney Middle School (Sidney, MT) receiving an AS-1 seismograph.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Over the following year, Amanda installed the seismograph and began learning to use the software and interpret the data. She gave many presentations on the seismograph and what it could record to the other science classes in her district. She also used the AS-1 to compare the seismic sensitivity of the AS-1 and a homemade seismograph that she constructed. This investigation project won third place in the Middle School Earth Sciences Division at the Montana State Science Fair and received additional recognition as the University of Montana Geology awardee.&amp;nbsp; Amanda&amp;rsquo;s initial interests blossomed through undergraduate coursework in physics and geology, and ultimately led her back to IRIS through the Undergraduate Internship Program. During the summer of 2012, Dr. John Hole mentored Amanda as she worked with data from Salton Seismic Imaging Project.&amp;nbsp; Amanda is currently pursuing an advanced degree in near-surface geophysics at the University of Kansas.&amp;nbsp; Bringing this experience full circle, Amanda recently had an opportunity to return to the middle school she attended and talk to all the 6th, 7th, and 8th grade science classes. Her presentation on seismology used a number of the educational videos IRIS has created and even showed the students how their AS-1 seismometer worked. Amanda found the experience &amp;ldquo;neat to tell them how I used the AS-1 seismometer for a science project when I was their age, and now I am in graduate school for geophysics studying seismology!&amp;rdquo; 2012 Interns&amp;rsquo; interest for seismology started with a school seismograph in middle school (left), led her to IRIS for an internship with the IDOR experiment (center), and ultimately back to middle school to discuss her experience as a graduate students in near-surface geophysics (right).</summary>

    <summary>As the IRIS Undergraduate Internship Program ramps up for another great summer, there are still opportunities for you and your research to become involved!&amp;nbsp; 1) Apply to mentor an intern in 2014. This is a great opportunity to become the catalyst in the career of an exceptional young scientist while also furthering your own research. (Learn more) 2) Sponsor intern positions in 2014. Community PIs can use existing Broader Impacts funds or partner with IRIS EPO staff to write a short (2 page) REU supplement to their existing awards help the program reach our goal of supporting 15 to 20 interns annually. In addition to expanding the program, PIs would also further their research while mentoring an exceptional young scientist. If interested, please contact Michael Hubenthal (hubeth @ iris.edu) 3) Build intern positions into future grant proposals. Numerous community members have already leveraged the competency of the IRIS Undergraduate Internship Program to build strong broader impacts components of their grant proposals. Why not write one or two interns into your next proposal? It is an easy addition that reviews well and has the ability to make a powerful difference in the career of a member of the Next Generation of IRIS.

    <summary>2011 intern Kimmy McCormack's (left) internship project focused on developing receiver functions for seismic stations along the Ryukyu arc in southeastern Japan. The goal of the project was to attempt to determine whether any serpentinization has occurred in the upper mantle of the subduction zone. During the summer she received guidance from her mentors at Yale University; Maureen Long (right) and graduate student Erin Wirth (not pictured). Her summer's work concluded with a poster at the 2011 Fall AGU meeting. After AGU, Kimmy continued to pursue the project with her mentors while completing her senior academic year. The effort certainly has paid off as the results warranted development into a publication. McCormack, K., E. A. Wirth, and M. D. Long (2013), B-type olivine fabric and mantle wedge serpentinization beneath the Ryukyu arc, Geophys. Res. Lett., 40, doi:10.1002/grl.50369. Kimmy has recently graduated from the University of South Carolina where she has had a stand out academic and atheletic career. This fall she will be transitioning to the PhD program at the University of Texas, Austin. There she will work with Dr. Marc Hesse on porous media research and numerical modeling.

    <summary>The UAF Seismology Lab is home to two dozen faculty, postdocs, staff and students dedicated to advancing observation-driven seismology. Our research targets earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, glaciers and tectonics in Alaska and around the world. We monitor earthquake and volcano activity throughout Alaska in partnerships with federal and state agencies. The Lab houses the Alaska Earthquake Information Center and is a core component of the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The tremendous rates of tectonic activity make Alaska an unparalleled laboratory for seismology. We apply this real world experience to research projects around the globe. Current emphasis on Alaska from the EarthScope and GeoPRISMS programs make this a particularly exciting time. We are seeking an enthusiastic postdoc to join our group and lead investigations of tectonic and volcanic earthquake swarms. Complete position information is detailed in the links below.

    <summary>PhD students are sought to work on several seismological and geophysical topics within the Institute of Geophysics, School of Geography, Environment, and Earth Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington (VUW). Deep Fault Drilling Project, Alpine Fault &amp;mdash; several studies addressing the structure and evolution of the Alpine Fault in the South Island are underway, including analysis of data collected in shallow boreholes drilled into the fault in early 2011. Plans are now underway for deeper boreholes targeting the fault at 1.5 km depth, and students interested in working on the microstructural, seismological, or pressure-/temperature-monitoring data from the boreholes are encouraged to contact us. Volcano seismology: We are continuing to develop techniques to test whether time varying seismic properties such as isotropic velocity, anisotropy and attenuation can be used to determine changes in the magmatic system underneath volcanoes. Volcanoes in New Zealand and overseas are being targetted, in particular the recent eruption of Tongariro Volcano. Structural studies using seismic noise &amp;mdash; the use of seismic noise as a source of energy with which to study earth structure is a new technique that has been rapidly evolving in the last decade. This PhD will use several of the datasets discussed above to further develop the techniques and to determine the velocity structure in selected regions of New Zealand. Seismological studies of geothermal areas. We are developing projects focussed on seismicity and structure around geothermal fields in New Zealand. Possible PhD projects include: a) Microearthquake characterization of geothermal fields in New Zealand; b) ambient noise imaging of geothermal areas of New Zealand: c) Rock properties characterisation through seismic wave propagation. The next deadline for scholarship applications is 1 November 2012 and the application is free of charge: successful scholarship applicants from any country receive a NZ$23,500 stipend and all tuition fee payments.

    <summary>PhD Research Postion on "Modelling of the African Lithosphere Combining GOCE and Seismology" This four-year PhD position is offered within the department of Earth Systems Analysis, Faculty ITC at the University of Twente, the Netherlands, in collaboration with Utrecht University, Pennsylvania State University (USA) and is conducted within the framework of the AfricaArray project. The research is supported under NWO grant GO-AO/31 and part of the European Space Agency PI project GOCE4306 The proposed research will focus on innovative applications and combined analysis of GOCE satellite gravity data with seismological data in Africa. The research will focus on yet unexplained Earth structure on the borders of the Congo and Kalahari craton. Insight in this structure will be obtained through analysis of 3D gradient GOCE satellite gravity data and integration with surface wave tomography. For this purpose a unique seismological network will be installed to provide unprecedented seismological coverage to strengthen the satellite gravity inversions and provide unique geodynamical and compositional information on a previously poorly studied region. The candidate will focus on the development of a subsurface models based on satellite gravity and seismological data. The candidate will derive information on crust and upper mantle structure underneath station through receiver function analysis and in between through surface wave modeling and analysis of satellite gravity (gradient) data. This work will finally result in a compositional and geodynamic model for the region. It is expected to write a PhD thesis (based on articles) within the project duration of four years. Information concerning the research activities of the department of Earth Systems Analysis at the University of Twente can be found at http://www.itc.nl/4D-EARTH. &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>Annually, the Seismological Society of America (SSA) recognizes excellence in student research with its Student Presentation Award.&amp;nbsp; This year's list of eight recipients includes IRIS Internship alumni Justin Brown (Class of 2004).&amp;nbsp; Justin was recognized for his continued efforts to better understand factors that influence Tremor (abstract below).&amp;nbsp; Congratulations Justin! Justin was also recognized by the SSA community with a previous Student Presentation Award in 2008.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to browse the lists of past recipients when visiting the SSA website as other program alumni have also won this award. &amp;nbsp; Factors Influencing Tremor Occurrence in Subduction Zones BROWN, J. R., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, jrbrown5@stanford.edu; BEROZA, G. C., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, beroza@stanford.edu Tectonic tremor from multiple circum-Pacific subduction zones has been shown to consist of repeating low frequency earthquakes on the plate interface. Tremor/LFE occurrence in some areas exhibits episodic behavior down-dip of previous great mega-thrust earthquakes suggesting that the tremor may delimit the lower edges of large earthquake rupture. We investigate where and why tremor does (and does not) occur. We compare observations of LFE locations in five subduction zones: southwest Japan, Cascadia, Alaska-Aleutian Arc, Costa Rica and Mexico. We compare the LFE location patterns among the five areas with subduction parameters such as incoming sediment thickness, plate age, convergence rate and temperature. A preliminary conclusion is that temperature exerts a strong influence on LFE depth; warmer subduction zones (e.g. southwest Japan, Cascadia) experience tremor activity around 30-40 km depth, whereas cooler subduction zones (e.g. the Alaska-Aleutian Arc) experience tremor between 45-55 km depth. In addition, sediment thickness seems to play little to no role in tremor/LFE depths. This may be attributable to the amount of shear and chemical alterations that occur in the primary seismogenic zone up-dip from the tremor zone.</summary>

    <summary>Piage Czoski, an undergraduate at New Mexico Tech (NMT) and 2011 IRIS Intern, is just back from conducting research for her senior thesis in Antarctica. She arrived to Mc Murdo Station in late November and spent much of her time working on Mt. Erebus. Mt. Erebus ( 3,794 m in elevation) is the southern most active volcano located on Ross Island. Mt. Erebus has a lava lake that continuously experiences Strombolian eruptions in which large gas bubbles bursts at the surface of the lake throwing lava as far into the air. Czoski deployed six infrasound (sound that is below the human realm of hearing... less then 20 Hertz) microphones in a 30 m radius, spoke-wheel like pattern to better characterize signals coming from different sources on Mt. Erebus. While there are already some permanent infrasound sensors on Mt. Erebus, this array with its small aperture and geometry, will allow Czoski to differentiate signals much more accurately to determine the different sources. Czoski anticipates being able to identify and locate eruptions from the lava lake, ash eruptions out of another vent, rock falls from the crater rim, and perhaps ice quakes from glaciers breaking.</summary>

    <summary>We seek a postdoctoral Fellow to study &amp;lsquo;slow&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;fast&amp;rsquo; fault slip in Alaska and along the Aleutian arc, which are home to a 2500 km span of subduction zone and one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prominent volcanic arcs. These major plate boundaries have hosted episodes of aseismic slip and tremor and an extraordinarily high rate of large earthquakes, providing the opportunity to examine directly spatial and temporal connections between slow slip and earthquakes. Moreover, traversing Alaska and the Aleutian arc samples subduction beneath oceanic, transitional, and continental lithosphere of varying ages, permitting exploration of the range of physical properties under which these processes occur. The Fellow&amp;rsquo;s research will quantify the occurrence and extent of tremor using the seismic networks of the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) and the Alaska Earthquake Information Center. The Fellow also may investigate ties between tremor and aseismic slip, earthquakes, volcanic activity and deep subduction zone processes using Plate Boundary Observatory and AVO GPS data, and other data types. The Fellow may participate in scientific preparations for the 2015 arrival of NSF&amp;rsquo;s USArray and complementary Flexible Array and other studies, NSF&amp;rsquo;s GeoPRISMs program, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program drilling along the northern-most Aleutian trench in 2012. The Duty Station is Anchorage or Seattle. Applicants must have a Ph.D. or an equivalent degree. Research Advisors include Stephanie Prejean and Peter Haeussler (USGS Volcano Sci. Ctr., Anchorage AK); Joan Gomberg (USGS Earthquake Sci. Ctr., Seattle WA); Doug Christensen and Jeffrey Freymueller (Univ. of Alaska, Fairbanks AK).

    <summary>The following comes from W. Steven Holbrook at the University of Wyoming. Three alumni of our program are currently enrolled in the department (Austin Andrus 09', Eric Everson 07' &amp;amp; Katie Foster 09') as graduate students. &amp;nbsp; We announce an opportunity for students and early-career scientists to sail on the R/V Marcus G. Langseth in July 2012 on a 10-day cruise on the Cascadia continental margin off Grays Harbor, Washington. We will collect approximately 1000 km of 2D seismic reflection data, with the goal of improving knowledge of subduction processes and the location of the downgoing plate boundary. Berths for approximately 12 additional students/scientists will be available. The cruise is scheduled for July 12-23, 2012, though these dates could change up to one week in either direction; applicants should possess sufficient flexibility in their schedule to accommodate this uncertainty and must arrive in port at least one day prior to sailing. Travel funds will be provided to and from the port of departure (Astoria, Oregon). The goal of this call for open participation is to help expand the Langseth user base by providing opportunities for students and scientists to directly experience at-sea acquisition of marine seismic data. Participants must have a strong interest in learning field techniques in reflection seismology and be willing to work long hours at sea assisting in data acquisition and processing. Eligible applicants include graduate students and early-career scientists in fields related to marine seismology; in rare cases, senior-level undergraduates may also be eligible. Preference will be given to employees of U.S. institutions. All seismic reflection data will be made publicly available shortly following the cruise. Applications should be sent electronically by Jan. 31, 2012, to Dr. W. Steven Holbrook (steveh@uwyo.edu) and should include a 2-page CV and a personal statement (not to exceed 500 words) describing the applicant's experience in marine geophysics and motivation for participating in this expedition. Applicants who will be graduate students during summer 2012 must include a letter of support from their advisor. Participants will be ranked by the Marcus Langseth Science Oversight Committee, in consultation with the project PI's (listed below). Applicants will be notified by March 31, 2012. W. Steven Holbrook, University of Wyoming Graham Kent, University of Nevada Anne Trehu, Oregon State University Katie Keranen, University of Oklahoma Paul Johnson, University of Washington</summary>

    <summary>The winner of this year's alumni T-shirt design competition was Cate Fox-Lent (2003). After participating in the IRIS internship program Cate received her B.S. in Geoloical Sciences from Brown University in 2005. Currently, Cate is a high school science teacher in Austin, TX. Congratulations Cate! For her efforts, she will receive a t-shirt as well as an iTunes gift card. The second place winner, Megan Torpey (2010), will also receive a gift card.&amp;nbsp; A special thanks to the sponsor of the T-shirt design competition! The design (above) was inspired by Cate's submission and features a record section from the Honshu earthquake that occurred on March 11th, 2011. Waveforms ( 0.01 &amp;minus; 0.05 Hz BHZ ) from stations between 40 and 100 degrees were aligned on the S-phase to create a visually interesting stack. This section was then used to create a seismological "spoof" of the English post-punk band Joy Division's debut album, released in 1979. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) The time series data on the original album cover featured successive pulses from the first pulsar discovered PSR B1919+21 but I like the seismograms much better! We will hold a t-shirt design competion again next year, so start thinking of your ideas now.&amp;nbsp; You could be the winner next year! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>This week, May 30 to June 4th, the 2011 class of IRIS interns have gathered in Socorro, NM. This orientation week is designed to help the interns get to know one another and to provide them with an opportunity to learn the basics of seismology and computer programming. The week kicked off with a welcome dinner, bonfire and a number of get to know you activities. Day one of the program featured the deployment of 3 broadband seismographs behind the PASSCAL Instrument Center and an introduction to various seismology topics. Many thanks to Pnina Miller and the other staff who helped make the deployments run smoothly. Following this classroom sessions provided an introduction to the Grand Challenges seismology faces in the next decade (Rick Aster, NMT), an introduction to Earth's structure (Glenn Kroeger, Trinity U.) as well as an introduction to the realities of graduate school (Rob Porrit, a program alumnus &amp;amp; PhD student at Berkley). In addition to time in the classroom the group has also had several opportunities to get out into the field and see both the micro scale (from visiting faults) to the macro scale (a view of regional volcanism and rifting from about ~11,000ft).&amp;nbsp; We even squeezed in sometime at the NMT driving range &amp;nbsp; Lots more to go in the next two days of the week!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>Daniel Kluskiewicz, a graduate of Penn State University (2010), was recently awarded a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to support his graduate work at the University of Washington.&amp;nbsp; Kluskiewicz participated in the IRIS Internship program during the summer of 2009 where he worked with Shad O'Neel of the United States Geological Survey and the University of Alaska in Fairbanks to deploy an array of seismometers and time-lapse cameras around the Yahtse Glacier in South-central Alaska. He then used the seismic data he collected, along with video footage and first-hand observations of the glacier's activity, to characterize the seismicity of different types of glacier events and automate methods of detection and analysis. Congratulations Dan!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The NSF GRSP program is a excellent opportunity for funding your graduate education.&amp;nbsp; Thus, I would strongly encourage all our alumni to consider applying.&amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>The Institute of Geophysics, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand announces PhD scholarship opportunities at our university. We have several seismological projects of interest for which we would like to guide a PhD student: 1) Studies of the Sept. 4 2010, M=7.2 Darfield earthquake near Christchurch, New Zealand. An enormous amount of data has been collected and is being collected on this earthquake and its aftershock sequence. We will be studying aspects including the anisotropic velocity structure in the region and time varying seismic properties related to the earthquake. The project involves investigators in New Zealand and the United States. 2) We are in the early stages of an international collaborative project involving investigators from New Zealand, Japan and the United States to study the subduction zone structure under the Wellington region, North Island, New Zealand. The aim is to determine the material properties of interfaces (especially the subduction interface) at various depths, to try to understand the properties in a locked subduction zone. This project will combine active onshore-offshore seismic experiments (explosions and airgun sources) with passive (earthquake) recordings using short period and broadband recorders. 3) Ongoing studies of the Alpine Fault in the South Island are continuing, with recent success in funding for a project that will drill a 1 km deep borehole to study fault zone properties and their change with depth of exhumation. If you are interested in any of these projects, please contact Martha Savage. The application deadline is 1 November 2010 and the application is free of charge. Successful scholarship students from any country will receive a NZ$21,000 stipend and will not have to pay tuition fees. Further details including grant proposals are available upon request to Professor Martha Savage, martha.savage@vuw.ac.nz.</summary>

    <summary>This week, May 31 to June 5th, the 2010 class of IRIS interns have gathered in Socorro, NM.&amp;nbsp; This orientation week is designed to help them get to know one another and to provide them with an opportunity to learn the basics of seismology and computer programming.&amp;nbsp; The week kicked off with a welcome dinner, bonfire and a number of get to know you activities.&amp;nbsp; For example, below IRIS Interns were challenged to line up to create a human map of where they attend school during the year. &amp;nbsp; Day one of the program featured the deployment of 3 broadband seismographs behind the PASSCAL Instrument Center and an introduction to various seismology topics.&amp;nbsp; Many thanks to Pnina Miller and the other staff who helped make the deployments run smoothly. Following this classroom sessions provided an introduction to the Grand Challenges seismology faces in the next decade (Rick Aster, NMT), an introduction to Earth's structure (Seth Stein, Northwestern U.) as well as an introduction to the realities of graduate school (Rob Porrit, a program alumnus &amp;amp; PhD student at Berkley). &amp;nbsp;</summary>

    <summary>Not one, but two! Amanda Thomas (2005), a PhD student at UC Berkeley and Danny Brothers (2003), a PhD student at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, have each recently had their work published in nature. Congratulations to both Amanda and Danny! Amanda and her colleagues have identified a robust correlation between extremely small, tidally induced shear stress parallel to the San Andreas fault and non-volcanic tremor activity near Parkfield, California. They suggest that this tremor represents shear failure on a critically stressed fault in the presence of near-lithostatic pore pressure. There are a number of similarities between tremor in subduction zone environments, such as Cascadia and Japan, and tremor on the deep San Andreas transform, suggesting that the results may also be applicable in other tectonic settings. Read the full abstract. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Danny and his colleagues have linked historical earthquakes on the southern section of California's famed San Andreas fault to ancient floods from the nearby Colorado River."We found quakes happened about every 100 to 200 years and were correlated with floods," says Brothers. "The Colorado River spills, loads the crust and then there is a rupture." Read about this work on the web or the full abstract.</summary>
