               <p>All writers conceive of themselves as writing inside of a genre. If writing inside of a genre involved only the imposition of constraint, writers surely would not choose to do it. What is genre? How does it open possibilities for writing? How do genres change over time and across cultures? What is the relationship between literary genre and the way humans frame their emotional, intellectual, and social experience? The focus will be on a single genre (e.g., novel, lyric poem, tragedy, comedy, epic, ballad, gothic novel, graphic novel, etc.) .</p>

After reading some essays by biographers about the challenges that they have faced in their work, students will attempt to compose an argument of their own by drawing on letters, diaries, or other primary sources.</p>

               <p>This course explores the various ways that texts "answer" each other or imbricate each other. Writers often compose a text in response to another work (sometimes contemporaneous, sometimes distant). Writers also develop rivalries, write for each other as audience, feel especially influenced by or even possessed by another writer. In some eras, all literature is considered to be "part" of a larger project or in response to a "big" text (e.g., the Bible). Some literary works are written in the shadow of another language. Different theories of intertextuality will be covered.</p>

               <p>This course will examine the role of race in American politics and its contemporary significance to the nation's citizens, politicians, and governmental institutions. Questions will include: What are the primary intra- and inter-group dynamics that shape contemporary minority politics? How do the politics of race intersect with the politics of class and gender? What opportunities and challenges exist in mobilizing the members of minority groups for political action in the U.S.? What role have racial issues and attitudes played in the electoral strategies of political parties and candidates and in the electoral choices of voters? How do the structures and processes of American political institutions affect the efforts of minority groups to secure political influence? How has the rise to power of minority politicians-particularly in many urban areas-affected policymaking? How successful have minority groups been in their quest to use government to expand economic and educational opportunity? How are demographic forces likely to reshape the politics of race and -American politics more generally- in the 21st century?.</p>

               <p>An interdisciplinary approach is used to explore transformations in the cultural and emotional meanings of childhood. This course focuses on the development of institutions that serve their needs. It analyzes the disjunction between the social construction of childhood/youth and the lived experience. It examines how inequalities among children and youth vary based on class, gender, race, region, country, and their role as workers or consumers. The course also analyzes the political and economic commonalities among youth and children that relegate them to a separate and frequently segregated sphere of social life.</p>

              <dd id="9088-d">
               <p>This course investigates the origins of Native American religions, how they have changed, the reasons for those changes, and how Native Americans have influenced the beliefs of non Native Americans. History is the primary lens for this exploration. Issued such as Native American's relationship with nature and the supernatural are analyzed. Core concepts are presented and critically assessed with an emphasis on why Native Americans understandings mat differ from those of other religious groups. In the depth case studies are included, for example of Pueblos, Tainos, and Lakotas. The case studies may vary from year to year.</p>
