          <p>The All-USA Community College Academic Team recognizes high achieving two-year college students who demonstrate academic excellence and intellectual rigor combined with leadership and service that extends their education beyond the classroom to benefit society. Twenty team members are named annually with each receiving a $2,500 scholarship, a total of $50,000 in scholarship awards. In addition to scholarships, team members are featured in the USA TODAY newspaper and presented at the annual President’s Breakfast held during the American Association of Community Colleges Annual Convention.</p> 
          <p>Application for the program is by college nomination only. <br><a href="/resources/nominators" class="internal">Find your school’s nominator</a> </p> 
          <p>The application process opens in October and applications are due in early December each year. An independent team of judges reviews the applications to determine scholarship recipients. Phi Theta Kappa notifies students selected as team members in March each year.</p>
