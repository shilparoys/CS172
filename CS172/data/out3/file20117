          <p>The Coca-Cola Community College Academic Team recognizes high achieving two-year college students who demonstrate academic excellence and intellectual rigor combined with leadership and service that extends their education beyond the classroom to benefit society.</p> 
          <p>Fifty students will be named Gold Scholars, each receiving $1,500 scholarships; fifty students will be named Silver Scholars, each receiving $1,250 scholarships; and fifty students will be named Bronze Scholars, each receiving $1,000 scholarships. A state may have multiple Gold, Silver or Bronze Scholars. The program awards $187,500 in scholarships annually.</p> 
          <p>To be eligible for this program, students must submit an application for the All-USA Community College Academic Team and be selected as a nominee by their college. The application process opens in October and applications are due in early December each year.</p> 
          <p>An independent team of judges reviews the applications to determine scholarship recipients. Phi Theta Kappa notifies students selected as team members in March each year.</p> 
          <p>The Coca-Cola Community College Academic Team is sponsored by The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation.</p>
